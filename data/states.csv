(Photo courtesy Fuentes Espinal family)An Eastern Shore pastor who was arrested by immigration agents Monday and taken to Baltimore for processing is in good spirits and is preaching to fellow detainees — but that preaching is now being done at a detention center in Louisiana.
Daniel Fuentes Espinal, an undocumented immigrant from Honduras with no criminal record, was transferred Thursday from Baltimore to the Winn Correctional Center outside New Orleans, a family friend said Friday.
“He’s a remarkably resilient man, and for all of the trauma that he has been subjected to and the stress that’s been inflicted upon him and on his family, he is upbeat and his spirits are good,” said Len Foxwell, speaking for the family.
Fuentes Espinal’s daughter, Clarissa Fuentes Diaz, had been speaking for the family earlier this week, but is now declining interviews for fear of retaliation, Foxwell said.
Fuentes Diaz spoke to her father Thursday before his transfer. Foxwell said. He said Fuentes Espinal’s attorney filed a motion for a bond hearing, which was approved and will take place next week.
Fuentes Espinal, his wife and daughter fled violence in their native Honduras in 2001, when Clarissa was 8 years old, and eventually came to the Eastern Shore where they put down roots and where two more children were born.

Since 2015, Fuentes Espinal has been pastor of Jesus Te Ama Iglesia del Nazareno [Jesus Loves You Church of the Nazarene] in Easton — an unpaid position. He works in construction to pay the family’s bills.
Fuentes Espinal had gone to a hardware store for construction materials for his job on Monday and was on his way to work when he was stopped by unidentified agents and arrested on immigration charges and taken to Baltimore. The family only learned of his whereabouts when he called later that night, as the family was about to file a missing persons report, his daughter said earlier this week.
Fuentes Diaz recently learned that she had been approved for U.S. citizenship, after a 16-year wait, and said both parents had been working to get documentation. “I was going to help my dad and mom get their papers straight,” but that was before her father was arrested, she said earlier this week.
His arrest comes amid a surge in immigration detentions, part of President Donald Trump’s campaign pledge to enact mass deportations if reelected. The pressure to make arrests has led to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents frequenting areas where day-laborers gather, raiding businesses and sites that had previously been off-limits, like courthouses — and, according to critics, engaging in racial profiling to stop people simply for looking Hispanic.
In Maryland, immigration arrests jumped from about 3.7 per day in 2024 to 9.8 per day since Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, according to data from the Deportation Data Project.
While Trump and Department of Homeland Security officials have said their immigration enforcement actions are aimed at removing the “worst of the worst” undocumented criminals in the U.S., only 45% of those arrested this year have criminal convictions and 40%, like Fuentes Espinal, have no criminal charges.

Fuentes Espinal’s case has drawn extensive media coverage as well as the attention of immigration advocates and members of Maryland’s congressional delegation. Foxwell said a gofundme page he set up for the family quickly surpassed its original goal of raising $15,000, and then a second goal of $25,000. As of Friday, it was inching toward a new goal of $40,000, which he said will come in handy if the Fuentes Espinal has to travel to Louisiana.
In the meantime, Fuentes Espinal remains upbeat and is trying to console his family, Foxwell said Friday.
“His exact words to his daughter were: ‘This must be God’s plan,’” Foxwell said.
Fuentes Espinal said he has been ministering to his fellow detainees, both in Baltimore and in Louisiana, Foxwell said. 
“A preacher is going to preach, and he doesn’t necessarily need a church to talk about the grace of God,” Foxwell said. 
Fuentes Diaz told Foxwell that her father said he’s aware of the coverage his case has attracted, and he is grateful.
“He is a true man of faith who embodies the teachings of Christ each and every day of his life,” Foxwell said. “He is remaining upbeat and resilient under a set of circumstances that would break most other people.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2.-IMG_2263-cropped-e1753504625106.jpg,,,2025-07-26 10:56:17.780640

But as his administration pares back federal rules and programs designed to protect patients from the high cost of health care, Trump risks pushing more Americans into debt, further straining family budgets already stressed by medical bills.
Millions of people are expected to lose health insurance in the coming years as a result of the tax cut legislation Trump signed this month, leaving them with fewer protections from large bills if they get sick or suffer an accident.
At the same time, significant increases in health plan premiums on state insurance marketplaces next year will likely push more Americans to either drop coverage or switch to higher-deductible plans that will require them to pay more out-of-pocket before their insurance kicks in.
Smaller changes to federal rules are poised to bump up patients’ bills, as well. New federal guidelines for covid-19 vaccines, for example, will allow health insurers to stop covering the shots for millions, so if patients want the protection, some may have to pay out-of-pocket.
The new tax cut legislation will also raise the cost of certain doctor visits, requiring copays of up to $35 for some Medicaid enrollees.
And for those who do end up in debt, there will be fewer protections. This month, the Trump administration secured permission from a federal court to roll back regulations that would have removed medical debt from consumer credit reports.
That puts Americans who cannot pay their medical bills at risk of lower credit scores, hindering their ability to get a loan or forcing them to pay higher interest rates.
“For tens of millions of Americans, balancing the budget is like walking a tightrope,” said Chi Chi Wu, a staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. “The Trump administration is just throwing them off.”

White House spokesperson Kush Desai did not respond to questions about how the administration’s health care policies will affect Americans’ medical bills.
The president and his Republican congressional allies have brushed off the health care cuts, including hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicaid retrenchment in the mammoth tax law. “You won’t even notice it,” Trump said at the White House after the bill signing July 4. “Just waste, fraud, and abuse.”
But consumer and patient advocates around the country warn that the erosion of federal health care protections since Trump took office in January threatens to significantly undermine Americans’ financial security.
“These changes will hit our communities hard,” said Arika Sánchez, who oversees health care policy at the nonprofit New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty.
Sánchez predicted many more people the center works with will end up with medical debt. “When families get stuck with medical debt, it hurts their credit scores, makes it harder to get a car, a home, or even a job,” she said. “Medical debt wrecks people’s lives.”
Medicaid changes: Q&A with Jeff Reynolds, Rural Hospital Coalition of Louisiana

For Americans with serious illnesses such as cancer, weakened federal protections from medical debt pose yet one more risk, said Elizabeth Darnall, senior director of federal advocacy at the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Action Network. “People will not seek out the treatment they need,” she said.
Trump promised a rosier future while campaigning last year, pledging to “make America affordable again” and “expand access to new Affordable Healthcare.”
Polls suggest voters were looking for relief.
About 6 in 10 adults — Democrats and Republicans — say they are worried about being able to afford health care, according to one recent survey, outpacing concerns about the cost of food or housing. And medical debt remains a widespread problem: As many as 100 million adults in the U.S. are burdened by some kind of health care debt.
Despite this, key tools that have helped prevent even more Americans from sinking into debt are now on the chopping block.
Medicaid and other government health insurance programs, in particular, have proved to be a powerful economic backstop for low-income patients and their families, said Kyle Caswell, an economist at the Urban Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C.
Caswell and other researchers found, for example, that Medicaid expansion made possible by the 2010 Affordable Care Act led to measurable declines in medical debt and improvements in consumers’ credit scores in states that implemented the expansion.
“We’ve seen that these programs have a meaningful impact on people’s financial well-being,” Caswell said.
Trump’s tax law — which will slash more than $1 trillion in federal health spending over the next decade, mostly through Medicaid cuts — is expected to leave 10 million more people without health coverage by 2034, according to the latest estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The tax cuts, which primarily benefit wealthy Americans, will add $3.4 trillion to U.S. deficits over a decade, the office calculated.
The number of uninsured could spike further if Trump and his congressional allies don’t renew additional federal subsidies for low- and moderate-income Americans who buy health coverage on state insurance marketplaces.
This aid — enacted under former President Joe Biden — lowers insurance premiums and reduces medical bills enrollees face when they go to the doctor or the hospital. But unless congressional Republicans act, those subsidies will expire later this year, leaving many with bigger bills.
Federal debt regulations developed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under the Biden administration would have protected these people and others if they couldn’t pay their medical bills.
The agency issued rules in January that would have removed medical debts from consumer credit reports. That would have helped an estimated 15 million people.
But the Trump administration chose not to defend the new regulations when they were challenged in court by debt collectors and the credit bureaus, who argued the federal agency had exceeded its authority in issuing the rules. A federal judge in Texas appointed by Trump ruled that the regulation should be scrapped.

Almost half of the 63 million Americans who care for a family member say they struggle financially to do so. (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)More than 63 million Americans are caregivers for a family member with complex medical needs, a 20 million increase over the past decade, according to a new report.
But state policies, workplaces and the American health system haven’t kept up with this surge in family caregiving responsibilities, said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, a physician and the CEO of the AARP, which released the report with the National Alliance for Caregiving, a nonprofit policy and research organization.
“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.

The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, and also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers; Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before. And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.
Meanwhile, the historic cuts to Medicaid enacted as part of the GOP’s Big, Beautiful Bill Act will shift health costs to states, leaving experts worried that family caregivers could lose Medicaid-funded services they rely on.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Gov. Mike Dunleavy allowed three bills to become law this week without his signature, creating two fishing-related laws and one that updates the rules governing accountants in the state.
Under the Alaska constitution, a governor may sign a bill into law, veto it, or allow it to become law by taking no action on it after it is transmitted to him by the Legislature.
House Bill 31, from Rep. Louise Stutes, R-Kodiak, eliminates a state law that required fishing boats to register with the Alaska Division of Motor Vehicles every three years. Now, any boat that’s actively in use fishing and registered with the Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission and the U.S. Coast Guard will not have to also register with the DMV.
In a written statement, Stutes said the DMV registration — passed by the Legislature in 2018 — turned out to be excessive, particularly in rural Alaska.
“A lot of these communities don’t even have a DMV. Alaska’s commercial fishing industry is facing historically challenging times, and I’m glad we could implement this small step to make getting started for the year a little easier,” she said in the statement.
The second fishing-related bill was House Bill 116, which allows commercial fishing cooperatives to act like insurance without being regulated like insurance.
In some cases, fishing boat owners create pools of money to act as insurance funds to pay liability and damage claims themselves, bypassing the high rates charged by insurance companies.
Three pools already exist in Alaska but are organized under Washington state law because Alaska did not permit them. The new law enables pools under Alaska law, encouraging a cheaper alternative to traditional insurance.
House Bill 121, which also became law this week, lowers the training requirement for new accountants if they can substitute experience for classroom time. It also aligns some state accounting laws with model legislation used in other states.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Georgia man who admitted to illegally killing deer in Kansas and featuring the kills on his YouTube hunting show will pay $25,000 in fines and restitution, and is forever banned from hunting in Kansas.
Matt Jennings, 35, reached a plea agreement this week on two charges of violating the federal Lacey Act, which prohibits interstate commerce for wildlife taken in violation of state regulations. He is the host of “The Game,” which streams on YouTube and CarbonTV.
​“HUNTING is all I’ve ever known, to kill to eat… it’s what makes my heart pound and my soul fulfilled,” Jennings says on the show’s website.
According to court documents, Jennings primarily lives in Bowdon, Georgia, and sometimes resides in Woodland, Alabama. He traveled to Kansas in November 2022 with a tag that allowed him to take an antlered deer within a hunting area near WaKeeney in northwest Kansas.
On Nov. 11, 2022, Jennings killed an antlered deer near Florence in the central part of the state, which wasn’t covered by his tag. He drove to Oklahoma the following day to register the kill there, then returned to Kansas.
A week later, he killed another deer near WaKeeney. Although it was in the area allowed under his tag, the second kill violated state law by exceeding the bag limit of one antlered deer per season.
A joint investigation between the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service confirmed Jennings’ movements through phone data and social media posts.
Jennings featured the kills on “The Game,” which the show’s website describes as “a dark, in your face, more serious look at what makes a hunter tick.”
“It’s about pushing one’s self to the breaking point, and then looking back on the experience to learn from it,” the website says. “Matt Jennings takes you to the frontlines weekly to destinations in your backyard or worlds away. Either way, the intensity and drive this man has for the hunt will draw you to him and to what crazy things he will do next.”
Episodes feature him as a skilled bow hunter dressed in camouflage, with black grease around his eyes and cheeks. More than 62,000 users subscribe to the show’s YouTube channel. The most recent episode is from 11 months ago.
Recent comments on the videos berate Jennings.
“Hey Kansan here, stay in Georgia with that Poaching s***,” someone with the username “@Jimmy2toes4u” wrote in a comment on one of the shows. “Bad enough to see all the out of town plates much less guys who think their … ‘hunting show’ gives em the right to do whatever they want.”
The most recent post to the show’s YouTube account, from July 11, is a short promotional clip titled: “One day your life will flash before your eyes. Make sure it’s worth watching.”
Someone with the username “@lifesshort69” commented: “One day your show will flash before your eyes. Make sure your not a poacher and its worth watching.”
Under federal charges, Jennings faced up to a year in prison and as much as a $100,000 fine. Under the plea deal, he will serve five years of unsupervised probation and pay a $10,000 fine. He also will pay $15,000 in restitution to the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks Law Enforcement Fund in Pratt. He has to surrender the two illegally taken deer mounts, and he must retake an Alabama Hunter Education Course.
Jennings is prohibited while on probation from hunting, trapping, fishing or being with anyone engaged in those activities in Nebraska, Missouri, Oklahoma, Colorado, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois and Minnesota. He agreed to a lifetime hunting and fishing ban in Kansas.
In exchange for the plea, the federal government dismissed a charge from the original complaint and agreed not to file additional charges — unless Jennings denies his illegal activity or engages in additional criminal conduct.
Jennings didn’t immediately respond to Kansas Reflector requests for comment by phone and email.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)If the Supreme Court overturns Plyler v. Doe, the fallout will be devastating.
The 1982 decision, which affirmed that undocumented children have a constitutional right to attend public school, is already under siege. States like Tennessee and Oklahoma, are laying the legal groundwork to exclude or penalize these students, daring the court to strike down a precedent they never liked to begin with.
With the current court’s appetite for overturning landmark protections, that dare might just work. That’s why Maryland must act.
Our state should enshrine the right to public education in its constitution for all children, irrespective of immigration status. This isn’t just good policy; it’s a moral obligation. Marylanders say every child deserves a chance, that has to mean every child. Maryland’s Constitution, under Article VIII, already mandates a “thorough and efficient system of free public schools.” But nowhere does it guarantee that the children sitting in those classrooms can’t be turned away based on what documents they or their parents do — or do not — have. That silence is dangerous.
According to the Migration Policy Institute, approximately 15,000 undocumented children and youth are currently enrolled in Maryland’s public schools. If Plyler falls, and Maryland has no constitutional backstop of its own, the door cracks open to policies that chill enrollment, stigmatize immigrant youth and jeopardize public education.
Earlier this year, Tennessee lawmakers sought to enact legislation allowing school districts to verify immigration status and deny enrollment or charge tuition to undocumented students. It’s a clear challenge to Plyler, designed to climb its way to the Supreme Court.

Oklahoma sought something similar: an administrative rule requiring schools to collect immigration data at enrollment. These policies are strategic efforts, encouraged by groups like the Heritage Foundation, to chip away at the principle that every child deserves to learn.
In contrast, Maryland has the chance to lead. Again. In 2012, it was the first state to legalize same-sex marriage by popular vote. In 2024, voters enshrined reproductive freedom in the state constitution, among the first states to do so. In both cases, Maryland didn’t wait for disaster to strike. It acted. Not out of fear, but conviction.
The same boldness is needed now.
By amending the Maryland Constitution to protect the right to education for all students — no matter their immigration status — the state would provide clear, unambiguous legal protection. It would ensure that no future legislature or county board of education can quietly impose exclusionary policies. It would strengthen legal defenses in the event of federal overreach or local backlash. And it would say to the 7,000 DACA recipients and 31,000 TPS holders who live here: You are part of this community, and your children belong in our schools.
Courts in Maryland have already interpreted “thorough and efficient” to mean an adequate education under contemporary standards. In Hornbeck v. Somerset County, and later in Bradford v. Maryland State Board of Education, judges affirmed that education is a fundamental right in practice, if not fully in law. But without constitutional clarity, those interpretations are vulnerable.
We’ve already seen what happens when ambiguity meets political hostility. In 2024, more unaccompanied migrant children arrived in Maryland than any other state. These kids aren’t numbers on a spreadsheet — they’re human beings seeking stability, safety and schooling. And in high-profile cases like that of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident wrongfully deported to El Salvador, we’ve learned how fragile legal protections can be without explicit state recognition.
This amendment would be a declaration of who we are. By enshrining the right to education regardless of immigration status, Maryland will boldly affirm that every child belongs. It will fight exclusion, drive down dropout rates and open the door to opportunity for thousands of students who’ve been told — explicitly or not — that they don’t count.
Their dreams do matter. A child’s worth is not — and never should be — measured in immigration papers.
Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson saw it coming in her dissent in Trump v. CASA, warning of a growing “zone of lawlessness” targeting “the poor, the uneducated, and the unpopular.” That zone is spreading fast. Every time the federal courts step back from civil rights, the ground beneath us cracks a little more. Maryland can’t fix the whole foundation — but it can fortify its corner.
Let’s call this what it is: a test of whether Maryland’s values are weatherproof. When federal safeguards fall apart, do we hold the line? Or do we let fear and politics chip away at who gets to learn and who gets left behind?
Maryland has led before.  It can lead again.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/immigrationjan2222025-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-07-26 08:57:30.307420

Frank/NPS)Members of Montana’s congressional delegation have introduced bicameral legislation implementing a presidential order that will charge international visitors to America’s national parks an additional fee.
The state’s western congressional Rep. Ryan Zinke, a former Interior Secretary during President Donald Trump’s first term, along with junior U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy, introduced the Protecting America’s Treasures by Raising Inflow from Overseas Tourists in Parks Act (PATRIOT Parks Act), which could address maintenance backlogs at some of the country’s most popular sites.
“National Parks are Americas best idea and maintaining that legacy for future generations means making smart investments in the management of the parks,” Zinke said in a press release. “Americans already pay for parks in our tax dollars as well as at the gates. It’s unfair to American taxpayers to foot the bill for millions of foreign visitors. Almost every other country charges foreign visitors more, it’s common sense. President Trump and Secretary Burgum did the right thing directing the National Park Service implement a foreign visitor fee. This legislation will codify the policy and ensure Americans are put First in our own parks.”

The idea to raise additional funds from foreign tourists has long been championed by the Property and Environment Research Center, a Bozeman-based a “free market environmentalism” nonprofit think-tank. Sheehy once served on its board.
In preliminary Interior budget documents for the 2026 fiscal year released this spring, the federal government proposed a new fee on foreign visitors to address some of the shortfall in National Park Service budgets, but simultaneously showed an agency request of just $2.1 billion, roughly two-thirds of the NPS budget in 2025.
However, the latest version of the Interior appropriations bill, which passed through committee this week, showed a budget recommendation $3.1 billion — roughly holding current funding levels intact.
Last year was the busiest on record for the NPS, with more than 331 million visitors spending time at the 433 NPS units, including historic sites, battlefields and monuments, in addition to the 63 national parks.
The increased traffic at the nation’s crown jewels have added to a deferred maintenance backlog of nearly $23 billion to maintain roads, buildings, utility systems and other facilities across the park system.
According to researchers with PERC, because roughly 80% of entrance fees charged by some NPS sites are retained at the site they are collected, increasing gate revenue could help address specific maintenance backlogs at heavily trafficked sites.
In a study using NPS data showing baseline entry fee revenue of $349 million, PERC calculated a $16, $25 and $40 surcharge for foreign visitors, with an estimate that the surcharge would correspond with a roughly 3% decrease in visitation.
The smallest surcharge would generate an additional $211 million annually, while the highest would bring in $528 million — more than doubling the current revenue.
“The current system is relatively blunt — there are lots of margins you can refine in a logical way,” Watkins said. “That’s where I think you can see big changes happen.”
Early versions of the federal directive to increase fees on foreign visitors cited an additional $90 million in fees, but neither Trump’s executive order, the latest appropriations documents, nor the newly introduced legislation have specific dollar amounts set as revenue goals.
The PATRIOT Parks Act was co-introduced in the respective chambers with Rep. Riley Moore, R-West Virginia, and Sen. Jim Banks, R-Indiana.
“Our national parks drive Montana’s tourism economy by bringing in visitors from all over the world and define our way life by offering an experience you can only find in America,” Sheehy said in a statement. “Implementing a foreign visitor fee is an America First, commonsense way to secure affordable access for American families, improve our national parks for all visitors, and better manage our treasured public lands. It’s not too much for Americans to ask that their government puts them first, and that’s why I’m proud to support the PATRIOT Parks Act so more American families can enjoy our national parks for generations to come.”
Officials who have spoken about the proposed fee changes cite other parts of the world where foreign tourists are charged more than locals. The Galapagos Islands are commonly referenced, where foreign tourists pay $200, while Ecuadorian adults pay just $30.
“It is the policy of my Administration to preserve these opportunities for American families in future generations by increasing entry fees for foreign tourists, improving affordability for United States residents, and expanding opportunities to enjoy America’s splendid national treasures,” Trumps executive order stated.
The foreign surcharge, as defined in the PATRIOT Parks Act, would only apply to NPS sites that already charge entrance fees, and exempt monuments in Washington D.C.
Canadian citizens visiting Glacier National Park are also exempt from the fee, recognizing the joint stewardship of the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park.

Twenty-eight-year-old Michaela Bonner has been working 12-hour shifts as an emergency medical technician in Norfolk, Virginia, for the past four years, while attending and paying for college to finish her prerequisites for medical school.
But now that President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending law bars students from borrowing more than $50,000 annually in unsubsidized federal loans for medical school, Bonner is worried her dream of becoming a doctor is financially out of reach.
“I get told, ‘Well, we really need you. We have a physician shortage, and you’ve done all this work leading up to this point,’ and that’s true as well, and it’s not that I want to quit,” Bonner said in a recent interview. “But there are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can’t take out the full cost of living through loans.”

The tax and spending law includes provisions that significantly alter the student loan process for higher education. The law halts current student loan repayment plans for loans that are granted on or after July 1, 2026. On that date, the law also terminates Grad PLUS loans, which have helped people pay for their higher education degrees and total cost of attendance. Current borrowers will be grandfathered in.
The federal law gives current borrowers enrolled in loan repayment plans for students based on income — such as those plans known as SAVE or IBR — until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. Interest collection will resume Aug. 1 for students enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan.
At the same time, medical or law school students hoping to get unsubsidized federal loans — in which the borrower is responsible for paying the interest at all times rather than the government — will only be able to borrow $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in areas such as history or philosophy have a $100,000 lifetime cap.











There are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can't take out the full cost of living through loans.


– Michaela Bonner, aspiring medical student


The average yearly cost of medical school for the 2024-25 academic year ranged from around $42,000 to $72,000, depending on whether the school was private or public and whether the student was a resident or nonresident, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Some congressional Republicans say that students need to be working harder to pay for higher education, like medical school, on their own. Others say the caps put the onus back on colleges and universities to rein in the rising cost of tuition. But critics of this legislation say the loan caps are only going to harm students, especially from lower-income backgrounds, and will exacerbate physician shortages.
In recent years states have tried to ease physician shortages by implementing various policy solutions. Since 2023, at least nine states have made it easier for doctors trained in other countries to get medical licenses. States have also participated in interstate licensing compacts, allowing nurses and physician assistants to travel across state lines to work, so long as they are licensed in one state within the compact.
For student loan relief, more than 20 states have enacted legislation to address student loan forgiveness, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a group that tracks states policies. Georgia passed a measure that will expand a cancelable loan program for physicians working in rural and underserved areas. Idaho also created the Rural Nursing Loan Repayment Program, offering nurses $25,000 in forgivable loans after three years of service in a rural area.

McKenzie Richards, a health care policy fellow at the conservative think tank Cicero Institute who has been studying the pace of physician shortages, told Stateline that the national physician shortage could potentially exceed 100,000 by 2034. At the end of 2024 that projected number was closer to 64,000 physicians.
Richards said states will be looking toward more policy solutions should the student loan changes exacerbate physician shortages.
“We know what’s going to be happening coming down the line in just five years, so I think policies that states can adopt to get out of this are really important to be looking at now,” she said.
“The hope is that by capping [federal loans], it will encourage schools to lower tuition prices,” Richards added. “Then maybe they need to be admitting more students, which would have a great downstream effect for getting more doctors through.”
Other students will be in the same boat, said Lesley Turner, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Chicago and an economist.
“This is going to hit some students worse than others,” Turner told Stateline. “Those [students] in more expensive programs tend to borrow more, and so for those students they will need to return to private student loans or other ways of financing their graduate education.”
Many students were already questioning their capacity to go to medical school before the student loan caps, said Shannon Jimenez, dean of the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine.
“I expect that this bill, this cap, is going to push people out of primary care and into specialties to help pay off those higher interest rate loans,” Jimenez told Stateline. She added that caps will likely deter students from lower socioeconomic statuses from going into primary care — important in places like Arkansas, where she says there is a “maldistribution of physicians.”
“Many schools like us try to attract those students, because they’re more likely to go into primary care and serve in underserved areas. So it’s going to tie our hands in a lot of ways.”

Large states and more rural states will feel the gaps more deeply, said Richards, of the Cicero Institute. Louisiana, for example, is projected to be short almost 5,000 doctors from a variety of specialties by 2030, including close to 400 primary care doctors. Already more than a third of Louisiana physicians are close to retirement age — similar to the situation in neighboring Arkansas.
As for whether schools will just be able to lower tuition, Jimenez said, “it makes no sense.”
“We still function in a somewhat market-driven economy and have to compete with other schools around us, so our cost is based mostly on what we have to pay our faculty, and that’s not going to go down,” she said. The annual cost of attendance at her school is between $80,000 and $85,000.
Bonner, the EMT, holds a political communications degree from Regent University and now is studying biomedical sciences at Old Dominion University. She already has $20,000 in loans, she said, and for the rest of college tuition, she has paid out of pocket. Since she’s supporting herself, she hasn’t been able to save much.
She’d planned to take the medical school entrance exam next spring, but now worries about how she’d pay for living expenses while attending. “Medical school scheduling doesn’t allow for working, so you have to take out loans for living expenses,” she said.
“A lot of people, I feel, would be panicked if you had worked for eight to 10 years of your life and found out that all the systems that you were banking on in a really academically challenging space are disappearing,” Bonner said.
“I don’t see a path forward for certain, but I’m fighting to make one.”

Colorado, California, and Montana are among the states that have recently required safeguarding brain data collected by devices outside of medical settings. That includes headphones, earbuds, and other wearable consumer products that aim to improve sleep, focus, and aging by measuring electrical activity and sending the data to an app on users’ phones.
A report by the Neurorights Foundation, an advocacy group that aims to protect people from the misuse of neurotechnology, found that 29 of 30 companies with neurotechnology products that can be purchased online have access to brain data and “provide no meaningful limitations to this access.” Almost all of them can share data with third parties.
In June, the American Medical Association called for greater regulation of neural data. In April, several Democratic members of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether companies are exploiting consumers’ brain data. Juliana Gruenwald Henderson, a deputy director of the FTC’s Office of Public Affairs, said the agency had received the letter but had no additional comment.
Although current devices gather relatively basic information like sleep states, advocates for brain data protection caution that future technologies, including artificial intelligence, could extract more personal and sensitive information about people’s medical conditions or innermost thoughts.
“If you collect the data today, what can you read from it five years from now because the technology is advancing so quickly?” said Democratic state Sen. Cathy Kipp, who sponsored Colorado’s 2024 neural data protection bill when she was in the state House of Representatives.
As both excitement and trepidation about AI build, at least 28 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands have enacted some type of AI regulation separate from the privacy bills protecting neural data. President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” included a 10-year halt on states passing laws to regulate AI, but the Senate stripped that provision out of the budget reconciliation bill before voting to approve it on July 1.
The spirit of laws in Colorado, California, and Montana is to protect the neural data itself, not to regulate any algorithm or AI that might use it, said Sean Pauzauskie, medical director for the Neurorights Foundation.
But neurotechnology and AI go hand in hand, Pauzauskie said. “A lot of what these devices promise is based on pattern recognition. AI is really driving the usability and significance of the patterns in the brain data.”
Cristin Welle, a professor of neurosurgery at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, said that AI’s ability to identify patterns is a game changer in her field. “But contribution of a person’s neural data on an AI training set should be voluntary. It should be an opt-in, not a given.”
Chile in 2021 became the first country to adopt a constitutional amendment for neurorights, which prioritize human rights in the development of neurotechnology and collection of neural data, and UNESCO has said that neurotechnology and artificial intelligence could together pose a threat to human identity and autonomy.
Neurotechnology can sound like science fiction. Researchers used a cap with 128 electrodes and an AI model to decode the brain’s electric signals from thoughts into speech. And two years ago, a study described how neuroscientists reconstructed the Pink Floyd song “Another Brick in the Wall” by analyzing the brain signals of 29 epilepsy patients who listened to the song with electrodes implanted in their brains.
The aim is to use neurotechnology to help those with paralysis or speech disabilities, as well as treat or diagnose traumatic brain injuries and brain disorders such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s. Elon Musk’s Neuralink and Synchron, funded by Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, are among the companies with clinical trials underway for devices implanted in the brain.
Pauzauskie, a hospital neurologist, started worrying four years ago about the blurring of the line between clinical and consumer use of neural data. He noted that the devices used by his epilepsy patients were also available for purchase online, but without protections afforded by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in medical settings.
Pauzauskie approached Kipp two years ago at a constituent meetup in his hometown of Fort Collins to propose a law to protect brain data in Colorado. “The first words out of her mouth that I’ll never forget were, ‘Who would be against people owning their own brain data?’” he said.
Brain data protection is one of the rare issues that unite lawmakers across the political aisle. The bills in California, Montana, and Colorado passed unanimously or nearly unanimously. Montana’s law will go into effect in October.
Neural data protection laws in Colorado and California amend each state’s general consumer privacy act, while Montana’s law adds to its existing genetic information privacy act. Colorado and Montana require initial express consent to collect or use neural data and separate consent or the ability to opt out before disclosing that data to a third party. A business must provide a way for consumers to delete their data when operating in all three states.
“I want a very hard line in the sand that says, you own this completely,” said Montana state Republican Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, who sponsored his state’s neural data bill and other privacy laws. “You have to give consent. You have the right to have it deleted. You have complete rights over this information.”
For Zolnikov, Montana’s bill is a blueprint for a national neural data protection law, and Pauzauskie said support of regulatory efforts by groups like the AMA pave the way for further federal and state efforts.
Welle agreed that federal regulations are needed in addition to these new state laws. “I absolutely hope that we can come up with something on a national level that can enshrine people’s neural rights into law, because I think this is going to be more important than we can even imagine at this time.”

“Without my family, I’m nothing,” read the subject line of an email sent by then-state Rep. Gabe Evans to supporters on Sept. 10, 2023.
The email announced Evans’ candidacy for Colorado’s toss-up 8th Congressional District, and it began with a story the Fort Lupton Republican has told countless times throughout his political career — the story of his grandfather, Cuauhtemoc Chavez, who was born in Mexico and earned U.S. citizenship through his Army service in World War II.
“My family fought tooth and nail for the American dream so that future generations like me could have a better life,” Evans wrote. “And I plan on making that up to them in full.”
As a rising star in the Colorado GOP and loyal supporter of President Donald Trump’s agenda in Congress, Evans has leaned heavily on his Mexican-American heritage and the man to whom he referred in a campaign launch video as his “abuelito Chavez.” Telling and retelling the story of his grandfather, who died in 2014, is Evans’ go-to means of putting a more moderate face on the historically extreme mass-deportation policies backed by Trump and his top advisers.
“We are a nation that is ruled by law,” Evans told moderators at a January 2024 debate, responding to a question about how “millions of people living in the U.S. illegally” should be treated. “You need to go stand in that line and do it the right way, do it the legal way, so you are not leapfrogging over those folks like my grandfather, who did it the right way and did it the legal way.”
But Evans has mischaracterized the story of how his Depression-era ancestors achieved the American dream, and misstated key dates and details in his grandfather’s biography, according to documents obtained by Newsline through archival research and government records requests.
Those records show that the Chavez family, and a young Cuauhtemoc in particular, were squarely on the wrong side of the “strong immigration policies” his grandson now invokes his name to champion.
A 1941 Immigration and Naturalization Service document, obtained through a records request with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, shows that Cuauhtemoc entered the country unlawfully with his mother and siblings in 1929, at the age of 5, and resided unlawfully in Texas for the intervening 12 years. The document, known as an alien registration form, or an AR-2, was prepared shortly after Cuauhtemoc, then 16 years old, was arrested for an “immigration violation” in El Paso and “made the subject of deportation proceedings.”
At least two of Cuauhtemoc’s sisters were arrested by immigration agents on the same day, according to the nearly identical documents prepared for them. All three reported crossing the Santa Fe St. Bridge into El Paso on Dec. 9, 1929. Under a field for listing their reason for traveling to the U.S., the same typewritten words appear on all three documents: “to live, illegal entry.”
Cuauhtemoc’s AR-2 form also lists a prior, undated arrest for “attempted burglary,” placing the 16-year-old in a category of immigrants that Evans has said without exception should be deported. Evans was a vocal supporter of the Laken Riley Act, which was passed by Republican congressional majorities in January and requires federal immigration agents to prioritize the detention of any undocumented immigrant arrested for a “burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting offense.”
In the weeks preceding publication of this story, Evans appeared to acknowledge or accept the assertion that his grandfather had entered the country unlawfully in at least two interviews. His office could not point to any examples of similar disclosures during the 2024 election or before. Delanie Bomar, his spokesperson, first claimed that Evans had been “very consistent” and “clear about his family’s story,” but subsequently said his past comments may have been “confusing.”
“In Hispanic culture, immigrating the ‘right way’ generally means working hard, contributing to their community, and not causing problems — not necessarily that something is 100% perfectly legal,” Bomar wrote in an email.
Evans has described his grandfather immigrating “legally” or “the legal way” on multiple occasions, and as recently as June 24. Bomar declined to respond to questions about that language on the record and denied or ignored repeated requests to interview Evans for this story. After being sent a detailed list of questions about the documents Newsline obtained and Evans’ history of false statements about his grandfather’s immigration history, his representatives stopped responding to inquiries and ignored more than a dozen follow-up messages via phone, text and email.

“I’m more surprised than anything, but also at the same time, it doesn’t really shock me,” said Keilly Leon, north regional organizer for the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition.
“I think it just goes to show how harmful this rhetoric is — ‘I did it the right way’ versus ‘I did it the wrong way,’” added Leon, a Greeley resident and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipient. “Even folks that immigrated decades ago … experienc(ed) this way that the government has continuously allowed this broken system to separate families and force people to find other ways to come into the country.”
 Familiar anti-immigrant attitudes

By Evans’ own reckoning, his family’s story resonated with voters in Colorado’s battleground 8th District, where more than 3 in 10 residents are Mexican-American, helping propel him and other Republicans to victory in a 2024 election defined in large part by immigration and border issues. The 8th District, drawn by an independent redistricting commission in 2021, encompasses Denver’s northern suburbs and parts of rural Weld County.
“My story is the same as so many other stories in the Hispanic community that did it the right way,” he said in a June 24 radio interview. “They took the time and the effort to come here legally, to build a business, to start a family. And then they turn around and they see a bunch of folks rolling across the southern border, literally getting handed out taxpayer money for all of the different things that the Biden administration threw at them.”
Such rhetoric from Evans, Trump and other right-wing politicians did lead to a “fracturing” among Latino voters, said Romeo Guzmán, an assistant professor of history at Claremont Graduate University who studies immigration. But he said that may be changing fast as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents begin to carry out the Republican agenda. A CBS News poll released Sunday showed support for Trump’s immigration plans has fallen, with a narrow majority of Americans now opposed to his deportation program.
“There’s a kind of tension happening now, with folks who may have voted for Trump, thinking they’re somehow different from these unauthorized, quote-unquote ‘illegal’ immigrants,” Guzmán said. “What they’re finding out is that actually, for the Trump administration, for ICE, those differences are not as clear as maybe they imagined.”

Long before his grandson’s repetition of his story on the campaign trail, Cuauhtemoc Chavez belonged to a previous generation of immigrants who faced obstacles and prejudices closely resembling the ones faced by immigrants today.
In the wake of their country’s long and bloody revolution, record numbers of Mexicans entered the U.S. both lawfully and unlawfully during the 1920s. The arrivals fueled a restrictionist campaign that led to passage of the Undesirable Aliens Act of 1929, which expanded federal deportation powers and, for the first time, made crossing the border without authorization a misdemeanor criminal offense.
Evans’ great-grandmother, Luz Garcia Chavez, crossed into El Paso with her children five months after that law took effect, the INS records show. Without proof of lawful entry, the Chavez family became part of a large population of foreign nationals considered “deportable aliens” under U.S. immigration law.
Anti-immigrant sentiment deepened throughout Cuauhtemoc’s childhood in the 1930s. As the Great Depression set in, immigrants were blamed for taking jobs away from citizens, and for straining state and federal welfare programs. Young Mexican-Americans were vilified first as liquor-smuggling gangsters and then, after Prohibition’s repeal in 1933, as peddlers of marijuana and other drugs. Deportations increased, while as many as 1 million new arrivals and their children, some of them U.S.-born, were pressured into returning to Mexico as part of what became known as the “repatriation” movement.
“There is a lot of coercion that takes place, and a lot of fear tactics,” Guzmán said. “One of the ones that’s really well documented is this big raid of La Placita Olvera in L.A. that is very similar to the sort of raids that we’re seeing now — trying to have a show of force as a way to get people to go back.”
 Misrepresentations and discrepancies

At times, Evans’ statements about his grandfather have contained clear misrepresentations, such as a June 24, 2024, Facebook post stating that Cuauhtemoc had “immigrated … in search of a safer place to raise a family.” A day later, Jennifer Chavez, Cuauhtemoc’s daughter and Evans’ aunt, replied to his post.
“When your grandfather immigrated from Mexico, he was 5 years old,” Jennifer wrote. “Don’t be misleading.”
In a 2022 statement to Spanish-language newspaper La Prensa de Colorado, Evans, then a first-time state House candidate, wrote that Cuauhtemoc had “acquir(ed) citizenship in 1943,” while serving in the Army. In fact, records show that he did not apply for naturalization until several years later, in 1946. The discrepancy is significant because Cuauhtemoc’s naturalization petition indicates that he was granted citizenship under a 1944 law that eliminated proof of “lawful entry” as a requirement for naturalization.
Evans repeated the inaccurate timeline during his 2024 congressional campaign. He told the Berthoud Weekly Surveyor that it “took (Cuauhtemoc) 13 years to get his citizenship,” likening his wait to a story he’d heard on the campaign trail of a Colorado resident who “legally pursue(d) citizenship for 17 years.” But Cuauhtemoc affirmed twice — first on his 1941 AR-2 form and then on his 1946 petition for citizenship — that he had not previously applied for naturalization.

When contacted by Newsline, Jennifer Chavez said that while she wasn’t shocked by the news that her father’s family entered the country unlawfully — “that was just the way of life back then,” she said — their undocumented status was not common family knowledge.
“I don’t think anyone in the family has ever seen any of that,” Jennifer said of the INS forms Newsline obtained.
Like many American families, the present-day Chavezes are divided by politics, and Evans’ repeated invocation of Cuauhtemoc ​​to defend Republican policies drove the wedge further. Jennifer, who said she last saw Evans in person at a wedding in 2020, wrote an op-ed last year opposing his congressional candidacy. In an interview, she said her father and her nephew were on opposite sides of an estrangement in the family stretching back decades.
“Gabe, in reality, barely knew my dad,” she said. “They just didn’t see each other very often. My sister (Evans’ mother) just didn’t click with the family anymore. … He’s trying to cultivate the Latino heritage thing, but he really didn’t know my father, because he rarely saw him.”
Evans’ representatives didn’t respond to repeated requests to respond to Jennifer’s characterization of his relationship with his grandfather.
“For Gabe to portray my dad as being in support of someone like Trump would have gone over like a lead balloon,” Jennifer added. “He really misrepresented who my father was.”
When asked about another line from Evans’ campaign announcement email — in which he said that his mother, Rebecca Chavez, “thought she would spend her whole life in a one-room hut with a dirt floor in Juarez, Mexico” — Jennifer Chavez burst out laughing.
“We were raised in a middle-class neighborhood in El Paso,” she said. “We went to Eastwood High School, which was predominantly Caucasian. … To this day, none of us are fluent in Spanish.”
 ‘You need to go back’

During the 2024 campaign, Evans, though reluctant to answer the question directly, repeatedly affirmed his support for Trump’s plans to deport all of the estimated 12 million people living in the country without permanent legal status.
“​​If you are not lawfully here, you need to go back,” he said when pressed on whether he supported Trump’s “deport them all” agenda during a June 2024 primary debate. “Yeah, you go back, and you wait in line the way everybody else does in a law-abiding society.”

He softened that stance with his July 15 cosponsorship of the Dignity Act, a bipartisan proposal to provide relief from deportation to some undocumented immigrants.
The proposed relief falls far short of measures that once allowed Evans’ grandfather and other members of the Chavez family to acquire U.S. citizenship. Only those who entered the country prior to 2021 would be eligible for the program. Those who qualify would be required to pay $7,000 in restitution and be barred from accessing federal benefits, and the program would offer legal status but no pathway to citizenship — not even for so-called Dreamers, who, like Evans’ grandfather, were brought to the U.S. as children.
“No amnesty. No handouts. No citizenship,” Evans’ cosponsor, Florida Republican Rep. María Salazar, said in a press release announcing the bill.
Evans did not respond to questions about whether he supports the DACA program or a pathway to citizenship for anyone currently in the U.S. unlawfully, or why he believes immigrants today should be treated differently than his grandfather’s family was. He did not respond to questions about whether he feels he misled the public about his grandfather’s history and if he plans to change how he talks about it going forward.
Tensions have risen across the country in recent months as ICE agents begin the dramatic operational shift necessary to achieve Trump’s mass-deportation targets. The share of people in ICE detention without a criminal record has risen sharply, according to agency data analyzed by the University of California Berkeley School of Law’s Deportation Data Project. In Colorado, those recently arrested by the agency have included a family with a 1-year-old child attending an immigration court hearing in Denver; a 19-year-old Utah nursing student with no criminal record, detained after a traffic stop near Grand Junction; and prominent immigrant rights advocate Jeanette Vizguerra, a grandmother taken into custody outside her workplace, Target.
Evans has dismissed concerns about expanded ICE activity, accusing critics last week of “vilifying the law enforcement agents working to make our communities safer.” He championed the recent Republican reconciliation bill’s expansion of the agency’s funding, an $80 billion package aimed at quadrupling the scale of its detention and removal operations. He has continued to echo the anti-immigrant rhetoric that targeted young men like his grandfather a century ago, including by spreading false claims about crime rates following an influx of immigrants to Denver, and assailing Colorado’s “sanctuary” policies and a state-run program that offers health coverage to undocumented children.
There’s growing fear about Trump’s crackdown, Leon said, among immigrants in Weld County, a more rural area that lacks the vocal and organized network of advocacy groups that exists in Denver.
“We’re seeing that ICE agents are becoming more unpredictable,” said Leon. “These billions that are being thrown at ICE just harms our communities, it scares our children, who are a huge part of the Greeley community.”
“The idea that a group of people do it ‘the legal way’ or ‘the right way’ — the reality is that those categories have been slipperier and much more confused than we imagine,” Guzmán said. “Because ‘the right way’ is historically contingent on the laws that are impeding your movement.”
Soon after his inauguration, Trump launched an effort to end the centuries-old legal bedrock of birthright citizenship, a move Evans has refused to take a position on. In recent weeks, the president has threatened to “denaturalize” many legal immigrants, including New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani and other political opponents. Millions of people who entered the country over the last five years did so as lawful asylum seekers or under humanitarian parole designations like the temporary protected status program — legal avenues the Trump administration has moved aggressively to shut down.
“If you’re a refugee, what does ‘the right way’ mean?” Guzmán added. “It means you show up to the border and claim refugee status.”
“This is not a diss on anybody; people are not historians,” said Guzmán. “The problem, of course, is when people start claiming that their family did it one way, (and say) ‘why can’t you do it that way?’ — usually that’s code for both a lack of knowledge of their own family history but the larger ways in which immigration history has functioned for us.”

Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.

The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.










The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling.


– Oregon Republican state Rep. Cyrus Javadi


Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.

“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.
Trump’s deportations could cost 6M jobs, report finds

Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.
If Trump wants more deportations, he’ll need to target the construction industry

Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

Pete Ricketts could be a lot of negative as the ""same mistakes"" won't be made by Republicans.","A Dan Osborn flyer in a bar in downtown Lincoln on July 24. 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — On the same July day that registered nonpartisan labor leader Dan Osborn announced his bid against Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts in the 2026 midterms, the National Republican Senatorial Committee released a digital ad saying a social media account with ties to Osborn had liked gay porn.  
And Osborn, known for leading the pandemic-era strike for Kellogg’s workers in Omaha, argued that his working-class background makes him ideal to stand up to Ricketts and the billionaire class now running the country, alluding to the wealth of a family that created the company that became TD Ameritrade and owns Major League Baseball’s Chicago Cubs.
The tone of the NRSC ad and the Osborn rollout offer a stark contrast to the 2024 race between U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., and Osborn — and could signal the type of race to come between the industrial mechanic and a former two-term governor with Nebraska’s dominant political operation behind him.
Osborn’s bid against a senator with access to personal, political and Senate-incumbent money to campaign comes in an election year when Republicans, like most of the time when a party is in power, could lose seats and control of Congress. And it hits when some voters are losing faith in institutions and seeking alternatives. 
Attention paid
Osborn, who formally kicks off his campaign in Omaha this weekend, has Team Ricketts’ full attention after running a closer-than-expected bid against Fischer, who largely ignored him until he built a populist brand by barnstorming the state.
Populism, the political approach of appealing to ordinary people by saying their concerns have been ignored by the financial and political elites, is a driving force in modern politics. It was how President Donald Trump took over the GOP. And it feeds much of the populist left, including U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. 
Sanders, who stopped in Omaha to kick off his effort to motivate Democrats and independents after the re-election of Trump, figures prominently in some of the attack lines likely to be used against Osborn. Osborn said during his last race that as a labor leader he sometimes agreed with Sanders.
Dona-Gene Barton, a political science professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln who studies political behavior, including how people react to political messaging, said the race will get negative sooner this time around. 
“Fischer wasn’t really taking him seriously at the beginning of the campaign,” Barton said. “[Osborn] didn’t have as much name recognition, so she didn’t think that this was a serious contender.”

Ricketts told Lincoln ABC affiliate KLKN, that he and his campaign team “are going to continue to talk about and expose how left Dan Osborn really is.” 
When Fischer engaged later in her race against Osborn, she labeled him a Democrat in sheep’s clothing. 
John Dolan, Osborn’s campaign manager, said the message of the campaign against Ricketts is “fundamentally the same, but much easier to understand.” 
“Pete Ricketts is the living embodiment of everything we talk about. Billionaires own our political system,” Dolan said. 
Osborn flew under the radar against Fischer, Barton said. who treated him like an “unserious” candidate, employing a common strategy of not giving him free media coverage by discussing them during the early stages of the campaign. 
But Osborn, with a blend of economic populism and tough talk on some issues, including border security, devised an unorthodox platform that yielded one of the best performances for any nonpartisan Senate candidate in Nebraska. 
Fischer and her campaign “were caught a little flat-footed,” Barton said. 
He attracted an extraordinary fundraising haul for a federal candidate in Nebraska without direct ties to a major party, of $14 million. Fischer and Nebraska Republicans alleged that many of the millions that poured into Osborn’s 2024 campaign came from Democrats and Democratic-leaning donors. 
Fischer still beat Osborn by about six percentage points. But the race raised Osborn’s political profile. He launched a political action committee to support working-class candidates and encourage more “plumbers, carpenters, teachers, nurses, and factory workers to run for office.” 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Some U.S. Senate strategists and Nebraska Republicans said Osborn could already have had his “one bite of the apple” as an independent candidate. 
The Ricketts campaign team has relentlessly criticized Osborn, pointing out that he uses ActBlue, a fundraising tool often used by Democrats, and criticizing him for paying himself and his wife a salary with fundraising money, according to the latest campaign finance filings. 
Candidates who aren’t incumbents can receive a salary, and campaign funds can be used to pay them salaries as long as the pay represents a “fair market value” for “bona fide services,” according to the Federal Election Commission. Osborn paid himself while running against Fischer, too, saying he needed to be able to campaign without shorting his employer and co-workers by constantly leaving work.
Ricketts, as expected for an incumbent senator and a former governor, significantly outraised Osborn in the second quarter of 2025, according to campaign finance filings. 
Osborn reported raising $196,541 since his July announcement, while Ricketts raised $901,113 and his separate Pete Ricketts Victory Fund raised $1.2 million. His victory fund can be used for multiple races, political parties, and causes. 
Avoiding same mistakes
Ricketts has been a dominant political force in the state. He has used his own money to influence Nebraska politics. His endorsement carries weight. Some Republicans who crossed him in the Legislature have lost seats. And his operatives have a reputation for bare-knuckled brawling in political mailers.
One example came in 2020, when the formerly Ricketts-steered state GOP set its sights on long-time GOP volunteer, Janet Palmtag, because she ran against a fellow Republican, State Sen. Julie Slama of Dunbar in 2020.
Ricketts, who was then governor, appointed Slama to the Legislature in 2019 after former State Sen. Dan Watermeier left to become a member of the Nebraska Public Service Commission. 
The state GOP at the time paid for mailers that claimed Palmtag “broke the law” and “lost” her real estate license and was unfit to become a state senator. The claims were based on a 2017 case before the Iowa Real Estate Commission in which Palmtag, the owner of a real estate firm that operated in Nebraska, Missouri and Iowa, agreed to pay a $500 fine on behalf of her firm to resolve a mistake made by one of the firm’s agents.
The agent, who had been gravely ill, failed to obtain all the necessary signatures to transfer an earnest deposit for the sale of a home in Iowa, and Palmtag owned the real estate firm, so she was responsible for the firm’s work.
Palmtag sued the party for defamation in 2020. This year, a jury agreed with her that she had been defamed by the mailers and awarded her $500,000. The new post-Ricketts leadership of the state GOP did not appeal the verdict.
Some regional and national Republican strategists, including one from the group responsible for policing Osborn’s likes on social media, said the “same mistakes” made by the Fischer campaign would not be repeated this time around. 
“Pete Ricketts is a conservative champion who is working in lockstep with President Trump to protect the Good Life and put America first,” said Joanna Rodriguez, the communications director for the NRSC and a former Ricketts staffer. 
Will Coup, a Ricketts campaign spokesperson, told the Examiner, “Senator Ricketts has consistently worked for and voted to secure the border and cut taxes for Nebraska workers, families, and seniors.”
Rodriguez described Ricketts as a “strong messenger to call out Dan Osborn’s collusion with national Democrats to try to infiltrate Nebraska with their radical agenda.”
Osborn’s relationship with Democrats in the state is complex. He flirted with seeking Democratic support in 2024 until it was too late for the party to run its own candidate, which led to some Democrats grumbling at Osborn and his supporters for trying to minimize the number of names on the general election ballot for his Senate race, other than his and Fischer’s. 
Many Democrats kept the independent at arm’s length until later in the campaign. But he has many Democratic supporters, and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee gave him money once national leaders saw his momentum. 
State voting records show Osborn as a registered nonpartisan since at least 2004, as the Examiner previously reported. Osborn said he has maintained independence from the Democratic Party and, if elected, won’t caucus with either party. 
“I didn’t ask for that money,” Osborn said. “This time around, I’m not going to ask for it again.” 
The Nebraska Democratic Party has indicated that it has no plans to recruit a Democratic candidate to the race, saying in a statement that, “Breaking up the one-party stranglehold on our state is going to take an unlikely alliance of Democrats, Republicans, and Independents coming together to fix a very broken Washington, D.C.” A Democrat could file to run anyway. 
Osborn told the Examiner that Democrats and Republicans are “going to do what they do,” but he wants to show people that a candidate without a party can win in Nebraska or any state. He plans a retail campaign, centered around the “old school politics” of hosting about 300 public events around Nebraska. 
The “secret sauce,” he said, is to meet people and learn about the issues that voters face the most, because he is “applying for a public service job.” He said he knows winning, especially against Ricketts, would require strong fundraising numbers. 
Voter turnout in midterm elections is often lower than in presidential years. which could benefit Democrats as the party out of presidential and congressional power, Republicans have benefited more from high-turnout elections when Trump is on the ballot. 
Osborn says he wants to drive up turnout, because he’s at a “stronger” starting point now than in 2024 — with more people in the state who know who he is. They know that he’s “unapologetically for the workers and their issues.”
‘Does this guy have a shot?’
Another difference in this race is that Ricketts just won a special election to hold the Senate seat in November. So, the former governor could benefit from having been recently on the ballot, where he overwhelmingly defeated Democratic challenger Preston Love Jr., an Omaha civil rights activist.
Barton, the UNL professor, said Ricketts also is polling higher than Fischer in early polling compared to 2024. 
Osborn’s exploratory committee released a poll earlier this year, indicating he is statistically tied with U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts. The Ricketts camp called it “fake polling” meant to generate hope. 
Barton said she was one of the few Nebraska political observers who said Osborn had a chance in 2024. This time around, she said it would be a tall task for the former Omaha labor leader. 
“Does this guy have a shot? I would say no,” she said. “We have the results from that election that help us see what might happen this next time around.”
The nonpartisan Center for Politics, the home of Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball, changed the rating of Nebraska’s 2026 Senate race from Safe Republican to Likely Republican after Osborn’s announcement, a hint that Ricketts could be in for a fight. The Cook Political Report has the race listed as solid Republican.
“Senator Ricketts will work as hard for this election as he has for every election,” Coup said. “He’s taking nothing for granted and will earn the trust of voters.”

Last week, Gilliam, executive director of the University of Nebraska’s Buffett Early Childhood Institute, said he was on the phone advising Kentucky officials who want to pass similar legislation.

But in the state he’s called home since 2023, Gilliam said he has not witnessed meaningful movement toward legislation that would grow the amount of child care spaces. The inertia comes as the Buffett group puts the gap between potential need and capacity in the state at roughly 17,500 slots, despite Nebraska legislators saying child care should be a priority.
“States all over the country — red, blue and purple, contact us to be able to make a difference for child care in their state,” said Gilliam, who grew up in Kentucky and came to Nebraska from Yale University in Connecticut. “I can assure you their need is no greater than in Nebraska.”
More proactive states, Gilliam said, have “less of a gap between intent and action.” He is hoping that a new poll — aimed at better understanding what Nebraska Republicans, the state’s dominant voting bloc, think about child care — will help spur change. 
 ‘Serious’ challenge 

Buffett partnered with Washington D.C.-based Bipartisan Policy Center on the survey, which indicated 83% of Nebraska respondents agreeing (and 47% “definitely” agreeing) that child care is “essential for working families and a strong economy.”

Yet 75% said finding affordable and reliable child care was a serious challenge in their community. Nearly 53% named cost as the biggest barrier.
According to the national Economic Policy Institute, average annual expenses for infant care in Nebraska have reached $14,106, or about $5,000 more per year than in-state tuition for four-year public college. For a 4-year-old, child care costs have approached nearly $12,000 a year.
Among poll highlights: 

About 60% of respondents were concerned that child care barriers could disrupt the hiring and retention of workers.
Nearly 45% said they knew someone who turned down a job, promotion or reduced hours or quit working for lack of affordable and reliable child care.
Asked to select two sources most responsible for helping parents access quality child care, top picks went to: parents or families (56.6%); religious organizations (26.6%); employers (25.3%); community organizations (22%); state government (16.2%); local government (9.4%) and the federal government (7.8%).

 Intimately aware

Gilliam said child care is not a viable business model, as providers face high staff turnover and low employee pay. He said states such as Connecticut and Montana recognized that by this year creating state-driven trust funds to support early childhood education programs. 
He pointed out that New Mexico lawmakers established a similar fund in 2020 with about $300 million in seed money. The state designates a portion of surplus oil and gas revenues to help sustain the trust fund. In 2022, voters also approved a ballot initiative to provide further financial support for early childhood education programs.
Not every state has a surplus to dedicate, Gilliam acknowledged, but he said many do at various times. He views early childhood care as an infrastructure investment that helps grow a state’s workforce and economy.

State Sen. Brian Hardin, a Republican who chairs the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee, said he is intimately aware of the demand, need and challenges of child care — he co-owns a child care center in Denver. But when it comes to further government subsidies at taxpayer expense, the Gering lawmaker is wary.
“We are really good at starting entitlements,” said Hardin. “We are really really bad at shutting them down.”
He pointed to budget woes already facing the state and lawmakers in the coming session. Nebraska’s latest financial update puts the state’s current two-year budget in the red, facing a projected deficit of $95.3 million.

The solution to more accessible child care, Hardin said, lies in a multi-pronged “community” approach that starts with private businesses and employers. 
“A lot of employers have kind of sat back and kept their heads down, frankly, and have ignored that they have to step up … to offset some of that cost,” he said.
 Rural, urban, all idealogies

State Sen. John Fredrickson, an Omaha Democrat on the Health and Human Services Committee, said no one should be surprised by the results of the Buffett poll. Indeed, much of the Nebraska survey results align with a related national poll, which indicated that about 90% of surveyed Republican voters said child care was critical to families and the economy.
Fredrickson called child care a universal concern of Nebraskans — urban and rural parts and of all ideologies.
The Nebraska Legislature’s Planning Committee has called child care and affordable housing top state priorities, based on survey responses from state lawmakers. 
Next month, the committee is to hold another meeting on child care. But Fredrickson is not holding his breath for “transformational” child care-related legislation in the coming session.

“We seem to acknowledge these are top priorities, yet we have yet to make transformational and courageous investment in them,” he said. “Instead we’re glamorizing this idea of cutting, cutting and cutting at all costs.”
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen recently asked state agencies to submit proposals on how they’d reduce general fund spending by 10% next year, and he continues to repeat his pledge to run government like a business.











“We are really good at starting entitlements. We are really really bad at shutting them down.”


– State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering



Fredrickson said he hopes lawmakers still will make inroads for the child care industry, partly by continuing a push for fewer unnecessary regulatory or bureaucratic impediments. He noted the recent passage of a bill that streamlined background checks for child care providers.
Said Gilliam: “It doesn’t grow the amount of child care slots, but it does try to stabilize the child care workforce.”
 Steps forward 

Gilliam and others said Nebraska has implemented other changes that collectively have made child care more accessible to families.
In 2021, for example, the Legislature enacted a key measure championed by State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha, which expanded income eligibility levels for the child care subsidy program. According to First Five Nebraska, which focuses on early childhood care, that legislation made assistance accessible to roughly 2,500 more families. 
Fredrickson expects the Legislature during its next session to consider DeBoer’s Legislative Bill 304, which would make permanent the expanded income eligibility levels that went from 130% to 185% of the federal poverty level. 
A sticking point in LB 304, which stalled in committee state last session, is which funding source would cover added costs. 
If the measure dies, expanded income eligibility will expire in October 2026. And First Five says Nebraska “will plummet to the bottom of the nation for access to the child care subsidy, based on household income.”

 Rough fiscal climate 

First Five’s  2025 legislative roundup said the state’s fiscal climate made it hard this past session to advance major early childhood priorities, but it said the state did preserve “several critical early childhood initiatives that had been at risk of cuts or rejection.”
Deputy Director Elizabeth Everett of First Five wrote, for example, that the Legislature protected funding for the Sixpence early childhood education endowment cash fund. 
Progress last year included legislation, introduced by Fredrickson, that allowed a child care program to receive a subsidy reimbursement for kids under the direct care of their own parents who are employed by the program. 
First Five leaders also note a measure that incorporated the Nebraska Child Care and School Readiness Tax Credit Acts. The combined tax credits, they said, could provide up to $25 million in annual credits starting in 2024 to ease financial pressures on families, develop the early childhood workforce and incent private sector contributions to child care. 
“I think it’s fair to say that when it comes to child care in the state of Nebraska, nobody – parents, policymakers, or advocates – would say they are satisfied,” said First Five executive director Jason Prokop. “More work still needs to be done, and additional state investment should be made to help Nebraska’s families have better access to reliable, safe and affordable child care options.”



Sizing up Republican views 
About 475 Nebraskans, largely Republicans and a slice of nonpartisan voters, were surveyed in June as part of a larger national poll that included an oversample of Nebraskans by the polling firm Cygnal. 
The poll was commissioned by Washington D.C.-based Bipartisan Policy Center and the Omaha-based Buffett Early Childhood Institute covered the oversample cost.
More of the Nebraska results:

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)State lawmakers across the country filed more bills to restrict or protect libraries and readers in the first half of this year than last year, a new report found.
The split fell largely along geographic lines, according to the report from EveryLibrary, a group that advocates against book bans and censorship.
Between January and July 2025, lawmakers introduced 133 bills that the organization deemed harmful to libraries, librarians or readers’ rights in 33 states — an increase from 121 bills in all of 2024. Fourteen of those measures had passed as of mid-July.
At the same time, legislators introduced 76 bills in 32 states to protect library services or affirm the right to read, the report found.

The geographic split among these policies is stark.
In Southern and Plains states, new laws increasingly criminalize certain actions of librarians, restrict access to materials about gender and race, and transfer decision-making power to politically appointed boards or parent-led councils.
Texas alone passed a trio of sweeping laws stripping educators of certain legal protections when providing potentially obscene materials; banning public funding for instructional materials containing obscene content; and giving parents more authority over student reading choices and new library additions.
Tennessee lowered the bar to prosecute educators for sharing books that might be considered “harmful to minors.”
A New Hampshire bill likewise would’ve made it easier for parents or the state attorney general to bring civil actions against school employees for distributing material deemed harmful to minors, but it was vetoed by Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte.
In Nebraska, a new law allows for real-time alerts for parents every time a student checks out a book. South Dakota requires libraries and schools to install filtering software. New laws in Idaho heighten the requirements to form library districts and mandate stricter internet filtering policies that are tied to state funding.

In contrast, several Northeastern states have passed legislation protections for libraries and librarians and anti-censorship laws.
New Jersey, Delaware, Rhode Island and Connecticut have each enacted “freedom to read” or other laws that codify protections against ideological censorship in libraries.
Connecticut also took a major step in modernizing libraries in the digital age, the report said, becoming the first state in the nation to pass a law regulating how libraries license and manage e-books and digital audiobooks.

(Photo: Energy & Policy Institute)As North Carolina lawmakers prepare to override Gov. Josh Stein’s veto of a controversial energy bill, constituents are receiving mailers from a dark money entity with ties to Duke Energy’s industrial and commercial customers.
Citizens for NC Jobs registered with the state as a nonprofit in January and launched a Facebook page three days after lawmakers introduced the legislation in March. The group is specifically targeting Democrats who voted with Republicans to pass the measure, likely aiming to maintain the members’ support ahead of the override vote.
Senate Bill 266 eliminates Duke Energy’s 2030 carbon emissions limits and shifts costs and risks from the company’s shareholders and industrial customers – including power-hungry data centers – to residential users. Eleven Democrats in the House and three Democrats in the state Senate broke with their party last month and joined the Republican majority to pass the controversial bill.
The measure aims to make building large-scale methane gas and nuclear plants more economically attractive for Duke Energy by forcing customers to pay for them before the plants are operational through a financing mechanism called construction work in progress or CWIP. With CWIP, customers rather than shareholders would be on the hook for repayment if a project falls through. The consequences of CWIP continue to be evident in South Carolina, where Santee Cooper customers are still paying $9 billion for an abandoned nuclear reactor project at the V.C. Summer plant, which never generated power due to delays and cost overruns.  After the Summer project collapsed, four executives from a partner utility company involved in the project were criminally sentenced for fraud and lying to federal investigators.
S. 266 would also shift costs from large-load customers to residential users. Currently, Duke Energy’s residential customers in North Carolina use just over 40% of all the power the company purchases, rather than generates itself, and they pay for about 41% of the costs. An analysis by EQ Research found that under S. 266 residential customers would continue to use the same 40% of purchased power but would bear almost 49% of the costs. This cost shift to smaller-load users is being considered as a growing number of power-hungry data centers are eying North Carolina for expansion.

Source: EQ Research
Another analysis released this week by BW Research found that S. 266 would also lead to a loss of over 50,000 jobs and $1.5 billion in unrealized state tax revenue due to a decline in power sector investments, and to a state energy capacity shortfall of as much as 12 gigawatts. The analysis used modeling by the North Carolina Public Staff, which advocates for customers’ interests at the state Utilities Commission.
S. 266 was introduced by former state Sen. Paul Newton, who retired from his job as Duke Energy’s North Carolina president in 2015. He claimed the bill would save the utility’s North Carolina customers $13 billion but did not release the analysis or explain how the figure was calculated. In response, a trio of North Carolina State University professors specializing in utility economics conducted their own analysis of the proposal and found it could potentially raise customers’ bills by $23 billion by 2050 due to volatility in the price of methane gas, upon which Duke Energy is becoming increasingly dependent.
Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, vetoed S. 266 earlier this month. He said the bill’s climate provision was “sending the wrong signal to businesses that want to be a part of our clean energy economy,” while the cost-shift section meant “families will pay more so that industry pays less.”
Legislators may vote to override the veto as early as July 29 when the Senate and House reconvene.  The House passed S. 266 by a final vote of 75-36 and the Senate by a vote of 29-11. Overriding a governor’s veto requires a three-fifths supermajority of lawmakers present at the time the vote is called, so the margin needed can vary. Assuming full attendance, Republicans hold a supermajority in the Senate, but House Republicans have only 71 members – one short of a supermajority.
Industrial interests tied to the mailers
Constituents of some of the Democrats who voted with Republicans on S. 266 have received mailers from an obscure nonprofit about the upcoming override vote that repeats challenged claims about cost savings to customers and asks recipients to call and thank their representative for supporting it.
The Energy and Policy Institute obtained a copy of the mailer targeting state Rep. Ray Jeffers, a Democrat who voted for S. 266. He represents parts of Durham County and Person County, where Duke Energy is among the largest employers and taxpayers.
The text on the mailer says it was paid for by Citizens for NC Jobs, a nonprofit that registered with the state in January 2025 and launched a Facebook page on March 13, three days after the legislation was initially introduced as S. 261. Newton, the former Duke Energy executive, resigned from the Senate to take another job, and the text was cut from his bill and pasted into a stripped-out S. 266 that had been introduced to speed rebuilding in the western part of the state after flooding from Hurricane Helene.
In paperwork filed with the state, Citizens for NC Jobs disclosed its registering entity as “WASLAW” and gave among its addresses that of Ward and Smith, a North Carolina law firm. Ward and Smith practice before the North Carolina Utilities Commission as counsel for two organizations representing the interests of Duke Energy’s large industrial and commercial customers: Carolina Industrial Group for Fair Utility Rates (CIGFUR) and Carolina Utility Customers Association (CUCA). Susan Vick, a lobbyist for the groups, told EPI that her firm merely registered the paperwork for the nonprofit, has had no further contact, and was unaware of the mailers.
Citizens for NC Jobs’ registration paperwork also lists the exact same mailing and principal office address, down to the suite number, as the North Carolina Chamber, the state’s top business lobby. Duke Energy is a top-tier “Pinnacle” member of the NC Chamber, with a seat on its strategic board. Last year, Duke’s state president Kendal Bowman co-chaired a Chamber fundraising campaign. The NC Chamber did not respond to EPI’s request for comment.
The NC Chamber has lobbied legislators to support S. 266. In an email obtained by EPI, NC Chamber lobbyist Alyssa Morrissey accused Gov. Stein’s veto statement of “cherry pick[ing]” data on the bill’s cost. In lobbying materials reviewed by EPI, the NC Chamber dismissed the N.C. State analysis as a “scare tactic” and urged a vote to override Stein’s veto. In another email obtained by EPI, Morrissey told lawmakers this week that utilities have addressed the methane gas price volatility issue, arguing that they have “various mitigation strategies” to manage it. However, an analysis conducted last year by EQ Research for the Environmental Defense Fund showed that since 2017 methane gas has been the primary driver behind rising Duke Energy electric bills in North Carolina.
The vote to override Stein’s veto of S. 266 will take place in a legislature awash with Duke Energy and other industry money. Over the past decade, Duke Energy has contributed over $2.5 million to North Carolina politics; among its top recipients were Newton’s campaign as well as that of state Sen. Dan Blue, one of the Democrats who voted for S. 266. Over the same period, the NC Chamber has contributed over $438,000 to North Carolina politics, and Newton and Blue were also among its top beneficiaries. On Aug. 13, Blue will be among the featured speakers at a Citizens for NC Jobs conference in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, along with U.S. Rep. Tim Moore, state Senate leader Phil Berger, and state House Speaker Destin Hall, all Republicans.

(AP Photo/Olga Fedorova)All modern U.S. presidents, both Republican and Democratic, have attempted to reduce the population of millions of undocumented immigrants. But their various strategies have not had significant results, with the population hovering around 11 million from 2005 to 2022.
President Donald Trump seeks to change that.
With harsh rhetoric that has sowed fear in immigrant communities, and policies that ignore immigrants’ due process rights, Trump has pursued deportation tactics that differ dramatically from those of any other modern U.S. president.
As a scholar who examines the history of U.S. immigration law and enforcement, I believe that it remains far from clear whether the Trump White House will significantly reduce the undocumented population. But even if the administration’s efforts fail, the fear and damage to the U.S. immigrant community will remain.
 
Presidents Bush and Obama
To increase deportations, in 2006 President George W. Bush began using workplace raids. Among these sweeps was the then-largest immigration workplace operation in U.S. history at a meat processing plant in Postville, Iowa in 2008.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement deployed 900 agents in Postville and arrested 398 employees, 98% of whom were Latino. They were chained together and arraigned in groups of 10 for felony criminal charges of aggravated identity theft, document fraud and use of stolen Social Security numbers. Some 300 were convicted, and 297 of them served jail sentences before being deported.
In 2008, Bush also initiated Secure Communities, a policy that sought to deport noncitizens — both lawful permanent residents as well as undocumented immigrants — who had been arrested for crimes. Some 2 million immigrants were deported during Bush’s two terms in office.
The Obama administration limited Secure Communities to focus on the removal of noncitizens convicted of felonies. It deported a record 400,000 noncitizens in fiscal year 2013, which led detractors to refer to President Barack Obama as the “Deporter in Chief.”
Obama also targeted recent entrants and national security threats and pursued criminal prosecutions for illegal reentry to the U.S. Almost all of these policies built on Bush’s, although Obama virtually abandoned workplace raids.
Despite these enforcement measures, Obama also initiated Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, in 2012. The policy provided relief from deportation and gave work authorization to more than 500,000 undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children.
Obama deported about 3 million noncitizens, but the size of the undocumented population did not decrease dramatically.
 
The first Trump administration and Biden
Trump’s first administration broke new immigration enforcement ground in several ways.
He began his presidency by issuing what was called a “Muslim ban” to restrict the entry into the U.S. of noncitizens from predominantly Muslim nations.
Early in Trump’s first administration, federal agents expanded immigration operations to include raids at courthouses, which previously had been off-limits.
In 2017, Trump tried to rescind DACA, but the Supreme Court rejected those efforts in 2020.
In 2019, Trump implemented the Remain in Mexico policy that for the first time forced noncitizens who came to the U.S. border seeking asylum to wait in Mexico while their claims were being decided. He also invoked Title 42 in 2020 to close U.S. borders during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Trump succeeded in reducing legal immigration numbers during his first term. However, there is no evidence that his enforcement policies reduced the size of the overall undocumented population.
President Joe Biden sought to relax — although not abandon — some immigration enforcement measures implemented during Trump’s first term.
His administration slowed construction of the border wall championed by Trump. Biden also stopped workplace raids in 2021, and in 2023, he ended Title 42.
In 2023, Biden sought to respond to migration surges in a measured fashion, by temporarily closing ports of entry and increasing arrests.
In attempting to enforce the borders, his administration at times pursued tough measures. Biden continued deportation efforts directed at criminal noncitizens. Immigrant rights groups criticized his administration when armed Border Patrol officers on horseback were videotaped chasing Haitian migrants on the U.S.-Mexico border.
As of 2022, the middle of the Biden’s term, an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants lived in the U.S.
 
A second chance
Since his second inauguration, Trump has pursued a mass deportation campaign through executive orders unprecedented in their scope.
In January 2025, he announced an expanded, expedited removal process for any noncitizen apprehended anywhere in the country — not just the border region, as had been U.S. practice since 1996.
In March, Trump issued a presidential proclamation to deport Venezuelan nationals who were members of the Tren de Aragua gang, designated a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department. In doing so, he invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 — an act used three times in U.S. history during declared wars that empowers presidents to remove foreign nationals from countries at war with the U.S.
Declaring an “invasion” of migrants into the U.S. in June, Trump deployed the military to assist in immigration enforcement in Los Angeles.
Trump also sought to dramatically upend birthright citizenship, the Constitutional provision that guarantees citizenship to any person born in the U.S. He issued an executive order in January that would bar citizenship to people born in the U.S. to undocumented parents.
The birthright executive order has been challenged in federal court and is mostly likely working its way up to the Supreme Court.
Under the second Trump administration, immigration arrests are up, but actual deportation numbers are in flux.
ICE in June arrested the most people in a month in at least five years, roughly 30,000 immigrants. But deportations of noncitizens — roughly 18,000 — lagged behind those during the Obama administration’s record-setting year of 2013, in which more than 400,000 noncitizens were deported.
The gap between arrests and deportations shows the challenges the Trump administration faces in making good on his promised mass deportation campaign.
Undocumented immigrants often come to the U.S. to work or seek safety from natural disasters and mass violence.
These issues have not been seriously addressed by any modern U.S. president. Until it is, we can expect the undocumented population to remain in the millions.

Michael Gordon is one of three Department of Justice (DOJ) employees who filed a lawsuit on Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. All three previously worked on the prosecution of January 6th defendants, indicating that their terminations were “retaliations for prosecutions that were perceived as politically affiliated,” according to the lawsuit.
Gordon says he was conducting a virtual witness preparation interview for an upcoming criminal trial on June 27 when an administrative officer asked him to pause the call as he was handed a one-page document signed by Bondi informing him that he was being removed from his position as an Assistant U.S. Attorney “effective immediately,” with no justification given to why he was being fired.
The heart of the lawsuit filed by Gordon and his two DOJ colleagues – Patricia Hartman and Joseph Tirrell – is that Bondi disregarded long-standing protections that govern how and when members of the civil service can be terminated.
“The laws on the books are crystal clear about the procedures that have to be followed to fire federal employees who are protected by them,” Gordon said while speaking to this reporter on WMNF 88.5 FM on Friday. “Crystal clear. It’s not a gray area. And here, the DOJ has just completely ignored the law.”
 Retribution

The Trump administration hasn’t been subtle about trying to remove anyone in the federal government who has been involved in investigations stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. 
ABC News reported in late January that the DOJ asked for information about potentially “thousands” of FBI employees across the country who were involved in that investigation, and they have subsequently fired dozens of career prosecutors during the past six months, the Washington Post reported last week.
Gordon says that morale in his office “is in a bad place right now” with DOJ employees around the country asking, “am I next?”
He says they’re asking questions that Americans shouldn’t want federal prosecutors to answer, such as: “The facts and the law say that I should charge this case, but is this going to be something the president wants? Am I going to be fired for this down the line?”
 Mike Gordon v. the United States

“I have been a professional fighter on behalf of the government for my whole legal career,” he says. “Now I’m on the other side of it. I’m fighting against the government. I have been standing up in court for eight-and-a-half years and I start by saying, ’Your honor, Mike Gordon for the United States.’ Now my name is on a federal lawsuit, where it’s Mike Gordon v. the United States. Which is a bizarre place to be.”
Gordon began working in the Middle District of Florida in January of 2017. He worked in the violent crime and narcotics section but volunteered to prosecute January 6 rioters after he watched the attack on the Capitol that day from his home office in Tampa. 
He ended up as a senior trial counsel in the Capitol Siege Section of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Washington, prosecuting some of the more recognizable defendants, such as Richard Barnett, the man who was seen putting his feet up on a desk in the office of then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Ray Epps, who became a target of conspiracy theorists that he was an undercover agent who helped instigate the uprising. 
At the time of his termination, Gordon was counsel of record in 17 cases for the Middle District of Florida, had 20 ongoing investigations, and was slated to have at least six trials between now and September, the legal filing says.
During the 2024 campaign, Trump said if elected he would grant clemency to at least some of his supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, which Gordon said he expected would happen if Trump were re-elected.

But Gordon says he was absolutely “shocked” when Trump commuted the sentences of some individuals convicted of events on that day and granted a full and unconditional pardon to more than 1,000 others who were charged in the attack on the U.S. Capitol.
“As much as Donald Trump had campaigned on many issues, one of the things that he had done is he had hugged law enforcement,” he says. “He said that he ‘backed the blue,’ that he was a big supporter of law enforcement. So I never thought that he would pardon people who were either convicted of ,or pled guilty to, assaulting law enforcement officers. And I thought that not just because it was morally and ethically wrong to do that, but also because I thought that would politically inflame his base.”
He’s never met Bondi
Gordon says he’s never met Bondi even though prior to her appointment as AG they both lived in Tampa and have a lot of mutual acquaintances in the legal world.
“This is my speculation, but I suspect she has no idea who I am,” he says. “She might now given the news. I think someone else identified me somehow for political revenge or political retribution, put my name in a letter, put it on her desk, and she probably signed it.”
Gordon says he intends to use the public attention focused on him right now to voice his concerns about what’s happening with the justice system  under the Trump administration.
“The Trump administration is walking around the house, dousing it with gasoline and playing with matches in the corner,” he says. “And we all have to stand up and shout from the rooftops before that match gets lit and the house goes up in flames.”

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)A mistake by a state emergency operations center worker inadvertently sent emergency alert test messages to cellphones across Alaska on Wednesday afternoon.
Mark Roberts, head of the emergency operations center, said the error occurred when a worker was conducting a regular weekly test of the Emergency Alert System, which broadcasts disaster warnings by radio and TV.
“When our operator went to select that test, they inadvertently selected the wireless emergency alert test as well,” he said.
The Wireless Emergency Alert system, mandated by the federal government, distributes emergency messages to every cellphone in an area specified by emergency managers.



How do I enable warning messages on my phone?
All new cellphones come with emergency alerts enabled by default. Test messages are not enabled.
To enable test messages or to double-check that emergency alerts are active on your phone, search for “government alerts” or “emergency alerts” in your cellphone’s settings.
On an iPhone, they can be found under Settings > Notifications > Government Alerts. Many Android phones have the setting under “state and local tests.”



Unlike a notorious 2018 incident in Hawaii, when a test failure caused a statewide missile attack alert, Alaska’s Wednesday alert was clearly identified as a test and was distributed only to Alaskans who have manually enabled test alerts in their cellphone settings.
“This was not a live alert, so it didn’t go out to everybody,” he said. “They come, by default, not enabled … so mainly the folks that got it were emergency managers we work with within the state.”
Though inadvertent, the alert was a successful test of state officials’ ability to trigger the Wireless Emergency Alert network.
A nationwide test took place in October 2023, and emergency officials issued a statewide Amber Alert to cellphones in June 2023, but until Wednesday, there had been no statewide alerts since then. 
Some alerts have gone out locally. Earlier this month, tsunami warning messages were thrown to cellphones in Anchorage and along the coast after a major earthquake near Sand Point.
No impactful tsunami resulted from that incident, but in other states, the use of local cellphone alerts has saved lives. In some cases, failures to issue an alert may have cost them.
Earlier this month, more than 130 people died in Texas amid widespread flash flooding. Officials there failed to use the federal cellphone warning system, which likely contributed to the death toll. 
In California and Hawaii, Wireless Emergency Alert messages about deadly wildfires also failed to reach people in time.
In the City and Borough of Juneau, officials are preparing for what’s known as a jökulhlaup — a glacial outburst flood — of the kind that inundated parts of the city last year. 
A new flood is expected in early August, and though local officials have since constructed flood barriers, they’re also preparing for another disaster.
At 3:30 p.m. Thursday, the city successfully tested a local emergency message sent through the Wireless Emergency Alert network to phones in the area.
Additional disaster preparation is already underway in the city, with organizations scheduled to fill and distribute sandbags this weekend.

(Photo provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)This July marked 80 years since the U.S. government detonated the first atomic bomb in the desert of southern New Mexico, marking the start of the nuclear age — and an ongoing nightmare for the people who call the area home.

Compensation program for health damage from Alaska weapons tests is extended

	That test, known as Trinity, blanketed rural communities in radioactive fallout. No one was warned. No one was evacuated. Families drank radioactive rainwater, breathed in ash, and were left to carry the burden in silence.
Now, for the first time in history, those communities will finally be acknowledged.
Earlier versions of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), originally passed in 1990, offered compensation to “downwinders” impacted by nuclear testing in Nevada and to others who’d worked as uranium miners before 1971. But New Mexicans and other long suffering communities were left out.
But now that law, which expired last year, has been renewed and expanded to include New Mexico’s Trinity downwinders, post-1971 uranium mine workers, and other affected communities in Missouri, Tennessee, Alaska, Kentucky, and beyond.
But this long-overdue justice comes with a gut punch: the RECA expansion is buried inside Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” the GOP budget that slashes Medicaid, SNAP, and rural health care — lifelines for the very people this bill claims to protect — to finance tax cuts for the wealthy.
This is not justice.
I come from generations of Nuevomexicanos who’ve lived and worked on these lands for decades. Both of my grandparents have battled cancer. And while we may never get a clear answer, we can’t help but wonder if it was because of exposure to the radioactive legacy that’s haunted New Mexico for generations.
These aren’t isolated stories. They’re echoed across our pueblos, acequias, and towns. From the Navajo Nation, where uranium miners were sent underground without protection, to the 1979 Church Rock disaster — the worst nuclear spill in U.S. history — our communities have borne the brunt of nuclear colonialism while being erased from the story.
When RECA was passed in 1990, it excluded us. Even as cancers and birth defects multiplied, even as we buried our elders and our children, we were told our suffering didn’t count. When the program expired in 2024, it slammed the door shut on new claims.
Now, with a revival of RECA on the table, it’s a historic moment. But the same bill that expands RECA also threatens to strip millions of people of their basic health care.
I crunched the numbers in a new fact sheet for the Institute for Policy Studies.
In the 16 RECA-eligible states alone, I found that this bill will rip health insurance away from over 3.9 million people — including 103,719 in New Mexico, the very state whose residents were sacrificed to build the U.S. nuclear empire.
The total figure includes over 1.4 million people losing Medicaid coverage and another 2.5 million losing Affordable Care Act coverage. On top of that, a total of 240 rural hospitals in these states are considered at risk of closing.
These are not just numbers — they are lives. Aging uranium miners. Downwinders living in remote, medically underserved areas. Elders in rural towns who have no alternative when their hospital closes.
This bill gives with one hand and takes away with the other. That’s not justice — it’s policy murder.
I welcome the long-overdue recognition of downwinders from New Mexico and other impacted communities in RECA. But what does that mean if those same people are losing access to health care? Many rely on Medicaid and rural hospitals. If those lifelines vanish, how will they get diagnosed, let alone treated?
Even this “win” is short-lived: RECA would only be extended until the end of 2028, far too little time to reach, enroll, and support impacted communities.
Justice must come with real care. We shouldn’t have to trade one harm for another. We deserve compensation without compromise. RECA should be expanded for longer — without compromising Medicaid or rural health care.
We demand justice without sacrifice.

Vermont Green Football Club prevailed in the United Soccer League’s second-tier Eastern Conference finals at the University of Vermont’s Virtue Field on Friday evening, further extending the best season in club history.
The team defeated Virginia-based Lionsbridge Football Club 3-1 in overtime. Vermont Green will  play Alabama-based Dothan United in the league’s national semifinals on Sunday at 6:30 p.m., retaining the home advantage at Virtue Field.
Excitement has been building steadily this season around the Green’s success. Friday’s game sold out in under 30 seconds, the hosts said, and tickets for last Sunday’s 3-2 home playoff win over FC Motown were also gone within a few minutes.
The atmosphere at Vermont Green’s Burlington games has become an attraction in itself, with capacity crowds overflowing onto the unticketed hill overlooking the field. The team’s fan group, the Green Mountain Bhoys, drive high-energy crowds in chants, cheers and choreography. Long lines build at the stands of local vendors — Ben and Jerry’s, Shacksbury Cider, and others.
Since the club’s founding in 2022, the club has garnered national attention for its socially conscious, locally focused approach to soccer, especially in relation to environmental justice. 
The club has also become more successful on the pitch, recruiting top college players from around the world, including from the UVM team which won the NCAA national title in December.
The 2025 season has been the club’s highest-achieving by far, with a 16-match undefeated record, a first-place finish in the northeast division, and an ongoing deep run into the playoffs. In 2024, the Green placed third in its division and won two playoff matches, but were ultimately knocked out by the nationally top-ranked Seacoast United of New Hampshire.

(Photovs iStock/Getty Images)Starting next month, Louisiana residents will be allowed to have darker tint on the front side windows of their vehicles than has been allowed in decades. 

Louisiana lawmakers overwhelmingly voted to reduce the amount of light that tinted front side windows allow inside a vehicle from 40% to 25% through Act 143, sponsored by Rep. Daryl Deshotel, R-Marksville. 
The 25% light transmission level is already allowed on rear side windows, and 12% is allowed on back windows. No tint is not allowed on most of the front windshield. 

Deshotel said earlier this year he brought the bill because his daughter was taking medication that made her sensitive to sunlight, and he wanted to put a darker tint on her vehicle windows. 
Current state law allows for an exemption to tint restrictions for medical conditions, which require a written explanation and diagnosis from a medical doctor or optometrist. A vehicle owner must also get Louisiana State Police approval for the exception and place a special decal on their car. 

Restrictions on window tints have typically been put in place at the request of law enforcement groups, which worry that dark windows can make officers vulnerable when they approach drivers and passengers. 

Deshotel’s legislation only garnered tepid opposition from public safety organizations. 
Kevin Hayes, a lobbyist for the Louisiana Association of Chiefs of Police, submitted written opposition to the bill when it first came up for a hearing in the Louisiana House of Representatives. But he did not push back against the proposal when it moved to the Senate for its final votes. 

The Louisiana Sheriffs Association didn’t oppose the legislation. 

States surrounding Louisiana have similar tint restrictions on front side windows to the one taking effect next week. The allowed tint is 25% in Arkansas, 28% in Mississippi and 25% in Texas, according to Rayno Window Film, a tinting company.  
A person driving a vehicle that violates the state’s current or future window tinting restrictions can face a $150 fine for a first offense and a $350 fine for a third or subsequent offense.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Adam Crum, commissioner of the Alaska Department of Revenue, will leave his job Aug. 8, according to an announcement published Friday by Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s office.
A person familiar with Crum’s plans said he intends to run for governor in 2026, joining seven other Republican candidates. No independents or Democrats have filed for the primary election, which is 13 months away. 
Asked whether he will run for governor, Crum said by text message, “I’ve accomplished a lot to put Alaska on sound economic footing. I’ll have a formal statement on my last day, August 8th. Stay tuned.”
Crum has been part of Dunleavy’s cabinet since the governor took office in 2018. He initially served as commissioner of the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services, occupying that position during the COVID-19 pandemic and during an executive order that split the agency into two separate departments.
In 2022, Dunleavy named Crum as revenue commissioner, and he assumed a seat on the board of the Alaska Permanent Fund Corp., whose revenues are the No. 1 source of general-purpose dollars for state services and the Permanent Fund dividend.
Jason Brune, former commissioner of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, now fills a public seat on the Permanent Fund Corp. board.
Brune said he knows Crum has been considering a run for governor but could not confirm his plans.
“His departure is a big loss for the state,” Brune said by text. 
“It was an honor working with him for the five years we served together,” he said, referring to the time they spent on the Dunleavy cabinet.
In a written statement Dunleavy praised Crum’s performance during his time with the state.
“Commissioner Crum has been an exemplary leader whose unwavering dedication and innovative approach have significantly benefited Alaskans,” Dunleavy said. “During his time leading both the Department of Health and Social Services and the Department of Revenue, Adam consistently prioritized Alaska’s economic well-being, public health, and fiscal stability. His collaborative spirit and commitment to serving our communities have made a lasting, positive impact.”
The governor’s office said an acting commissioner will be named soon.

(NPS / Jacob W. Frank)Members of Montana’s congressional delegation have introduced bicameral legislation implementing a presidential order that will charge international visitors to America’s national parks an additional fee.
The state’s western congressional Rep. Ryan Zinke, a former Interior Secretary during President Donald Trump’s first term, along with junior U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy, introduced the Protecting America’s Treasures by Raising Inflow from Overseas Tourists in Parks Act (PATRIOT Parks Act), which could address maintenance backlogs at some of the country’s most popular sites.
“National Parks are Americas best idea and maintaining that legacy for future generations means making smart investments in the management of the parks,” Zinke said in a press release. “Americans already pay for parks in our tax dollars as well as at the gates. It’s unfair to American taxpayers to foot the bill for millions of foreign visitors. Almost every other country charges foreign visitors more, it’s common sense. President Trump and Secretary Burgum did the right thing directing the National Park Service implement a foreign visitor fee. This legislation will codify the policy and ensure Americans are put First in our own parks.”
The idea to raise additional funds from foreign tourists has long been championed by the Property and Environment Research Center, a Bozeman-based a “free market environmentalism” nonprofit think-tank. Sheehy once served on its board.
In preliminary Interior budget documents for the 2026 fiscal year released this spring, the federal government proposed a new fee on foreign visitors to address some of the shortfall in National Park Service budgets, but simultaneously showed an agency request of just $2.1 billion, roughly two-thirds of the NPS budget in 2025.
However, the latest version of the Interior appropriations bill, which passed through committee this week, showed a budget recommendation $3.1 billion — roughly holding current funding levels intact.
Last year was the busiest on record for the NPS, with more than 331 million visitors spending time at the 433 NPS units, including historic sites, battlefields and monuments, in addition to the 63 national parks.
The increased traffic at the nation’s crown jewels have added to a deferred maintenance backlog of nearly $23 billion to maintain roads, buildings, utility systems and other facilities across the park system.
According to researchers with PERC, because roughly 80% of entrance fees charged by some NPS sites are retained at the site they are collected, increasing gate revenue could help address specific maintenance backlogs at heavily trafficked sites.
In a study using NPS data showing baseline entry fee revenue of $349 million, PERC calculated a $16, $25 and $40 surcharge for foreign visitors, with an estimate that the surcharge would correspond with a roughly 3% decrease in visitation.
The smallest surcharge would generate an additional $211 million annually, while the highest would bring in $528 million — more than doubling the current revenue.
“The current system is relatively blunt — there are lots of margins you can refine in a logical way,” Watkins said. “That’s where I think you can see big changes happen.”
Early versions of the federal directive to increase fees on foreign visitors cited an additional $90 million in fees, but neither Trump’s executive order, the latest appropriations documents, nor the newly introduced legislation have specific dollar amounts set as revenue goals.
The PATRIOT Parks Act was co-introduced in the respective chambers with Rep. Riley Moore, R-West Virginia, and Sen. Jim Banks, R-Indiana.
“Our national parks drive Montana’s tourism economy by bringing in visitors from all over the world and define our way life by offering an experience you can only find in America,” Sheehy said in a statement. “Implementing a foreign visitor fee is an America First, commonsense way to secure affordable access for American families, improve our national parks for all visitors, and better manage our treasured public lands. It’s not too much for Americans to ask that their government puts them first, and that’s why I’m proud to support the PATRIOT Parks Act so more American families can enjoy our national parks for generations to come.”
Officials who have spoken about the proposed fee changes cite other parts of the world where foreign tourists are charged more than locals. The Galapagos Islands are commonly referenced, where foreign tourists pay $200, while Ecuadorian adults pay just $30.
“It is the policy of my Administration to preserve these opportunities for American families in future generations by increasing entry fees for foreign tourists, improving affordability for United States residents, and expanding opportunities to enjoy America’s splendid national treasures,” Trumps executive order stated.
The foreign surcharge, as defined in the PATRIOT Parks Act, would only apply to NPS sites that already charge entrance fees, and exempt monuments in Washington D.C.

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)A panel of Idaho legislators is looking to do one of the first major state government reorganizations since the 1970s, with the primary goal of reducing its size and improving efficiency. 
The Idaho Legislature’s DOGE Task Force — named for the federal Department of Government Efficiency that was previously led by billionaire Elon Musk before he left his role in May — met for the first time Friday afternoon at the Idaho State Capitol. The committee was inspired by Idaho’s House Bill 364, which passed the House in the 2025 legislative session but stalled in the Senate.

Committee co-chair Rep. Jeff Ehlers, R-Meridian, said the committee’s directive is to look into three primary focus areas: examine all departments and divisions for reduction, consolidation or elimination; eliminate unnecessary employee positions; and evaluate state travel. 
“There’s a lot to look at,” Ehlers said. “So we intend to do a lot in this interim, with the goal to really have some legislation and policy brought forth from this committee that we can implement in the next legislative session.” 
Ehlers also said the committee would take public input on existing inefficiencies and potential solutions in an online portal at legislature.idaho.gov/doge. 
Although the DOGE bill died during the Idaho legislative session, Idaho GOP legislative leaders announced the creation of the task force in April. Ehlers told the Idaho Capital Sun on Friday that legislative leaders have “broad authority” to create interim committees that meet outside of the approximately three-month legislative session.

  In 1970, Idaho constitutional amendment consolidated state government programs

Committee members on Friday heard staff overviews of existing state agencies and programs, and Transparent Idaho, a website that tracks state spending. 
Jared Tatro, who leads the Legislative Services Office Impact Review team, said that in 1970 the state passed a constitutional amendment to consolidate government programs into no more than 20 executive branch departments, excluding the offices of Idaho’s seven constitutional officers. 
This change was made by the Legislature and approved by the voters to make  it easier for people to access their government and to know where to go, Tatro said. 
Within each of the departments, there are many sub-units. For instance, within the Office of the Governor there are many other organizations, such as the Idaho Commission for the Blind or the Office of Drug Policy. 
Some state agencies, such as the State Board of Education, are set forth in the state Constitution, Tatro said. 
 In Arkansas, 2019 bill consolidated agencies. But savings weren’t tracked, official says

Lawmakers also heard from an Arkansas official, Amy Fecher, about her state’s more than two-year process to reorganize and consolidate its government. She helped lead the Arkansas Transformation Advisory Board, which worked with the Arkansas Legislature to pass a more than 2,000-page bill in 2019 that set up a framework for the reorganization to take the 42 cabinet-level agencies down to 15. 
“We asked the secretaries to evaluate their new departments and to make recommendations on things such as the fleet, the real estate, their staffing and other issues,” Fecher said.
She told lawmakers the cost savings from the changes weren’t able to be tracked. The state operates on a two-year budget, she said, so the officials operated within those previously set budgets. 
Several members of the public spoke in support of the task force’s mission. One speaker, Serge Brown, expressed skepticism at whether the group would “solve problems or simply recycle them.” 
Idaho Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, told Brown that lawmakers have limited time during the legislative session, and that the interim committee will allow them to “dig deeper.” 
“I would encourage you to be patient with us and let the system work,” Scott said, “and I truly believe you’re going to see some big things out of the committee.” 
Ehlers told the Sun he hopes the committee will meet monthly and have legislation ready to recommend for the 2026 Idaho legislative session.

Shelley Hughes has become the seventh Republican to announce a run for governor in next year’s election. Incumbent Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Republican, is term-limited and cannot seek reelection in 2026. 
With an announcement at Palmer’s Rebarchek Park on Thursday night, Hughes said that as governor, she would focus on energy costs and eliminating the state’s “brain drain” and its “brawn drain.”
“We need those people that can do the kinds of jobs, the resource-development kinds of jobs, that don’t take a master’s degree. And we also need the educated for certain positions, and we’re losing young people,” she said. 
Hughes, a conservative member of the Senate’s all-Republican minority caucus, was elected to the Senate in 2016 after two terms in the state House. She served as a majority leader for two years before the current bipartisan majority took control in 2023.
“I think the good Lord gave me the gift of being able to build consensus without forsaking my values and my principles,” she said during her announcement speech, “and so that is a skill set that is very, very important for a governor to have, because you’re not always going to be given the Legislature that you would maybe hand-pick yourself. You have to play the cards you’re dealt, right?”
Hughes joins an already-crowded field of Republicans seeking to succeed Dunleavy in office.
As of Friday, the six other Republican candidates included:

Lieutenant Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom
Former Fairbanks state Sen. Click Bishop
Longtime Republican campaigner and business owner Bernadette Wilson
Matanuska-Susitna Borough Mayor Edna DeVries
Anchorage podiatrist Matt Heilala
Angoon resident James Parkin

At least two other Republicans — revenue commissioner Adam Crum and attorney general Treg Taylor — may also enter the race. On Friday, Crum announced his resignation from state service, effective Aug. 8, and Taylor has been holding a series of public events similar to those conducted by prior prospective candidates.
Hughes’ decision to run for governor means there is no incumbent running in next year’s election for the Senate seat she occupies. No candidates have filed to run for that seat, which is in a district that has solidly voted Republican in recent years.
By text message after her announcement, Hughes said she doesn’t know if she will resign from her seat early, as current Gov. Mike Dunleavy did when he was a member of the Senate and ran for governor in 2018.
“That is a decision I will make later in the year, but it is a real possibility,” she said.
If Hughes were to resign, a replacement would be appointed by Dunleavy to fill the remainder of the term. That replacement would have to be confirmed by the Senate’s other 10 Republicans, said Scott Kendall, the Anchorage attorney who wrote the relevant law.
Five of those Republicans are members of the Senate’s bipartisan majority caucus; the other five are in the Senate’s all-Republican minority caucus. 
In a town hall meeting on July 3, Alaska Democratic Party chairman Eric Croft was asked when Democrats would begin filing for statewide elections, including the governor’s race, U.S. House and U.S. Senate. No Democrats have yet filed for any of those races.
“I think there’s a lot of those discussions going on,” he said. “There’s people interested. A lot of people (are) interested in what Mary Peltola does. I know people want it done right now, but it’s still a year and a half away, so I think (we need) a little bit of patience on that, but I understand the frustration.”
Sen. Scott Kawasaki, D-Fairbanks, said the national Senate Democratic Campaign Committee and its House counterpart “are trying to make sure that we’ve got a strong field of folks who want to run.”
Asked Friday whether anything has changed since that town hall meeting, Croft said by email that Alaskans deserve better than what they currently have in Congress and the governor’s office, and that he is confident that the party will have a strong candidate on the ballot next year.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Oklahoma’s House Speaker urged State Superintendent Ryan Walters on Friday to “turn over all relevant devices” and cooperate with an investigation after two board members reported that they saw naked women on his television screen.
The Oklahoman and NonDoc reported late Friday that board members Ryan Deatherage and Becky Carson said they saw the pictures on a television in Walters’ office during a State Board of Education executive session that was held the July 24.
“These are serious allegations made by two members of the State Board and an expeditious third-party review is warranted,” Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said in a statement. “I urge the State Superintendent to unlock and turn over all relevant devices and fully cooperate with an investigation.
“If no wrongdoing occurred, a prompt and transparent review should quickly clear his name.”
A spokesperson for Hilbert said he isn’t interested in determining who would investigate, but believes a probe is needed.
Walters and an agency spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Oklahoma Voice.
Earlier in the day, the agency told NonDoc that the accusations were “a junk tabloid lie,” and said that Walters was facing a “hostile board who will say and do anything except tell the truth.”
Carson could not be reached for comment Friday afternoon. 
Deatherage declined a request for an interview, but said in a text message that it is his top priority to protect students.
“We hold educators to the strictest of standards when it comes to explicit material,” Deatherage said. “The standard for the superintendent should be no different.”
The two board members were recently confirmed by the Senate. Deatherage was appointed by Gov. Kevin Stitt during a board restructuring that replaced three board members following what Stitt called “needless political drama.” Carson was appointed to fill a vacant position.
The board has questioned Walters’ actions and his authority in recent months. On Thursday, board members questioned Walters over his authority to require districts to provide free school lunches to all students, a controversial test he wants to require California and New York teachers to take before they can become certified to teach in Oklahoma, and a new partnership with a private, online Arizona-based school. The board wanted to know why they weren’t consulted.
Carson also publicly questioned Walters about why he didn’t provide them with a copy of a resignation letter that was addressed to both the board and Walters. 
Walters has been a vocal critic of pornography and sought to ban some books that he said contained it from school library shelves.

(Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)More than 63 million Americans are caregivers for a family member with complex medical needs, a 20 million increase over the past decade, according to a new report.
But state policies, workplaces and the American health system haven’t kept up with this surge in family caregiving responsibilities, said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, a physician and the CEO of the AARP, which released the report with the National Alliance for Caregiving, a nonprofit policy and research organization.
“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.
‘A purpose in this world’: Older adults fear elimination of program that helps them find work

The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, and also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers; Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before. And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.
Meanwhile, the historic cuts to Medicaid enacted as part of the GOP’s Big, Beautiful Bill Act will shift health costs to states, leaving experts worried that family caregivers could lose Medicaid-funded services they rely on.

As Texas moves forward with an off-cycle redistricting to shore up Republicans’ narrow House majority, Gov. Gavin Newsom is plotting a Democratic response in California. But the state’s independent redistricting commission is a major obstacle.


What seemed a few weeks ago like a far-fetched political fantasy ahead of the 2026 midterms has quickly evolved into a high-stakes showdown enveloping states across the country.
As Texas this week began an off-cycle redistricting process meant to shore up Republicans’ slim House majority, Gov. Gavin Newsom appeared Friday with a group of Democratic legislators from that state, reaffirming his intention for California to respond with new maps of its own that would benefit Democrats.
Following a meeting with the Texas lawmakers at the historic governor’s mansion in downtown Sacramento, Newsom told reporters that “everything is at stake if we’re not successful next year in taking back the House of Representatives” — not only blunting President Donald Trump’s agenda, but protecting American democracy.
“If we don’t put a stake into the heart of this administration, there may not be an election in 2028,” he said. “They’re not screwing around. We can’t afford to screw around either. We have got to fight fire with fire.”
There’s one major obstacle to the governor’s ambitions, however: While the Legislature draws district lines in Texas, California relies on a bipartisan citizen redistricting commission protected by the state Constitution.
In 2008, voters narrowly approved an amendment removing California legislators’ power to draw their own seats. Two years later, voters overwhelmingly passed another amendment expanding the commission’s authority to congressional maps.
The independent commission in California became a national model for advocates who hoped to end the partisan gerrymandering that has contributed to a decline in competitive House seats and the country’s fractious, sectarian politics.
Now Newsom, who said he otherwise supports independent redistricting, is exploring multiple options for working around the commission to squeeze more Democratic districts out of California, if Texas follows through on its plan.
That would probably involve calling a special election, Newsom said, though he is still discussing with the Legislature what sort of proposal they might present to voters. Would it include a new map to approve or create another process to draw on? Would the commission be temporarily or permanently repealed?
“This is a fluid conversation,” he said. “We’re gaming all those things out.”
Trump turns up the heat in Texas
States typically redraw their congressional seats once per decade, after the census, to ensure the districts are all roughly equal in population. The most recent maps were drawn after the 2020 election and took effect in 2022.
But last month, Trump’s political team began pressuring Republican leaders in Texas to revisit the state’s district lines and create additional GOP seats. The party won a five-seat majority in the House last November, the narrowest in nearly a century, leaving little room for error as Trump tries to enact his legislative agenda and putting control of the chamber at risk if next year’s midterm is a wave election against the unpopular president.
Despite opposition from Republicans in the Texas congressional delegation — who worried that diluting their conservative voter bases in redistricting could inadvertently make their seats vulnerable — Gov. Greg Abbott earlier this month called a special session of the Legislature to redraw the maps. He is targeting four Democratic seats in the Dallas and Houston areas that the Trump administration has deemed “unconstitutional racial gerrymanders” because they have high numbers of Black and Latino voters. The first public hearing took place on Thursday, with Texas Democratic lawmakers slamming the move as a “power grab.”
The boldly political maneuver juiced similar efforts in other Republican states, including Ohio and Missouri, that could further pad a GOP majority, while setting off alarm bells among Democrats nationally.
But even as party leaders voice their outrage, they have fewer options to fight back, because congressional districts in many of the largest Democratic states, such as California, New York and New Jersey, are drawn by independent commissions.
No one has been more outspoken than Newsom, who weeks ago began publicly floating the idea of sidestepping California’s commission to redraw more congressional districts in Democrats’ favor if Texas moves forward with its plan.
But it’s no sure thing in California
It’s a legally dubious and politically fraught endeavor. Even some of Newsom’s fellow Democrats have expressed skepticism because of the precedent it would set, including Assemblymember Alex Lee of Milpitas, whose vote may be needed to place a measure on the ballot. Common Cause California, a nonprofit that advocates for government in the public interest and backed the formation of the independent commission, blasted it as a “dangerous move” that would “put our state’s democracy on the line during a time of national instability.”
Meanwhile, Republican gubernatorial candidate Steve Hilton is already threatening to sue to stop a new map and has added to his platform a plan to require the redistricting commission to include more GOP seats.
Because of the legal risks in having the Legislature simply draw new congressional districts, the most likely route is a special election asking voters to overturn the independent commission, said Paul Mitchell, a Democratic redistricting consultant.
The problem is that the commission remains highly popular with voters in polling, Mitchell said. To get around that, Newsom may need to make concessions, like a temporary pause that resumes the independent redistricting process in 2031, after the next census.
“It’s ‘in emergency, break glass,’ not ‘let’s burn down the whole building,’” Mitchell said.
Even then, he said, Democrats would need to maintain the drumbeat of frustration over how the party is being harmed in Texas for months to turn out a motivated electorate in an unusual special election.
“It’s like lightning in a bottle right now,” Mitchell said. “Are they going to be able to keep this a front-burner issue for people?”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/072525-Gavin-Newsom-Presser-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-25 19:57:06.506565

Photo by Emily Fitzgerald. If state funding for forest health and wildfire prevention isn’t ramped back up in the next legislative session, it could hinder efforts to prevent severe fires in the coming years, Washington’s top public lands official and others warned this week.
The state Legislature approved House Bill 1168 in 2021, which committed $500 million over eight years to the state Department of Natural Resources for wildfire preparedness and response. 
State spending had largely kept up with that target until this year, with the department receiving $115 million in the last two-year budget and $130 million in the one before that.  
Then this year, as lawmakers confronted a budget shortfall, they slashed the wildfire preparedness funding to just $60 million for the next two years. 
The Department of Natural Resources says it’s prepared for this fire season and has money left over from past years. But the funding rollback has sparked concerns. 
Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove raised the alarm this week during a press conference near the Burdoin Fire in the Columbia River Gorge. 
As of Friday, that fire had burned 11,269 acres on both sides of Highway 14 east of White Salmon and was just 13% contained. The blaze had also led to the closure of Highway 14 and other roads, and evacuation orders for hundreds of residents.
“If next year’s supplemental budget does not restore some of that funding, we’re going to see more fires like this, they’re going to be larger, and they’re going to cost the taxpayers a lot more money in the back end,” Upthegrove said during a press conference with Gov. Bob Ferguson.
Ferguson stopped short of calling for the funding to be boosted, but thanked the Legislature for the funds it did provide. 
“This is a reminder of the need for those resources … they’re truly making a big difference right now as we understand it from the experts here on the ground,” Ferguson said. 
The Department of Natural Resources has worked since receiving the dedicated wildfire preparedness funding in 2021 to thin out flammable vegetation in forests around the state.
But there’s plenty more to be done, both for fire mitigation and fire recovery, and the reduced funding is “not going to allow us to do as much work as we normally do,” said Collin Haffey, post-fire recovery program manager for the department. 
Haffey spoke during a tour of the Rimrock Retreat Fire area in the Yakima Valley this week. The fire burned roughly 46,600 acres over a month last year, between Rimrock Lake and Tieton in the Yakima Valley, after starting at a cabin.
The visit highlighted the department’s post-fire recovery efforts, as well as the pre-fire actions that officials say helped to significantly reduce the harm the fire caused the local ecosystem and surrounding community. 
While the fire burned severely in some areas, the damage wasn’t as bad in the Oak Creek drainage due to forest management actions the Department of Natural Resources took before the fire, officials said. 
Using House Bill 1168 funding, the Department of Natural Resources thinned trees and conducted prescribed burns in that area.
The goal with this kind of work is to restore a historically natural mix of clearings and densely forested areas, creating what forest scientists call a mosaic pattern. This can reduce the risk of high-intensity fires while also better supporting biodiversity than forests that get too dense. 
And when wildfires do burn on land that’s been treated in this way, it can be beneficial rather than catastrophic.
“This fire in the Oak Creek drainage, in terms of the impacts on forests and on wildlife overall, was good,” said Derek Churchill, a scientist with the Department of Natural Resources. 
“Now this watershed is in pretty good condition, at least for another 10 or 15 years, where we have really low fuel loads and lower fire risk,” he said. 
In contrast, areas in the footprint of the Rimrock Retreat Fire that weren’t pretreated suffered from high-severity burns that damaged the soil and decimated the vegetation.

Burns like this in that part of the state can end up converting forest habitat to a shrub steppe — at least for years to come, Churchill said. The scorched land can also invite invasive species and is at higher risk of landslides.
“If you lose your big trees in a fire like this, we’ve lost them for, I won’t say forever, but for a long time,” Churchill said. “These soils will come back eventually, but it definitely takes a lot longer when you cook the soil like this.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9214-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-25 19:57:06.506565

After withholding roughly $900 million from California’s K-12 and adult schools, the U.S. Education Department said today that it will release the money starting next week. But schools must agree to certain conditions first.


After withholding billions of dollars in school funding for nearly a month, the U.S. Education Department said today it would release the money, starting next week. 
But some school officials are still waiting until they have cash in hand before celebrating. 
“The only way to know is next week, which is when these funds are supposed to arrive, but I am worried about what sort of hoops they want us to go through to be compliant,” said Kindra Britt, a spokesperson for California County Superintendents, an organization that includes all of the state’s 58 county superintendents. 
Normally, California’s department of education begins working with the federal government in the spring so that K-12 and adult schools can start spending federal money on July 1 — but this year is different. On June 30, the state education department learned that the Trump administration planned to withhold more than $800 million intended to support a slew of essential services in California, such as after-school programs and professional development for teachers. The administration also said it would withhold roughly $100 million for adult education, including money for English-language learning and high school equivalency courses. 
Several California counties laid off workers soon after the announcement, said Britt. California Attorney General Rob Bonta sued U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon, arguing that the department is required to disburse the funds because Congress already appropriated them. 
Last week the Trump administration partly relented by allowing the money for after-school programs to flow, but on a condition that schools use the money in accordance with the U.S. Constitution and other federal non-discrimination laws. The administration has used similar language as a pretext to propose cutting or delaying funding for diversity initiatives. 
Today the administration said it would release the rest of the funds starting Monday, but the same conditions apply. In an email to adult education administrators, the U.S. Education Department said it was prepared to claw back any dollars used for “unallowable activities.” Based on the administration’s previous actions, those activities could include promoting diversity or allowing transgender girls to compete in girls’ sports.
“Nearly two weeks after California joined with 23 other states to sue the Trump administration and nearly a month after grants were due to states, the administration has finally announced a plan to release education funds that they are illegally withholding,” said Michelle Hatfield, a public information officer with the California Department of Education. “In the meantime, school is already in session in parts of California and the Trump administration’s actions continue to negatively impact California students.” 
Nonetheless, Hatfield said she’s hopeful that the Trump administration “follows through” and sends the money to California quickly. 
Bonta’s original lawsuit against the U.S. Education Department is still “ongoing,” said Elissa Perez, a spokesperson for the state’s justice department. “This is one of the latest examples of the Trump Administration sowing chaos to services and sectors that are critically important to Americans nationwide.”
Despite the potential for future litigation, many school officials say the release of federal funds is a victory and a testament to their advocacy. State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond spoke out repeatedly about the funding delays, and lawmakers, including Congressional Republicans, agreed.
“We’re moving in the right direction,” said Troy Flint, chief communications officer with the California School Boards Association. “The funds never should have been held in the first place.” Sharon Bonney, the CEO of Coalition on Adult Basic Education, said she was “elated” when the education department notified her. But she acknowledged that the month of delayed funding still had a serious impact. “There have been a number of programs that shuttered their doors or already started delivering a fraction of services.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/111523-Keyes-School-District-LV_CM-19.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-25 19:57:06.506565

Jared Polis discusses K-12 school funding with U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon at the National Governors Association meeting in Colorado Springs on July 25, 2025. (Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)Gov. Jared Polis and Education Secretary Linda McMahon talked K-12 school funding and strategies for getting students workforce-ready during a panel with governors from across the country on Friday in Colorado Springs. 
The panel was organized by the National Governors Association, which Polis currently chairs. The association convenes governors and their staff members, and serves as “a leading forum for bipartisan policy solutions.” 
The panel discussion started shortly after the Trump administration said it plans to release about $5 billion in federal K-12 school funds that have been frozen for weeks. The initial move to withhold the funding, which is designated for teacher training, migrant education, English-language learning and other programs, left Colorado school districts scrambling. About $80 million of the paused funds are earmarked for Colorado, and on July 14, state Attorney General Phil Weiser joined a lawsuit calling for their release.

“Many of us were very worried about several funds that our schools had expected,” Polis said. “We’re very pleased that you were able to announce earlier today that those funds have become unfrozen.”
Polis asked McMahon about “how can we prevent these kinds of communications gaps or discrepancies in the first place?” 
McMahon attributed the pause to “the transition aspect” and “taking time to really review the funding, to look at all the programs, before they were released.” She added, “that was satisfied.”
As chair of the association, Polis led the yearlong “Let’s Get Ready” initiative, focusing on ways that state governments can improve educational outcomes through better data collection and school accountability. The initiative recommends that states measure and publish information about academic indicators like students’ reading and math levels, but also workforce preparedness, civic engagement and mental health.
“We need to be making sure that we are truly making progress for students,” Polis said. “We are measuring the metric of improving graduation rates, and we want to make sure that one way that states can do that is not simply to dumb down the standards and make it easier to graduate. If we are looking at improving math scores, we want to make sure the answer is not just making things easier.”
McMahon called for an increased focus on postsecondary pathways beyond four-year university degrees, including apprenticeships and trade school.
“It comes down to the curriculum, which is on the state and local level, and what courses are being taught,” McMahon said. “I’ve heard a couple of governors say today, ‘wouldn’t it be cool to get back to shop?’ We want to get back to some of those subjects that can be taught in school that have been eliminated, that go into the development of our workforce.”
McMahon emphasized “returning education to the states” to regulate. President Donald Trump has ordered for the closure of the Department of Education, and the department has undergone mass layoffs.
The National Governors Association meeting is scheduled to continue on Saturday, when Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is set to speak.

Missouri House Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins of Bowling Green said he received a call Friday afternoon from the White House after staff read his comments published Thursday in The Independent.
“We do redistricting every 10 years,” Perkins said Thursday. “We’ve already done that. To do it again would be out of character with the way Missouri operates.”
‘We’ve already done that’: Missouri lawmakers show little enthusiasm for new congressional maps

During the call Friday, he said, after verifying he was quoted accurately, he was told it was important to President Donald Trump. 
“They said ‘well, we’re really going to try to do that’ and that might change the dynamic of it,” Perkins said.
The presumed target for the change is Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City, who has held the 5th District seat since 2005 and was re-elected in November with 60% of the vote.
Cleaver’s office did not respond to an email seeking comment on the White House effort to defeat him by altering his district.
Missouri’s other Democrat, U.S. Rep. Wesley Bell of St. Louis, represents the 1st District.
To achieve a delegation with seven Republicans, Kansas City would need to be sliced into multiple districts instead of being encompassed by one. Neighborhoods heavy with Democratic votes would be added adjoining districts — the 5th shares a border with the 6th District, held by Republican U.S. Rep. Sam Graves of Tarkio, and the 4th District, held by Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Alford of Raymore — or combined with enough Republican votes to make the 5th District a safe GOP seat.
The White House political staff who made the call, Perkins said, told him they would be calling every GOP member of the Missouri House delegation as well as Gov. Mike Kehoe to push the project forward.
Kehoe’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
 Missouri Congressional districts (Missouri Secretary of State’s Office.)
The reason the White House staff gave for the pressure is that Democrats are looking at redistricting California and Illinois to their advantage, Perkins said.
“That might be true, but I don’t like gerrymandering lines,” Perkins said. “I like things to be clear, concise and compact.”
The internal question for Republicans in the 2022 redistricting debate was whether they could reach for a 7-1 map without putting seats at risk by diluting their voting strength. That intraparty fight mixed with personality clashes in a dysfunctional state Senate that put passing any redistricting plan into question up until the final votes.
“To me, the arguments that were good arguments against it two years ago probably are still the same good arguments,” Perkins said Friday. “ But if someone comes up with a plan, we’ll take a look at it.”
The Missouri Freedom Caucus, the faction that clashed repeatedly with Senate GOP leadership, on Friday called for Kehoe to “immediately” call a special session for redistricting and changes to the initiative petition process.
“It’s time this super-majority Republican Party in Missouri grows a spine and actually delivers the Congressional map that reflects the strong conservative values of this great state,” the caucus posted on social media.
Other Republican lawmakers on Thursday told The Independent they weren’t excited about another round of redistricting, including Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin of Shelbina and state Sen. Mike Cierpiot of Lee’s Summit.
O’Laughlin did not respond to messages asking if she, too, had heard from the White House. Cierpiot said he had not.
If Republicans want to move forward, Kehoe could call a special session that would complete maps before the new election year begins. Otherwise, the work would take place in the regular session that begins in January and ends in May.
Democrats could filibuster any bill changing the districts and the only way to get it to a vote in the state Senate would be to use the rule to shut down debate, known as the previous question. It was used twice at the end of this year’s session, and Democrats have already vowed that Republicans will pay a price for that breach of bipartisanship.
Using it in a special session to gain a political edge for the GOP would make retribution worse, Perkins said.
“Then how does that break down how everything will run come January, because it will have consequences,” Perkins said.
The biggest impetus to move on redistricting, he said, would be a desire to please the president.
“If you’re a Republican state senator, a Republican state representative,” Perkins said, “you don’t want to be on the wrong side of this president.”

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — South Dakotans should know what stays and what goes at South Dakota Public Broadcasting — absent a philanthropic or state budget lifeline — within the next two weeks.
Whatever happens, SDPB’s director says, the public will have two months’ notice before programs and voices disappear. 
The recent congressional clawback of federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting cost SDPB about $2.2 million, which is about 20% of its budget.
SDPB is a state entity, and its staff members are state employees. The organization also receives support from the nonprofit Friends of SDPB.
Julie Overgaard, SDPB’s executive director, told budget committee lawmakers this week she’s looking at layoffs for up to 20 staff members and local content cuts across its radio and television operations as a result.
SD Public Broadcasting considering cuts, layoffs after Congress rescinds federal funding

The state’s Educational Telecommunications Board reviewed a proposed downsizing plan in a closed door session in Sioux Falls on Friday afternoon. The board’s charge is to ensure SDPB operates within the legal corners of its broadcast licenses.
After the executive session, Overgaard told South Dakota Searchlight “we’re going to do everything we can to save our statewide coverage and all of our broadcast licenses.”
“Nobody should see their SDPB radio or TV signal go away because of this,” she said.
The downsizing plan will have an audience with the board for the Friends of SDPB on Monday. 
After that, Overgaard will show the plan to the commissioner of the Bureau of Information Technology — the government office under which SDPB is nested — and Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen before offering it to Gov. Larry Rhoden for final approval. The governor needs to approve layoffs for state agencies, Overgaard said.
If Rhoden signs off, staff and the public — in that order — will be notified of “the people and programs we’re going to lose, if there is no fix applied.”
“It’s not the state’s job to fill that entire fiscal hole,” Overgaard said, but she hopes the governor will at least consider funding to help SDPB continue livestreaming state government proceedings. The state owns the equipment used to livestream legislative and other government meetings, while the money to operate it comes from the SDPB budget. 
Friends of SDPB intends to dip into its endowment to make sure none of the content changes come until Oct. 31, and Overgaard said the intervening months will determine how many of the plan’s listed layoffs and program cuts ultimately come to pass.

“To the extent that we’re able to fundraise, find foundation support and find business support, those things will come off the list,” Overgaard said. “People will be reinstated, programs will be reinstated.”
Kay Jorgensen, president of the Educational Telecommunications Board, urged SDPB’s supporters to “do what they did during the legislative session,” by throwing their support behind the system. 
Former Gov. Kristi Noem had proposed an evisceration of SDPB’s state-level funding before her departure to join President Donald Trump’s cabinet as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. State lawmakers rejected those efforts.
Before the closed-door session, the board heard a report on the system’s financial health through June, the month before Congress opted to ax public media money. SDPB was in the black and living well within its means, Jorgensen said.
In the face of the new reality created by congressional recission, Jorgensen added, “our goal is to stay lit, and to serve the public as we always have.”
“We would ask the public to articulate their views on why public broadcasting is so important, to share it with their friends and neighbors, and certainly with the policymakers on the local, state and national levels,” Jorgensen said.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A judge has dismissed a lawsuit from environmentalists that argued Utah’s now-failed petition to the U.S. Supreme Court to gain control of millions of acres of federal land was unconstitutional, which would have prevented the state from bringing a similar case forward in the future.  
On Wednesday, 3rd District Court Judge Thaddeus May dismissed the lawsuit from the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, siding with the state in a case that stems from Utah’s 2024 petition to wrest control of 18.5 million acres of Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, land. 
But since the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Utah’s case, May said the environmental group’s argument is now moot.

“The non-existence of that suit is fatal,” May wrote, while also finding the group’s “statements about any future action to be too vague to be redressable.”
The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, or SUWA, disagreed with the ruling — since Utah leaders, including Gov. Spencer Cox, have suggested they will try to re-file the lawsuit in a lower court, they still have a case, the group said. 
Utah filed its lawsuit with the country’s high court in August of last year, arguing that it’s unconstitutional for the BLM to hold “unappropriated land” — land that lacks a formal designation — in perpetuity. Unappropriated land does not include national parks, monuments, or forests. It’s often used for cattle grazing or wildlife habitat, with much of it found in Utah’s west desert. 
SUWA filed a lawsuit in December arguing the petition violated the Utah Constitution. Utah, the constitution reads, must “forever disclaim all right and title to the unappropriated public lands.” 
But not long after SUWA filed its lawsuit, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Utah’s case, which the state was attempting to bring directly before the high court. State leaders, including Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, said they might try filing a similar lawsuit in a lower court. 
SUWA then filed an amended complaint, based on Cox and other leaders’ comments, in an effort to prevent the state from trying to revive its lawsuit. 
Could Utah re-file its public lands lawsuit? The state — and a judge — are deliberating

In a hearing last week, May heard arguments for and against keeping the lawsuit going. During the hearing, May seemed to suggest it would be easier for SUWA to sue Utah once they actually re-filed their complaint. 
“If the suit is unknown, why is it not better to wait for that suit to be filed in federal court and then have a reaction? Why does this court have to preempt that decision or that lawsuit?” May asked. 
In a statement, SUWA’s legal director Steve Bloch said he disagreed with the ruling, and was considering “potential next steps.” 
“We’re disappointed with today’s decision but grateful that the true intent of the state’s lawsuit has been made clear: to force the sale of millions of acres of public lands to the highest bidder and not to acquire these lands for the state, as its deliberately misleading media campaign suggests,” Bloch said. “It’s our position that with the repeated statements made by Governor Cox — doubling down on the state’s intent to refile its lawsuit in federal district court — Judge May had what he needed to proceed with our case and conclude that Utah’s constitution prohibits the state from bringing a lawsuit like this in the first place.”

Gov. Sara Rodriguez announced her campaign Friday and Attorney General Josh Kaul declined to comment on his plans.  (Photos by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner) Less than 24 hours after Gov. Tony Evers announced he wouldn’t run for another term in office, the field for the Democratic primary for governor is beginning to take shape as Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez launched  her campaign Friday morning while other potential candidates are still considering. 
Evers’ video announcing that he would retire because of his family ended months of speculation about a potential third term and triggered the start of the first open race for governor in Wisconsin since 2010. 
The Republican field is still shaping up, with Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann and Whitefish Bay manufacturer Bill Berrien have officially announced. Other potential candidates include U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany and businessmen Eric Hovde and Tim Michels, both of whom have recently lost statewide campaigns. 
The first Democrat in the race, Rodriguez in her campaign launch video took aim both at Republicans in Washington and at the GOP majority in the Legislature. 
“We’ve got a maniac in the White House. His tariffs are killing our farmers and his policies are hurting our kids,” Rodriguez said of President Donald Trump. “Our [state] Legislature refuses to expand Medicaid, even though 41 other states have done it. I mean Arkansas expanded Medicaid. Arkansas, but not Wisconsin. I’ll get it done.” 
Rodriguez was elected lieutenant governor in 2022, when Evers won his second term. She succeeded former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who ran an unsuccessful campaign for the U.S. Senate against Republican Sen. Ron Johnson that year. 
“I’ve been an ER nurse, a public health expert and a small business owner. I’m used to being on my feet and getting right to the point,” Rodriguez said in her video. “I have an announcement: I’m running for governor.” 
“I know what you’re thinking, you don’t have the time for the rest of this video,” Rodriguez said. “Look, I get it I’m a busy parent too, so here’s what you should know: I’ve got two kids that are way too embarrassed to be in this video, a dog named Chico and I met my husband salsa dancing – all true. My parents were Wisconsin dairy farmers. My dad served during Vietnam and fixed telephones at Wisconsin Bell. Mom was a union member who helped kids with special needs.”
Rodriguez got degrees in neuroscience and nursing before working as a nurse in an emergency room in Baltimore. She has also worked for the Centers for Disease Control and has served as vice president for several health care-related businesses, including at Advocate Aurora Health from 2017-2020.
Rodriguez said in the video that entering politics wasn’t part of her plan, but seeing “a broken system” she decided to run for the Assembly. She flipped a Republican seat that covered parts of Milwaukee and Waukesha in 2020 by 735 votes, and served for one term before making her run for lieutenant governor in 2021. After winning the Democratic primary, she joined Evers on the ticket. 
The Democratic Lieutenant Governors Association quickly endorsed Rodriguez Friday.
Rodriguez noted that control of the state Legislature is also at stake in 2026, with Democrats having the chance under new, fairer maps adopted in 2024 to win control. The last time there was a Democratic trifecta in Wisconsin was in the 2009-2010 session. 
“Look, we’ve got a real shot at flipping the state Legislature, and with a Democratic governor we can finally expand Medicaid and boost our health care workforce. We can strengthen our farms and unions and small businesses, fund our public schools and give teachers the raise they’ve earned. That’s the right path, and it’s what you and your family deserve,” Rodriguez said. “I can’t wait to earn your vote.”
Other Democrats on whether they’ll run
Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said in a statement Friday morning that he cares about the future direction of Wisconsin and that “I will be taking steps toward entering the race for Governor,” in the coming weeks. 
“The stakes are simply too high to sit on the sidelines,” Crowley said. “Governor Evers has laid a strong foundation. I believe it’s our responsibility to build on that progress — and I look forward to engaging in that conversation with the people of Wisconsin.” 
Crowley, 33, was elected to the county’s top office in 2020, the first African American and the youngest person to serve in the position. During his time in the job, Crowley has been a staunch  advocate for the state’s largest county, including helping secure a sales tax increase for Milwaukee. He also previously served for two terms in the state Assembly.
Asked whether she plans to run, state Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) told the Wisconsin Examiner Friday she is “giving it really serious consideration.” Roys came in third in the 2018 primary that nominated Evers.
“This is going to be a wide open primary,” Roys said. “I don’t think anybody has a strong advantage in it, and I think the stakes are incredibly high.” 
Roys said she thought Evers has “given more than anyone could ask to this state” and has earned the right to do whatever he wants. She said, however, that Democrats shouldn’t rely on old tactics in 2026 and that people want a candidate who will inspire them.
“Tony Evers has been a beloved governor of this state, and so I think he would have certainly been able to win a third term if that’s what he wanted to do,” Roys said. “At the same time, I think that there is a real hunger in the party and in the country generally, to see the next generation of leaders getting a chance, and we have a very strong bench in Wisconsin.”
Roys also ran for the U.S. House in 2012, losing in the primary for the 2nd District to U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan. 
Roys said that there is a lot at stake in the 2026 race. The country is at an “incredibly dangerous moment” with the Republican control in Washington, D.C., she said, and Wisconsin Democrats could have a “incredible opportunity” to deliver on an array of issues at the state level, including funding public education, supporting Wisconsin’s public universities and technical colleges, expanding access to health care, addressing the high cost of housing and child care, and protecting peoples’ rights and freedoms. 
For the last five years, Roys has served in the state Senate, including as a member of the Joint Finance Committee, and has been a strong advocate for funding child care and reproductive rights. 
Recalling her time in the Assembly from 2009-2013, including the last session when Democrats held a trifecta, Roys said Democrats didn’t accomplish enough.
“I’m determined to make sure that we do not blow this opportunity,” Roys said. “I think we need strong leadership from our next Democratic governor to make sure that we deliver for people in this state.” 
Roys said she is considering many factors in deciding whether to join the race, including whether she would be the right person for the position, her recent experience and her family, including their security.
Whether she runs or not, Roys said she will work across the state to help Democrats flip both houses. She isn’t up for reelection this year and Democrats have set a goal of winning control of the Senate and Assembly for the first time in over 15 years. 
“My hope is that all the candidates who are considering a run for governor are prioritizing flipping the Legislature,” Roys said. During Evers’ two terms with a Republican majority in both houses, “He wrote great budgets. They threw them in the garbage,” she said. “He wanted to pass a lot of great legislation that Democrats offered in the Legislature, and he could hardly sign many into law, because he was busy with that veto pen.” 
Attorney General Josh Kaul, who would likely be a top candidate if he runs, declined to tell reporters about his plans Friday, saying that it is important to reflect on Evers’ service and “the significance of where we’ve come in the last six and a half years.” 
“I don’t have any announcement today,” Kaul said. “I think in the next several weeks, you’ll hear from a number of people as to where they stand.” 
Kaul was first elected to the statewide position in 2018 and won a second term in 2022 in a close race against Eric Toney, a Republican prosecutor from Fond du Lac County. Since Trump took office for his second term, Kaul has joined several multistate lawsuits to push back on some of the federal government’s actions, including the withholding of funding
Other potential candidates include Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson and former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Lawmakers deliberated behind closed doors for more than an hour-and-a-half Friday afternoon about whether a high-ranking New Mexico senator will face discipline over alleged harassment of a legislative staffer.
Four state senators on the interim Legislative Ethics Committee and a retired New Mexico Supreme Court justice concluded their discussion before 5 p.m., but as of publication had not issued the written order containing its recommendations, according to  Chris Nordstrom, a spokesperson for Senate Democrats. Source will update this story when it does.
Friday’s hearing centered on whether an email exchange and phone call in February between Senate President Pro Tempore Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque) and legislative staffer Michelle Jaschke, violated the Legislature’s anti-harassment policy.
Jaschke did not respond to messages seeking comment Friday afternoon on the committee’s recommendation.
Employment and labor lawyer Lorna Wiggins, who served as special counsel in the matter for the Ethics Committee’s investigative subcommittee, on May 18 issued her report after interviewing Jaschke and Stewart. Source NM requested a copy of the report from the Legislative Council Service but did not receive a copy prior to publication.
On Friday, Wiggins summarized her findings to the committee.
Jaschke, the capital outlay programs coordinator for the Legislative Council Service, emailed Stewart on Feb. 27 some time after 5 p.m. to ask about her capital outlay funding request — to help finance projects in lawmakers’ districts which had been due at 5 p.m. the day before.
In response, Stewart wrote: “WE SENT IT TO YOU YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AROUND 3:30…” according to a copy of the email Stewart’s attorney Ray Vargas presented to the committee.
Moments later, Stewart called Jaschke, “screaming at her using what she deemed pejorative language, including calling her stupid for not knowing that the sheet had already been turned in,” Wiggins said.
Jaschke told Wiggins that Stewart’s “verbal attack” affected her mental and physical well-being, including her ability to sleep, and that she took at least one sick day because “she was angry and upset at the interaction.”
Wiggins said Stewart acknowledged yelling at Jaschke, admitted using an angry tone during their phone call and admitted she may have used the word “stupid” during the call. Stewart also conceded that using all-capital letters is the equivalent of yelling at someone, Wiggins said.
Wiggins argued Stewart’s actions rose to the level of harassment because a reasonable person in Jaschke’s position would view the email and call as “hurtful, demeaning and caused her discomfort,” and could conclude it was “humiliating, intimidating and insulting.”
In his defense of her, Vargas said Stewart regretted her actions and later apologized. Moreover, he argued, the policy’s harassment definition requires “threatening, intimidating or coercive” verbal or physical behavior.
Stewart, he said, in a “high-stress moment, lost her cool and she was impolite to Ms. Jaschke. No, she wasn’t just impolite, she was downright rude,” Vargas said. “What she wasn’t though, was harassing, certainly not under the way harassment is defined under this policy.”
Vargas read a statement from Stewart reiterating her regrets about the incidents:
“I believe it’s important that we legislators treat everyone with kindness and respect, especially our staff,” the statement said. “During the legislative session, when all of us are rushed, under pressure and tempers can flare, it’s even more important to exhibit calmness and kindness. I regret that I failed to do that with Michelle. When I was informed of her reaction, I sent her a letter of apology. I stand by that apology, I plan to continue to monitor my reactions to others. I’m seeing a mental health counselor now to ensure my kindness and respect for others is on solid footing, and I’m committed to always learning from others and growing in my ability to help others.”
Vargas warned that if the committee decided to punish Stewart, it could have far-reaching implications for the Legislature as a whole.
“Everyone in the Roundhouse will be walking on eggshells,” Vargas said. “Everyone will be afraid to say the wrong thing, or afraid that if they’re passionate about a subject, it’s going to get confused for harassment.”

Vermont Superior Court Judge Kerry McDonald-Cady ruled to dismiss the case with prejudice, meaning Moffitt can’t be tried on the same charges again. The decision has already been appealed.

The Vermont Supreme Court is set to decide whether the case against Deven Moffitt, accused of murdering his ex-girlfriend, has been too mishandled to see trial. 
For over a year, Moffitt’s lawyer has tried to get the case tossed out for good — claiming the prosecution lacks sufficient evidence to take Moffitt to court. 
Earlier this week, on June 20, Vermont Superior Court Judge Kerry McDonald-Cady ruled to dismiss the case with prejudice, meaning Moffitt can’t be tried on those charges again. An appeal of that decision will bring the dispute to the state Supreme Court. 
Moffitt’s lawyer alleged the prosecution made missteps properly confirming the identity of the human remains in the case. The state medical examiner’s office originally identified the remains as belonging to Lauren Hildenbrandt’s before Moffitt was charged with her murder in the second degree back in 2022.

But, in the years since, the prosecution failed to run more tests to confirm the original identification of the remains. 
“The state had more than two years to test the discovered remains and obtain additional DNA evidence for trial to confirm they were, in fact, the remains of Ms. Hildenbrandt,” wrote McDonald-Cady in the July 20 ruling. 
Back in January, prosecutors asked the judge to formally dismiss the case without prejudice, meaning they could refile the charge at a later date. In response, Moffitt’s lawyer motioned to dismiss the case with prejudice, meaning it could never be brought to court again. 
Deputy State’s Attorney Jared Bianchi argued against that motion. He explained that his office plans to press other criminal charges against Moffitt, and it would be most convenient to resolve them all in one trial, according to the ruling. 
That didn’t convince the judge. Over years, the state’s attorney’s office tried to press a number of additional charges against Moffitt, namely an alleged aggravated assault and multiple counts of obstruction of justice, court documents show. 
But on each count, the Bennington state’s attorney’s office had either failed to press charges swiftly enough, or the crime was committed in another county, putting it out of Bennington’s jurisdiction, McDonald-Cady wrote. 
Unconvinced by Bianchi’s arguments, the judge dismissed the case with prejudice, attempting to put the charge to rest for good.
“This Court recognizes the gravity of this decision for the State, the Defendant, the community, and especially the family and friends of Ms. Hildenbrandt,” wrote McDonald-Cady in her ruling. 
While permanently tossing the case out was an “extraordinary remedy,” she reasoned the prosecution had overstepped by drawing out the case, according to the ruling. 
Later this week, on July 23, Bianchi appealed McDonald-Cady’s ruling to the Vermont Supreme Court. There, justices can decide if Moffitt may be tried again for the same crime. 
Bianchi is still serving a 12 and a half year sentence for federal drug and firearm charges.

Donald Norcross, left, and Herb Conaway speaking at the  Wrightstown Municipal Building about the Trump administration's plans to house undocumented immigrants at Fort Dix on July 25, 2025. (Morgan Leason | New Jersey Monitor)WRIGHTSTOWN — Reps. Herb Conaway and Donald Norcross expressed frustration Friday that they have not heard any more details from the Trump administration about its plan to house detained immigrants at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.
The comments from the congressmen, both Democrats, came following a tour of the base, about a week after Conaway received a letter from U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth revealing the plan. Military commanders at Fort Dix told the two men that there has not been an order yet to use the base’s facilities to house migrants, they said.
“I have never, in my 11 years of being in Congress … been shut out by our own government, trying to get the information on what might or might not happen on a base that happens to be in our backyard,” Norcross said.
Conaway said reports of poor conditions from other U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers across the country have him nervous about the Fort Dix plan.
“We’ve seen people, citizens and noncitizens alike, beaten on the streets. We have seen detainees who have been forced and remain in stress positions for a long period of time, indeed, with their hands tied behind their backs, forced to eat off plates, as a dog might have to eat,” Conaway told the New Jersey Monitor. “The people have been housed with feces and urine in their areas, where men and women have to use the same lavatory facilities, where little attention was paid to any health care needs, even clothing needs.”
Conaway added that detained migrants are often improperly cut off from legal counsel and family contact.
“You’re on American soil. You have the benefit and protection of the Constitution. That has long been understood,” Conaway said.
The Fort Dix plan is part of the Trump administration’s push to detain and deport millions of undocumented immigrants. The budget bill President Donald Trump signed earlier this month included $45 billion to build new immigration jails and hire 10,000 new immigration enforcement agents.
Democrats have assailed the plan, saying it would harm military readiness, while immigrant advocates said housing detained immigrants on a military base would hamper public oversight of migrant detention. Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former assemblyman seeking to become New Jersey’s new governor, has said this is a problem of Democrats’ own making, saying they put out a “welcome mat for illegal immigrants with their dangerous Sanctuary State policies.”
Conaway said he trusts that Fort Dix military commanders would act responsibly in hosting the detainees, but he would not say the same about the leadership at the Department of Homeland Security or ICE, which would operate the detention site independently of the military.
Spokespeople for the Department of Homeland Security and ICE did not respond to requests for comment.

The meeting in Jackson was a primer on Medicaid programs and provided a financial update for new members, most of whom were appointed in 2024 but have not yet participated in a meeting. 
The Medicaid Advisory Committee offers expertise and opinions to the state Medicaid program about health care services. It is made up of doctors, hospital executives, managed care organization representatives and other Medicaid stakeholders.

It includes two members of the recently formed Beneficiary Advisory Council, a group of Medicaid members and their families who advise Medicaid on their experience with the program. 
New federal policy seeks to heighten the role that beneficiaries play in shaping Medicaid programs and policy by mandating that members of the council serve on the Medicaid Advisory Committee. Ten percent of the group must be composed of beneficiaries or their families, a proportion that will rise in the coming years. 
Both committees are mandated by the federal government to meet quarterly. 
The last Medicaid Advisory Committee meeting, formerly known as the Medical Care Advisory Committee, was held on Dec. 8, 2023. 
Meetings were first set back in 2024 because state leaders, who were formerly charged with selecting members, were slow to make appointments. A meeting scheduled for October was postponed after former executive director Drew Snyder announced his resignation.

Meetings were then delayed further while the agency worked to sort out a discrepancy between state law and new federal guidelines, which mandated that committee appointments be made by the executive director of Medicaid and include members of the then-unformed Beneficiary Advisory Council. The new guidelines took effect this month. 
State lawmakers proposed language in several bills earlier this year during the legislative session that would have conformed state law to federal regulations. Two such bills were vetoed by the governor. 
Medicaid Executive Director Cindy Bradshaw said the agency decided to “honor the language” of the vetoed bills, conforming to federal guidelines without updating state law.

Melissa Bounty, the executive director of a nonprofit dedicated to supporting local businesses in central Vermont, was put on paid leave Monday pending the “outcome of an investigation.” It is unknown what the organization is investigating.The Central Vermont Economic Development Corporation is one of a dozen regional economic development corporations around the state dedicated to supporting local business. Close to all of the nonprofit’s revenue stems from state and federal dollars.  
The administrative leave letter, signed by the corporation’s Board Chair Ed Larson, Vice Chair Jody Emerson and Treasurer Reuben Stone, was obtained by VTDigger.
In the letter, directors told Bounty she was being placed on paid leave for the length of the inquiry. They wrote that Bounty being removed from the workplace was necessary to “allow for a thorough and impartial investigation.” The board also said placing Bounty on administrative leave was “not intended to imply wrongdoing or to prejudge the results of the investigation.
When asked about the investigation into Bounty, Emerson said she could not speak about any part of the investigation because the board cannot comment on “personnel matters.”“I stand by my work and my integrity,” Bounty wrote in a statement to VTDigger on Thursday. “I care so deeply for the Central Vermont business community and have been honored to learn more about the wonderful work happening in this vibrant region every day.”Bounty also noted the vague nature of the investigation.“I have not received any information about the concerns of my board or the reason for my administrative leave,” she wrote. “And I am fully committed to supporting a process that brings transparency about any questions in the work and output of the organization.”Bounty said she could not comment further.A police dispatcher at the Montpelier Police Department told VTDigger there was an “active investigation” into Bounty that did not allow for the retrieval of any records related to the matter.Washington County State Attorney Michelle Donnelly said her office had not yet been alerted to any investigation related to Bounty.According to Bounty’s yearly review, obtained by VTDigger through a source familiar with the matter, multiple business owners praised her for her work at the nonprofit.“Her abilities, experience and skills never cease to amaze me,” one business owner wrote.Another owner wrote that Bounty saved their business.“Without the support Melissa provided to our entire organization after the flooding in 2023 … [t]here would be 18 less good paying jobs in Central VT.”After VTDigger reached out to board members with questions about Bounty’s leave, the board’s lawyer John Valsangiacomo asked VTDigger to stop contacting board members.“We don’t have any comment,” the lawyer said Thursday.

Health officials are now testing mosquitoes for three viruses. No human cases of mosquito-borne illnesses have been reported yet this season.

In Rutland, the Jamestown Canyon virus has been detected in mosquitos for the first time in state history, the Vermont Department of Health announced Friday. Health officials also detected West Nile virus in St. Albans.
There have been no human or animal cases of mosquito-borne illnesses reported this season, but health officials are urging people to protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites. Jamestown Canyon virus can cause similar illnesses to other mosquito-borne diseases. Mosquitoes are being tested for West Nile virus, Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus — which last year caused two people to get ill and one of them to die — and Jamestown Canyon virus starting from this year.
“Every mosquito group is tested for all three viruses now,” said Natalie Kwit, a public health veterinarian at the Vermont Department of Health. “We added it (Jamestown Canyon virus) because it’s something we knew that’s been circulating in the Northeast, and we had a cost-effective test available that we switched to that included all three viruses.”
The Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets and the Vermont Department of Health decided to continue allocating funding to mosquito surveillance this year over tick surveillance to track illnesses like Eastern equine encephalitis after the cases occurred last year. The mosquito surveillance program generally runs from June to mid-October when mosquitos are more active.

Kwit said most people who become infected with these viruses don’t get sick, but some may develop symptoms a few days, or even weeks, after the mosquito bite.
Symptoms may include fever, body aches, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, rash and joint pains. The viruses can also lead to more serious illnesses like meningitis or encephalitis — an inflammation of the brain that can cause brain damage, stroke and death.
Cases of mosquitoes testing positive to Eastern equine encephalitis have increased significantly in recent years. According to data from the health department, in 2023, 14 groups of mosquitoes across three Vermont towns tested positive for EEE, whereas in 2024, 86 groups of mosquitoes across 16 towns tested positive.
Kwit said only about 5% of people infected with EEE develop a more serious illness. “The thing that worries us the most about Triple E is that about 30 to 40% of people with that severe form of illness die from the disease, so this one tends to be the most severe that we know of,” she said.
There are no vaccines to prevent Eastern equine encephalitis and Jamestown Canyon virus, nor medicines to treat them. The best way to limit the risk of infection is to prevent mosquito bites, according to the health department.
Recommendations from the Vermont Department of Health include wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants, limiting time outside at dawn or dusk when there are more mosquitoes, using insect repellent — the Environmental Protection Agency has a tool to help people identify the right repellent for them — fix holes in screens attached to doors and windows and get rid of standing water that might attract mosquitoes.

[…]","A combine harvester in wheat fields at P&J Ranches near Sheridan, MT, on on August 28, 2019. (USDA Photo / Lance Cheung)Montana ranchers, farmers and the state’s tourism industry expressed deep concern with President Donald Trump’s tariffs during a press call on Thursday.
Uncertainty is a major issue, they said, and the actions have set the United States up as an “unreliable trade partner” which is damaging to those who depend on markets outside the country.
The Trump administration recently announced new 30% tariffs on the European Union and Mexico, 35% tariffs on Canada, and 50% tariffs on Brazil. Montana exports $2.4 billion goods annually, with Canada accounting for 37% of the state’s total goods exports, according to statistics from Tariffs Cost US, an advocacy organization. 
“Instability is the bane of ag producers. We can plan ahead whenever we can. We have so many things we can’t plan for, weather, sickness, disease, all kinds of stuff that we have no kind of control over and never will,” said Benjamin Peterson, a farmer and rancher on E. L. Peterson Ranch, which is just north of Judith Gap. “And you add in governmental and trade instability, it makes it 100 times worse.”
Peterson specifically detailed an issue around markets in Pacific Rim countries like South Korea, Japan and Vietnam. American checkoff marketing campaigns had been effective in those countries — in fact, there’s an entire facility in Oregon dedicated to marketing American (including Montanan) wheat, catering to a number of international entities interested in wheat products from this country. Montana is the third-leading wheat producing state in the U.S. 
Markets in those countries for American products were built over years and fell in a day, Peterson said.
“Those areas and those markets are gone, and the chances of those of us getting those back are very low because they went over and bought cheaper products, maybe not as good a product, but cheaper product from Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Venezuela,” Peterson said about American beef. “We may never get those back.”
The price of beef is high right now, but it’s mostly a demand for low-quality, imported beef. The type many Montana ranchers are raising is of higher quality, and Peterson said the only thing anyone knows going into next year is that price will be volatile.
There’s also a shortage of high-quality cattle, Montana Farmers Union President Walt Schweitzer said. 
“Most of the livestock producing stage in the last five years have experienced severe drought, and we haven’t started rebuilding our herd,” Schweitzer said.”And so the reason our cattle prices are high is because of the shortage of live animals to harvest and I’m a little concerned that we’re not going to get through this as quick as we could, just because of the tariffs that are going to be imposed.”
Peterson said baseline costs on fertilizer and minerals have increased. Schweitzer added the tariffs have also put stress on the American food system, which already had a major shock from COVID.
Immigration policy is also a concern and adds cost if more food is grown outside the country.
“We use foreign labor because we don’t have a choice,” Schweitzer said. “So if you take that labor out of the system, food prices are going to go up, and food systems are going to move out of the country, as far as who’s going to grow them.”
Added Peterson: “Good, high-quality food is going to become the food of the rich.”
A farmer, John Wicks, the owner of Tiber Ridge Organics south of Chester, said parts for agricultural tools are becoming a major issue. He recently sold a piece of specialized equipment because the parts came from Europe and were about 24% more expensive this season. He lost money and said he’ll have to rent it if he needs it.
“It just didn’t pencil out to keep it and have that kind of liability if things broke,” Wicks said. “So that was kind of a really difficult period. And then, you know, Montana agriculture is a generational thing, and these policies and these tariffs are pushing for corporate farms to be able to come in and take over these small family farms.”
Larger companies have more capacity to absorb losses, which can put small producers in a bind. Peterson also made a comparison to the 1980s farm crisis, a broad term used to describe various issues that combined to transfer huge numbers of land held by small farmers to larger, sometimes corporate entities. 
It also forced numerous farmers to size-up their operations and rely on oft-discussed farm subsidies to make the farms pencil out economically.
“It’s back to the ‘80s of, get big or get out,” Peterson said. “They’re just doing it with a different method.”
Schweitzer also mentioned the alarming rate of mental health issues among farmers and ranchers. Suicides among agricultural producers skyrocked during the Farm Crisis and have remained high in the years since. Montana consistently has among the highest rates of suicide per capita in the country.
“It’s caused a lot of stress for farmers and ranchers,” Schweitzer said.
  Other impacts 

Federal policy changes continue impacting the state in other ways, including Montana’s tourism economy.
While Glacier and Yellowstone National Park visitation is up, federal cuts have meant fewer parks employees. That’s been an issue, Explore Whitefish executive director Zak Anderson said during the call.
“This affects visitor services and trail maintenance and traffic flow and really everything, and then that again, it puts more pressure on local businesses and infrastructure to pick up the slack,” Anderson said. “So I guess overall, I would say that what we’re looking for as a community is some stability from policymakers, like avoiding abrupt tariff hikes or policy policy shifts that then change at a whim.”
Anderson said Canadian tourism is down 25% in Whitefish.
There’s also new tariffs on graphite as well as copper, which could also impact Montana. In 2023, for example, there were nearly 400 people working for Montana Resources at the Continental Pit Mine in Butte.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/49392074813_187802035b_k-1024x763.jpg,,,2025-07-25 18:56:24.792231

Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) discusses her efforts to protect funding for Great Lakes restoration and protection efforts amid threats of cuts from the Trump administration. July 25, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceGreat Lakes advocates and researchers on Friday cautioned against funding cuts to a critical research institute, warning that the loss of staff and funding could have dire consequences.
That included U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor), who emphasized the importance of continuing to fund efforts to keep the Great Lakes clean and healthy. 
Dingell, alongside members of the University of Michigan Water Center, the Healing Our Waters-Great Lakes Coalition, the Alliance for the Great Lakes and the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research, spoke about her concerns at Ann Arbor’s Matthaei Botanical Gardens on Friday.
The administration of President Donald Trump is proposing steep cuts to the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, and the group warned that the Great Lakes could lose another vital layer of protection as the president zeroes out funds for several key programs supported by the agency.
Mike Shriberg, director of the University of Michigan Water Center, noted that NOAA’s Great Lakes Environmental Lab had already lost 35% of its staff, while the remaining employees are under duress as they work to make up for their lost colleagues and face increased bureaucratic demands.

While the House and Senate have proposed bills maintaining funding for NOAA programs that the president eliminated, they do not restore the cuts that have already been made. 
The Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research is one agency at risk of losing its staff and funding, with Greg Dick, the institute’s director, emphasizing the critical nature of the group’s research.
The institute’s work centers on threats that impact the daily lives of the people of the Great Lakes Region, Dick explained, including threats like coastal flooding, oil spills and extreme weather.
One of the key ways the institute protects the health and safety of the Great Lakes region is through its work on harmful algal blooms, he added.
“These unsightly, smelly and highly toxic algae blooms now occur in all five Great Lakes,” Dick said. “They threaten the amazing waters that provide recreational opportunities, support numerous small businesses and serve as a source of drinking water for nearly 30 million people.”
In 2014, Toledo, Ohio lost access to drinking water for 72 hours due to a harmful algal bloom, leaving half a million people without access to tap water for a long weekend, Dick said. 
The homes, businesses and hospitals affected by the crisis were estimated to have lost a total of $65 million.
In combatting these growths, the team at the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research takes weekly samples to measure the amount of toxins and the quality of the water, works with partners to develop a five-day forecast of how algal blooms will grow and move, and utilizes cutting-edge tools to track new toxins, Dick said.
The work is driven by 50 scientists and staff members at the University of Michigan, whose work is almost entirely funded by NOAA.
Laura Rubin, director of the Healing Our Waters-Great Lakes Coalition warned that cutting great lakes science programs will cost more on the back end, when the government ultimately has to address problems that arise from abandoning these efforts, like managing invasive sea lampreys and harmful algal blooms.
Additionally, every $1 invested into Great Lakes restoration and science produces $3 in economic benefit, Rubin said.
Rubin also stressed that these programs have succeeded due to their partnerships between state and federal governments. 
“States cannot do this job by themselves. The federal government provides the ability to manage large landscape restoration projects and scientific inquiry that demand coordination and strategic direction across state and international and sovereign boundaries, as well as integrated science monitoring and technical experience,” Rubin said.
Joel Brammeier, president and CEO of the Alliance for the Great Lakes, emphasized that the Great Lakes Restoration movement was built on decades of science that has largely been supported by federal funds. 
Dingell also called attention to the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which was established in 2010. The program provides funding to states, tribes and local communities, for on the ground efforts to address the largest concerns facing the Great Lakes.
In January, Dingell alongside U.S. Reps. Bill Huizenga (R-Holland Township), David Joyce (R-Ohio) and Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio), reintroduced the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act with the support of several other lawmakers from the Great Lakes region. The bill would extend funding for the program from 2027 through 2031. 
In the U.S. Senate, Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Twp.) and Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) also introduced legislation to extend funding for the initiative.
Although the initiative has extraordinarily high value, the program is designed to supplement organizations’ base funding, Shriberg said. If the core funding is lost, that supplementary funding is no longer useful. 
Dingell said she is also cosponsoring a bill to protect funding designated for NOAA, specifically for the National Weather Service and Great Lakes programs, from being reduced or redirected. It would also require the Administrator of NOAA to report to Congress each year that they are complying with the act’s requirements, Dingell said. 
“Here’s the new reality, we can require we pass it in the appropriations bills, and then the administration isn’t taking the money we’ve authorized and spending it,” Dingell said, noting the Great Lakes is one issue you can still bring the state’s Congressional delegation together on. “We have to find a way to make sure that funding authorized and needed is getting to where it needs to go, and it needs to be done in a bipartisan way.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7254154-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-25 18:56:24.792231

(Photo courtesy of Iowa State University)Iowa State University’s athletics budget is feeling the fallout of changes to contracts and other shifts in collegiate sports infrastructure, according to budgets submitted to the Iowa Board of Regents, leading the university to halt capital projects and implement cost reduction strategies.
ISU’s proposed athletic budget for the 2026 fiscal year totals $141 million, exceeding the previous athletic budget by $27 million. According to board documents, “several transformational changes” in collegiate athletics over the past two years have resulted in projected $30 million “recurring annual financial repercussions” to the university’s athletics department, starting this year.
“ISU is engaging with the Big 12 Conference, ISU Foundation, sponsors, donors and other partners to explore additional opportunities to create growth in revenue sufficient to overcome future anticipated revenue shortfalls and to otherwise support the continued success and viability of the ISU Athletics Program,” the document stated. “ISU views this effort as one of the top priorities and challenges facing the university.”

Changes causing the fluctuation in funds include the new allowance for colleges to share revenue dollars with student athletes, the expansion of the Big 12 Conference to 16 teams and shifts in how revenue generated through the College Football Playoff is distributed among conferences, according to the document.
ISU has halted renovations to Hilton Coliseum and construction of a new wrestling practice facility, which would have cost a total of $45 million to complete, in order to help with the budget, the document stated. The university also implemented “cost reduction mandates” among each ISU sport and their support departments and put annual sales tax on sports ticket sales on the consumer — around $1.5 million annually — rather than absorbing it in the budget as an expense. This change is reflected in projected ticket sale revenue increases for fiscal year 2026.
Members of the Cyclone Club, the ISU athletic department’s donation platform and membership program, are also seeing a 20% increase in donation amounts required for membership, according to the document, which is expected to earn an additional $3 million in annual funding.
“Athletics will carefully monitor the impact of this increase on future donations,” the document stated.
While the university stated in the document it found around $8.7 million in annual savings for the athletic department, funding gaps averaging nearly $25 million annually are still projected through fiscal year 2031, when the Big 12 television contract expires. In total, the funding gap until that time comes to $147 million.
The Iowa State University Foundation is providing the athletics department with a one-time, $26.7 million transfer of athletics reserves to balance the fiscal year 2026 budget, the document stated, but those reserve dollars will not make up future gaps in funding.
Other transfers to athletics from the foundation include annual donations from the Cyclone Club, donations made for capital projects and “premium seating contributions,” according to the document.
“Historically, Athletics operated as a self-sufficient operation transferring the funds necessary to cover operating costs in the current fiscal year,” the document stated. “Prior to FY 2025 under the current administration, ISU Athletics had not incurred an operating deficit other than the COVID impacted season, which was absorbed by cash reserves.”
UI, UNI athletics budgets grow
At the University of Iowa, the athletics department’s budget is expected to grow more than 12% from last year and total nearly $170 million, according to the board document, mainly due to $20.5 million allocated for student-athlete revenue sharing.
Men’s and women’s wrestling ticket sales are expected to remain consistent with last year’s numbers, of which men’s wrestling revenues were above budget and women’s wrestling came in under what was expected. Ticket sales revenue for football is expected to increase by more than $3.3 million, putting the budget line at nearly $27.8 million and total income for fiscal year 2026 at close to $170 million.
As the only state university to provide institutional support for athletics programs, the University of Northern Iowa reported in the board document it will budget more than $5.4 million in university funding for athletics in operational support, scholarships and more. While funding for scholarships remained flat, institutional support for operations and supplemental funding both increased.
Women’s sports at UNI are expected to increase over last year, when they sold above what was budgeted. Higher ticket sales for wrestling and other men’s sports are also set to increase, according to the board documents.
UNI’s total athletics budget is projected to grow by more than $1.2 million to just under $16 million.
“Optional revenue sharing with student athletes is not budgeted at UNI for FY 2026,” the document stated.
The Iowa Board of Regents will discuss fiscal year 2026 budgets for each of Iowa’s public universities at its July 30 meeting.

The Providence City Council voted Thursday night to defeat a proposal crafted by its own president and the mayor that would have leased a vacant building to charter school Excel Academy.
But on Friday morning, the former Carl G. Lauro Elementary School was not exactly vacant. Workers went in and out of wide open doors on both sides of the 140,000-square foot building. The hum of several of the approximately 35 air conditioners could be heard from the sidewalk, as could the occasional power tool.  
The building at 99 Kenyon St. costs Providence about $300,000 annually, said Josh Estrella, a spokesperson for Mayor Brett Smiley. The work is essentially to keep the building from falling into disrepair, and Estrella said the costs include utilities, general maintenance, roof work, fire alarms, and labor. The building needs to be preserved because the state-run Providence Public School District (PPSD) still has plans to use it.
“The City spends approximately $300,000 a year to maintain this vacant, dormant building, which will have an active school presence connected to it, adding to the building’s security risk,” Estrella said. 
Going forward, the costs for renovating and maintaining the building to PPSD’s liking will fall upon the district itself. PPSD spokesperson Suzanne Ouellette said in a Friday email the district is reassessing construction timelines in the aftermath of the lease’s rejection, as it wants to use the school as a temporary swing space for students of Asa Messer Elementary School before they can attend classes in a facility that’s still being built.
“In the short-term, PPSD will be responsible for bearing the full cost of utilities, custodial, and maintenance for the Lauro building versus sharing them with Excel,” Ouellette wrote — bad news amid a potential $5 million drop in federal funding, she added. 
In the longer-term, Ouellette said the district is now without lease revenue it meant to use in support of school facility upgrades across the city.
The old elementary school once accommodated up to 1,050 students, but overly pricey needed upgrades led the state-run district to close the Lauro School in 2023. Since then the unoccupied building has become a testing ground for sparring ideas about education in not just the capital city but the state itself. 
“This was a chance to say yes to students, to families, and to a smarter future for Providence,” Victor Capellan, founder and CEO of Rhode Island Education Collective and a former senior adviser to the state education department’s commissioner, said in a Friday morning statement. “Instead, we are left with a building that continues to drain public resources while children are denied better options.”

Excel Academy, which has four existing locations in Massachusetts and one in North Providence, would have occupied the building through 2035 under the lease agreement that councilors rejected Thursday. It would have shared the space with Asa Messer students for the first five years of the lease.
“Despite this disappointing outcome, our families and our community remain undeterred,” Owen Stearns, superintendent of Excel Academy, said in a statement Thursday night. 
According to the Rhode Island Education Collective, the lease would have generated more than $80 million in local investment over time from Excel’s rent payments, capital improvements, philanthropy, and neighborhood beautification.
The City Council has twice shot down proposals to lease the building to a charter school, which are publicly-funded schools that limit enrollment via a lottery system. The Rhode Island General Assembly increased the number of charter school operators allowed in the state to 35 in 2010, and Excel already has approval to expand from the Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE). 
Capellan’s former boss at RIDE — state education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green — has noted the big demand for charter schools among the city’s parents. Infante-Green cited in a 2024 interview with The 74 that 19,000 Providence children apply to charter schools out of 22,000 students in the district.
“As a mother and educator, the Commissioner believes in parents’ ability to choose the best educational experience that meets their needs and priorities,” Victor Morente, a RIDE spokesperson, wrote in a Friday email. “Both charters and traditional schools are public schools, and she represents all public schools.”
A U-turn on Kenyon Street deal
The school building is in the district represented by City Council President Rachel Miller, who negotiated the lease terms herself alongside Smiley, who also chairs the Excel Academy Rhode Island Board of Trustees. The upcoming agreement, Miller said in a July 17 statement, was carefully vetted and vastly improved upon the previous year’s proposal.
But Miller lost confidence in the lease on Wednesday evening, and announced in a statement that she would vote against it.
“The city council will not hand the keys of a shuttered public school building to a charter school,” Miller wrote. “We need to ensure that our public spaces are utilized in ways that reflect the needs of surrounding communities.”
The next day, Thursday, the Council met and voted 8-4 on the lease approval, with two abstentions and one absence.
Miller’s change of heart provoked the ire of a number of charter proponents who had campaigned for months to see the lease approved, including the Providence Republican City Committee. In a press release issued shortly after midnight Friday, the Providence GOP noted bussing Providence students to Excel’s North Providence location is costly, to the tune of an estimated $200,000 a year. Providence kids comprise 85% of the student body at the North Providence Excel, according to the group.   
Miller’s maneuver also wounded and confused Smiley, who learned of her decision via her announcement, after hearing rumors earlier in the day. He described Miller’s reversal as “baffling” at a Thursday morning press conference ahead of the council’s vote.  
“If she thinks that this is going to somehow provide additional resources for Providence Public Schools, it will not,” Smiley said. “This not only doesn’t move education forward in the city, it actually creates a bunch of new problems that PPSD is going to have to solve.”

High emotions over valuable real estate
Miller did not have any additional comment on the vote Friday morning. City Council spokesperson Marc Boyd said via email there was “nothing else to add right now beyond what was in Wednesday night’s statement.”
But Miller did have more to say online Wednesday, when Boston Globe political columnist Dan McGowan critiqued her second thoughts.
“This council can’t get out of its own way,” McGowan wrote.
Miller wrote back: “I don’t know Dan — it’s my job to put forward the best option I can and then listen. My neighbors opposed this — nearly 150 residents contacted me since — politicians don’t change their mind publicly because folks are unwilling to admit their way might not be the only way.”
More city councilors and Providence School Board members weighed in on social media, dissatisfied with McGowan’s assertion that Miller’s reneging was not the best look as the city works to take back its schools from state control.
“Well, if she reneged, she did it for the right reason,” Providence School Board President Ty’relle Stephens responded. “I’d call that an A+ reneging.”
Stephens had also scheduled a press conference outside City Hall earlier in the week to oppose the lease approval. The event was postponed because of “unforeseen circumstances,” according to an email from Stephens. But it would have included three school board members, one state representative, and two state senators from Providence, including Sen. Sam Bell, a Democrat who represents the district where the Lauro building resides. 
“It’s no small thing to get the council president to reverse her position and oppose a lease agreement she negotiated,” Bell said via text Friday, praising the council’s decision. 
The building is also in the district of Providence Democratic Rep. John J. Lombardi, who wrote via email Friday that he was still “trying to understand the backstory” of the building’s saga. 
Still, Lombardi, a former city council president who temporarily served as the city’s mayor from 2002 to 2003, said a public school is his preference for the space. But he added that a “hybrid” public-private venture, like apartments with social service programs attached, would be even more “ideal” for the city.
The building, Lombardi said, is “too valuable a real estate footprint to remain vacant.”

The Trump administration announced Friday that it was releasing the money, which totals billions nationwide and pays for English language instruction, adult literacy and teacher professional development, among other things. 
When the federal government announced its decision to “review” the grant funding on June 30, the original amount was more than $6 billion, including $68 million in Mississippi. Later, the Trump administration unfroze $1.3 billion in grants that pay for afterschool programs, which totaled about $17 million in Mississippi.
Since then, $51 million was still on hold in the state. 
The freeze had prompted lawsuits and calls from Congress, which appropriated the money in a bill signed this year by Trump, to release it. School districts in Mississippi were scrambling to deal with with the freeze at the eleventh hour, just weeks away from the start of school. 
Spokespeople for the Mississippi Department of Education said they received notice from the national education department on Friday afternoon about the grants. The funds will be awarded beginning July 28, the state agency said. 
“We are relieved to learn that the U.S. Department of Education will release the funds that Congress committed to states,” said Lance Evans, state superintendent of education, in an emailed statement. “These funds are essential to providing education services to the students of Mississippi.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/12171730/Stewpot-summer-camp-4.jpg,,,2025-07-25 17:58:10.418693

A new analysis released o Wednesday by the national left-leaning nonprofit think tank found that  during President Donald Trump’s first six months, federal agencies — primarily the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation — have canceled more than 4,000 grant awards worth an estimated $7 billion at over 600 colleges and universities across the country as of early July. Between $3.3 billion to $3.7 billion in research grants have been targeted. 
Data for the analysis was pulled from DOGE’s “Wall of Receipts,” U.S. Department of Health and Human Services list of terminated grants and the U.S. Treasury Department’s Bureau of Fiscal Spending. The report looks at terminated grants, not grants that were paused or “frozen,” according to the analysis. 
Mississippi colleges and universities could lose $32,513,961 in federal research grants and funding cuts under the Department of Government Efficiency, according to the report. Mississippi State University would take the biggest hit, losing more than $25.6 million.
Earlier this year, Mark Keenum, president of the university, penned a letter of concern over the federal administration’s executive order to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion efforts linked to research funding, student aid and other school operations, calling the potential loss “catastrophic” to the university. 
In a statement sent to Mississippi Today, Keenum said the institution has been working with state lawmakers and federal agency leaders to help recover funds that were threatened. 
“We are deeply appreciative of the help of our Mississippi congressional delegation as they work to preserve MSU research programs and ameliorate cuts to our institution’s benefit. U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith worked particularly hard on the Senate Appropriations Committee to win concessions for our outstanding Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Fish research,” Keenum said. “I am proud of the way our faculty, staff, and students remained focused and disciplined in their reactions to these challenges. Because of that, we continue to serve as our state’s premier research and development hub.” 
Terminating millions of dollars in research grants at universities could strip schools and their communities of resources and job opportunities, Greta Bedekovics, co-author of the analysis and associate director of democracy policy at the national think tank, said in a statement. 
“These data show that no institution, big or small, is safe from being targeted, and all states are suffering the consequences of cuts,” Bedekovics said. “The future success of many universities and colleges, their reputations, and their ability to attract talent is on the line.” 
Historically Black colleges and universities, as well as public land grant universities have also been affected, with more than two-thirds of all land grant universities and nearly half of HBCUs targeted for funding terminations, according to the report. 
The state has two land grant universities — Mississippi State University and Alcorn State University, the state’s oldest land grant university, which is targeted for $272,369 in cuts. Alcorn is also an HBCU, as is Mississippi’s Jackson State University targeted for $1,436,982 in cuts and Mississippi Valley State University with $59,962.

(Photo by Getty Images, board seal courtesy the State of Iowa) The former president of the medical staff at a Sioux City hospital has been sanctioned by the Iowa Board of Medicine for sexual harassment.
According to board records, Dr. Rick Colwell, 66, was employed by UnityPoint Health’s St. Luke’s Regional Medical Center in Sioux City prior to being placed on administrative leave in 2022.
The board says Colwell’s personnel file indicates that sometime prior to 2015, he had been warned for the use of profanity and “abusive or demeaning behavior toward nurses,” and for verbal aggression and confrontational behavior. The board alleges that Colwell then hired an entity called Out of the Woods Inc. “to address these concerns.”
About 18 months later, the board says, Colwell was elected president of the medical staff at the Sioux City hospital, where he also served on the hospital’s board of directors.
In his role as medical staff president, one of Colwell’s “core duties” was to resolve issues involving inappropriate or unacceptable behavior by the medical staff, the board alleges.
At some unspecified point, the board alleges, UnityPoint Health fielded a complaint that Colwell had made sexually suggestive comments that made the complainant uncomfortable. An internal investigation allegedly concluded Colwell had violated UnityPoint Health’s sexual harassment policy by creating a hostile work environment.
According to the board, the hospital placed Colwell on administrative leave on Feb. 11, 2022. Three weeks later, on March 2, 2022, the board alleges, Colwell resigned prior to the conclusion of an internal investigation.
Board records indicate Colwell now works in emergency medicine as an as an independent contractor for Floyd Valley Hospital in Le Mars.
Earlier this month, as a result of the 2022 allegations, the Iowa Board of Medicine charged Colwell with sexual harassment. Colwell denied the allegations but agreed to a settlement that places his license on probation for one year subject to certain conditions.
As part of the settlement, Colwell will be required to complete a program for “distressed physicians” and submit to worksite monitoring by an individual who will meet periodically with Colwell and review his patient charts if needed. During his probation, Colwell is to continue seeing a mental health therapist who will supply the board with reports on a regular basis, according to the settlement.
The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Colwell for comment on Friday.



Other Iowa-licensed doctors sanctioned
Other Iowa physicians recently sanctioned by the Board of Medicine include:
— Dr. Theron Q. Jameson, an Iowa-licensed orthopedic medicine physician who works in the Des Moines area. The board alleges it has received information indicating that Jameson, at some unspecified time in the past, “behaved in an inappropriate and unprofessional manner, including sharing inappropriate details about his personal life and making both sexual and derogatory comments about and towards coworkers.”
Jameson has denied the allegations but agreed to a settlement that calls for him to complete training and educational courses on professional boundaries and medical ethics. As part of the settlement, he is also required to pay a $5,000 civil penalty, complete a multidisciplinary fitness-for-duty assessment, and comply with any recommendations as a result of that assessment.
— Dr. Gautam Jayaswal, who pleaded guilty to a felony criminal charge of conspiracy in 2023.  According to federal prosecutors, Jayaswal was an emergency medicine physician licensed in Iowa and at least seven other states when he contracted with Barton & Associates and 11 other companies that provide medical goods and services for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.
Through those companies, Jayaswal allegedly ordered medically unnecessary products and services for thousands of telemedicine patients, including orthotic braces for 1,433 patients at a cost of $1.3 million. Medicare was also billed for $14.7 million for unnecessary genetic tests Jayaswal ordered for 2,000 of his telemedicine “patients,” prosecutors alleged.
Court records show that immediately after he was charged, Jayaswal pleaded guilty to conspiracy, a crime punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine of $250,000. His sentencing has been delayed several times since May 2023 and is now scheduled for Sept. 4, 2025.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DOCTOR.jpg,,,2025-07-25 17:58:10.418693
,California,2025-07-25 21:26:46+00:00,CalMatters,Trump’s crackdown on homelessness: What does it mean for California?,Marisa Kendall,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/homelessness/2025/07/trump-homelessness-executive-order/,Trump’s call to enforce bans on encampments echoes Newsom’s policy. But the president wants to upend two other core tenants of California’s homelessness response.,"In summary
Trump’s call to enforce bans on encampments echoes Newsom’s policy. But the president wants to upend two other core tenants of California’s homelessness response.


President Donald Trump’s new law-and-order approach to homelessness bears several striking resemblances to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s.
Trump wants cities to enforce laws that make it illegal for homeless people to sleep outside. So does Newsom. 
Trump threatened to withhold funding from places that don’t. So did Newsom. 
And the president wants to make it easier to force homeless people living with serious mental illness or addiction into treatment. So does Newsom. 
It’s rare for Trump and Newsom, typically adversaries, to see eye to eye on anything. But when the president signed an executive order this week pushing cities and states to use law enforcement to get unhoused people off the streets, some of it read like déjà vu to Californians. 
“I don’t know that there’s a huge contrast between parts of this order and what winds are already blowing toward in California,” said Ryan Finnigan, deputy director of research for the UC Berkeley Terner Center for Housing Innovation.
But Trump doesn’t want to stop at banning homeless encampments and pushing people into treatment, and that’s where he and Newsom diverge: The president wants to upend two core tenets of California’s homelessness policy.
Trump wants to abolish federal support for “housing first,” which is the idea that homeless individuals should get housing even if they are still using drugs, and “harm reduction,” which focuses on preventing overdoses and otherwise making drug use safer.
Both tenets are backed by research and have been the gold standard in California — and at the federal level — for years
The threat of abandoning those philosophies has left local service providers scrambling to figure out whether they’ll have to change how they’ve helped homeless Californians for years or risk losing out on federal funds. 
“For all of that to be upended, the entire structure of service delivery is going to be turned upside down,” said John Maceri, CEO of The People Concern, a nonprofit that serves unhoused people in Los Angeles.
More of the same in California?
Trump’s executive order, titled “Ending crime and disorder on America’s streets,” seeks to prioritize funding for states and cities that enforce bans on open drug use, camping, loitering and squatting. It also orders the Attorney General to make federal funds available for removing encampments in places where state and local resources aren’t enough. 
The order comes a year after the U.S. Supreme Court removed protections for people living on the streets in California and other western states, ruling cities can ban camping even if they have no shelter beds.
Newsom already was pressuring cities to crack down on homeless encampments long before Trump’s order. In May, he urged every city in the state to pass an ordinance making it illegal to camp on public property. As an example of how this should be done, he released a model ordinance that would make it illegal to camp in one place for more than three nights in a row, block streets or sidewalks and build semi-permanent structures. 
But Newsom was quick to distance himself from Trump’s policies.
“Like so many of Trump’s executive orders, this order is more focused on creating distracting headlines and settling old scores than producing any positive impact,” spokesperson Tara Gallegos said in an emailed statement. “But, his imitation (even poorly executed) is the highest form of flattery.”
Some experts say Trump, who has a history of holding funding hostage over perceived slights, could use his new executive order as a way to cut off money to California. 
The order doesn’t specify exactly what compliance looks like, Finnigan said. At least 50 California cities have banned homeless encampments in the past year, according to a study by UC Berkeley researchers. But if homelessness doesn’t decrease in a way Trump is satisfied with, the president could accuse California of failing to enforce those laws and cut the state’s funding, Finnigan said. 
That threat comes as the Trump administration already is cutting funds for homeless services, affordable housing and Medicaid. 
Trump’s order also prioritizes committing more people to institutions from the street. The order seeks to make it easier to commit people with mental illness who can’t care for themselves, while also promising grants and other assistance to help ramp up commitments, and threatening to divert funding away from places that don’t push people into treatment facilities “to the maximum extent permitted by law.” It also promises to prioritize funding to expand mental health courts and drug courts. 
Newsom, too, has made it a priority to get people living with mental illness and addiction out of encampments and into treatment — without their consent, if necessary. His CARE Court program, which went live in all 58 counties at the end of last year, allows judges to put people into mental health and addiction treatment plans, but stops short of allowing judges to force compliance. Newsom also supported a 2023 law that expanded who could be forced into treatment under a conservatorship. 
Trump’s order prompted a backlash from groups that support the civil rights of people with mental illnesses and disabilities. The National Alliance on Mental Health, which maintains that forced treatment should be used as a last resort, said Trump’s order raises “grave concerns.” Disability Rights California, which also opposed CARE Court, said Trump’s order goes a step beyond what California is already doing.
“The playbook looks similar,” said Greg Cramer, associate director of public policy. “But I think the consequences of the Trump action go even further.”
But the order doesn’t include funding for new mental health or addiction treatment beds. In a state already struggling with a lack of resources, some experts said Trump’s order for more forced treatment feels hollow.
“Even if they agreed to go into treatment, where are these facilities that they’re supposed to go into?” Maceri asked. 
No more housing first
In ending federal support for housing first and harm reduction strategies to fight homelessness, Trump’s order ends years of precedent. California has long practiced housing first, which means everyone is entitled to housing, even if they have an untreated mental illness or are using drugs. The idea is that it’s much easier to receive treatment or get clean while housed than it is on the street. 
Instead, Trump wants people in federal housing programs to have to submit to substance abuse treatment or mental health services as a condition of participation. His order also stops federal funding for harm reduction. 
The People Concern, which provides street outreach and runs permanent housing, offers the opiate overdose reversing drug Narcan to its clients. It gives out antiseptic wipes to help people who inject drugs avoid dangerous infections, and it doesn’t evict tenants just because they are using drugs. 
The organization also refers people to treatment programs. But not everyone is ready for that, Maceri said. The harm reduction strategies help build trust — and keep people safe — until they are ready to get clean, he said. 
The People Concern, like many nonprofits, uses state and private funds — not federal dollars — to pay for harm reduction services. 
But Trump’s order directs the Attorney General to review whether organizations that get federal funds and also “knowingly distribute drug paraphernalia” or “permit the use of distribution of illicit drugs” on their property are violating federal law – and bring civil or criminal actions against them if so. 
That could mean groups like The People Concern have to change their practices.
“If it goes that far,” Maceri said, “I’m certainly not going to put our staff or our clients in legal jeopardy.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/032223_SD_Encampment-Ban_KC_CM_05.jpg?fit=1024%2C676&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-25 17:58:10.418693

(Photo via Google Earth) A surgeon is suing an eastern Iowa county hospital, alleging officials there discriminated against her on the basis of gender, fired her and then falsely reported she had resigned.
Dr. Beth Hothan-Zielinski of Henry County is suing Jefferson County Health Center of Fairfield in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa based on a civil rights complaint she filed against the hospital in November 2024.
According to the lawsuit, the hospital hired Hothan-Zielinski as a general surgeon in April 2013. For the next 11 years, the lawsuit claims, Hothan-Zielinski performed her job and, for most of that time, was the only general surgeon at the hospital.
In November 2021, the lawsuit alleges, the hospital hired Dr. Scott Stoeger as a second general surgeon. Stoeger left Jefferson County in November 2023, and in September 2024,  Hothan-Zielinski allegedly learned that the hospital had paid him far more than her to do the same job.
The lawsuit claims that while Stoeger graduated medical school in 2013, Hothan-Zielinski had been a practicing general surgeon for 38 years, and yet Stoeger had a base pay of $480,000 per year, which was $105,000 more Hothan-Zielinski was paid.
Stoeger had no experience, education, skill or additional board certification that would have justified the pay difference, the lawsuit claims. It goes on to allege that the hospital “did not negotiate at all” the terms for Stoeger’s pay, offering him $480,000 and a $20,000 signing bonus, as well as an annual payment toward student loans, plus a $6,000 annual retention bonus for five years.
Hothan-Zielinski alleges she was never offered a signing bonus or a retention bonus.
The lawsuit goes on to allege that Jefferson County Health Center gives surgeons bonuses based on a formula using Relative Value Units, or RVUs, which are intended to reflect a physician’s volume of work and level of effort in treating patients. Typically, the more RVUs a physician generates, the greater the revenue for the hospital and the physician.
On Sept. 11, 2024, the lawsuit claims, hospital CEO Bryan Hunger told Hothan-Zielinski her contract was not being renewed for 2025. “Dr. Hothan-Zielinski was shocked,” the lawsuit alleges, adding that Hunger later attributed the decision to her “productivity.”
The lawsuit states that Hothan-Zielinski then “gave a large file with her surgery figures” to the hospital’s governing board and “fought for her job” during a public meeting, arguing that the hospital was incorrect in its calculation of her RVUs.
“The board fired her anyway,” the lawsuit alleges. “The meeting minutes claimed Dr. Hothan-Zielinski resigned. That was false; Dr. Hothan-Zielinski never resigned.”
The lawsuit alleges violations of the Iowa Civil Rights Act’s provisions on gender, sex discrimination and pay discrimination, as well as violations of the Equal Pay Act of 1963. It is seeking compensatory damages for lost wages, as well as tripled damages due to the discrimination involved.
The hospital has yet to file a response to the lawsuit, which was filed in state court last month before being transferred to federal court this week. The hospital’s spokesperson and its attorneys in the case could not be reached for comment Friday afternoon.

In a letter to the DOJ, Justin Erickson, Simon’s general counsel, writes that the secretary of state’s office “will require clear legal justification for the data and sufficient information to show that the data will be protected and used properly before it can consider whether it is appropriate to share Minnesota’s voter registration list.”
The letter is addressed to Maureen Riordan, acting chief, voting section of the DOJ.
As Stateline reported recently, the DOJ is seeking the voter registration lists of Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin  — representing data on millions of Americans — and other election information ahead of the 2026 midterms, raising fears about how the Trump administration plans to use the information.


Erickson writes that the Trump administration hasn’t provided “any legal basis in its June 25 letter that would entitle it to Minnesota’s voter registration list.”
The Star Tribune was first to report Simon’s response Friday.
Other states recently received emails from a DOJ official asking for meetings to discuss information-sharing agreements.
As Stateline reported, the DOJ’s focus on elections comes after President Donald Trump directed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in March to seek information about suspected election crimes from state election officials and empowered her to potentially withhold grants and other funds from uncooperative states.

Grassley-led Judiciary Committee advances controversial U.S. attorney picks
Chairman Grassley voted alongside committee Republicans to advance all seven nominations for U.S. attorneys. 
In his opening statement, he referred to all U.S. attorney hopefuls as “highly qualified nominees.”
The committee voted along party lines to advance Pirro, a former Fox News host, to an influential seat as lead federal prosecutor for the District of Columbia. 
This decision was criticized during remarks by ranking member Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, who said: “Ms. Pirro’s fealty to President Trump extends to attacking any lawmaker who is not fully in line with his MAGA agenda, including many members on both sides of the aisle. Ms. Pirro’s record makes it clear that she will prioritize President Trump’s MAGA agenda, not the rule of law nor the Constitution.”
Minority party members Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut voted nay for all seven nominations.
Iowa Democrats criticize early House shutdown
Following tensions over Jeffrey Epstein’s case files, House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, announced legislative operations would be cut short on July 23.
The decision prompted criticism from Iowa Democrats, who released a list of questions for Iowa’s House delegation — stating they “have a lot to answer for.”
The list includes several targeted questions that criticize the delegates’ decision to pass the “big, beautiful bill” and their decision to end the session without addressing Iowa’s struggling economy. 
The group referenced a release from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which “in real, inflation adjusted terms” determined that Iowa’s economy contracted 6.1% in the first quarter of 2025, placing the state’s economy in 49th place overall compared to other states. 
“We’ve had over eight years of Republican rule, and nothing to show for it but farms that are now facing bankruptcy, struggling rural hospitals, and public schools that don’t know if they’ll have the funds to see tomorrow. Iowa needs change, ” said Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart.
Members of Iowa’s all-red federal delegation indicated they were supportive of releasing the Epstein case files but current congressional efforts are being used by Democrats for political gain.
Ernst seeks to ‘clear’ environmental regulations for unnavigable water sources
Ernst introduced a new bill to make permanent exclusions to sources of water that can be regulated by the “Waters Of The United States” rule.
The CLEAR act seeks to permanently ban regulation for “covered water features that do not interact with navigable waters.” A press release from Ernst’s office argued this would clarify that “waste treatment systems, temporary streams from rain, and groundwater are not navigable waterways.”
Congressional ag panel hears ‘implications’ of California livestock confinement law

“WOTUS regulatory uncertainty has threatened the livelihoods of hardworking Iowa farmers, small businesses, and landowners for far too long, and I was thrilled to join EPA Administrator (Lee) Zeldin in announcing that the Trump administration is revising this misguided and harmful regulatory expansion,” Ernst said in the release. “After leading this fight for a decade, I am making it CLEAR that the federal government has no businesses regulating cooling ponds, municipal treatment plants, groundwater, and streams that only flow after rainfall under WOTUS.”
The bill received criticism from Food & Water Watch Legal Director Tarah Heinzen, who commented: “Iowa’s waterways are awash in pesticides and nitrate-laden factory farm waste – and it is one of just two states with increasing cancer rates. We can only achieve clean water and protect public health through commonsense regulation of the state’s largest polluters — industrial agriculture. This bill only takes things backwards. The only thing ‘clear’ from Joni Ernst’s crusade against clean water protections is that she represents the interests of Big Ag, not Iowans.”
Grassley seeks to bolster whistleblower protections
Grassley cosponsored a bill with Sen. Gary Peters, a Democrat from Michigan, to expand whistleblower protections. The act seeks to “close existing loopholes in whistleblower protection law” by clarifying that a nondisclosure agreement or “other conditions of employment” can’t be used to waive whistleblower protections.
“Whistleblowers working for federal contractors and subcontractors shouldn’t face retaliation for sounding the alarm on waste, fraud and abuse. These patriots are critical in safeguarding Americans’ tax dollars,” Grassley said in a press release. “As a long-time advocate for whistleblowers, I’m glad to sponsor this legislation to strengthen protections for whistleblowers and close the loopholes that have allowed retaliation.”
Grassley also called upon the Trump administration Friday to identify federal employees who were terminated after making a protected whistleblower disclosure. In his letter to the Oval Office, he requested that each case be individually reviewed for violations of protected disclosure and to ensure they were not part of the “Reduction in Force initiative.”
 Nunn-led bill to increase financial pressure on Kremlin-linked banks passes committee

The House Financial Services Committee voted to pass Rep. Zach Nunn’s PEACE act to tighten sanctions on foreign banks linked to the ongoing war in Ukraine.
The bill includes mandatory sanctions for banks engaged in transactions with Russian entities, a “sunset clause” to maintain sanctions on Russia’s “destabilizing activities in Ukraine.” The bill also stipulates a “narrow presidential waiver with Congressional oversight to ensure flexibility without undermining enforcement.”
“Words alone won’t stop Putin’s aggression—cutting off the money will,” Nunn stated in a press release. “As a combat veteran and intelligence officer, I’ve seen firsthand how financial pressure can be used to stop violence before it escalates. This bill delivers a clear message: if you’re bankrolling Putin’s war machine, you will pay the price. I’m proud to see it move forward with bipartisan support.”

Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia MercurySpecial tax credits that help people purchase health insurance are set to expire later this year if Congress doesn’t renew them. Virginia lawmakers are planning ahead should the credits lapse and trying to understand the ripple effects the loss would spur in the state.
Federal lawmakers didn’t take action to renew them when passing a reconciliation bill this summer (which will adjust other healthcare affordability measures in the future), leaving state lawmakers wondering how and if they will be able to make up for lost federal assistance. 
Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, sent a letter to Virginia’s insurance commissioner this week asking for an “urgent analysis” of how Virginians would be affected if the credits expire. 
About 400,000 Virginians purchase health insurance through the state’s exchange, and some of those people qualify for and use the enhanced premium tax credits that Congress created in 2021 and extended in 2022. The credits are meant to apply to people that earn between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level. 
Surovell is trying to determine not only how many people might face higher prices and decide to forego health care coverage for themselves if the credits disappear, but also if some insurers might feel inclined to leave the ACA Marketplace. 
This summer, Aetna announced plans to withdraw from the Affordable Care Act marketplace at the end of the year. The ACA marketplace was established by a 15-year-old federal law that allows people without employer-provided health care to purchase their own. Then, associated tax credits help further offset those costs, which is particularly helpful for low or middle-income earners. The Mercury asked if the uncertainty of enhanced premium tax credits’ fate were a factor, but Aetna representatives neither confirmed nor denied.
Certain Aetna health insurance plans leaving the Affordable Care Act marketplace next year

Just as Aetna has let customers know they will need to look elsewhere for coverage in 2026 onward, health care associations caution that people will start considering their options by the fall. 
Multiple associations — including those representing insurance companies —  recently sent a joint letter to members of Congress to try to persuade skeptics or opponents. 
“By October, millions of Americans will be ‘window shopping’ and see the full extent of these soaring premiums for 2026,” the joint letter said. “And already, many of the 24 million people enrolled in the individual market are receiving letters informing them that to maintain their coverage they will need to find hundreds or thousands of dollars in already stretched family budgets.”
While not all of the tax credits will go away in December, it’s the enhanced premium tax credits that reach further to those who need it that are at risk. If Congress lets them expire, credits would revert to pre-2021 levels and fewer people would qualify for them.
Virginia Health Benefit Exchange director Keven Patchett told lawmakers last week that an estimated 100,000 Virginians could fall off their insurance due to the cost. He also estimated that out-of-pocket premiums could rise 30% to 50% in January of next year.  
Representatives for the Exchange further confirmed the 100,000 figure Friday afternoon. The Bureau of Insurance also plans to provide presentations on proposed average changes to rates “as submitted by carriers” for 2026 that will be posted to the State Corporation Commission’s website on Aug. 7.
But loss of health care has consequences beyond the people who lose it, Julian Walker with the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association has also warned. 
In a recent conversation with the Mercury, he explained that people without health insurance are more likely to put off preventative care or seek treatment for conditions until emergencies arise. Emergencies are when costs of treatment also tend to be higher and hospitals must treat patients regardless of their payment or insurance status, per federal law. 
So, they end up absorbing the costs that they then sometimes seek to offset. As hospitals periodically negotiate with private insurers, rates could go up for employers and employees with private health insurance. 
With potential changes or tough choices about health insurance in the near future, Surovell told the Mercury he believes state lawmakers may “need to act on this in the next two months or so.”
Whether that means calling lawmakers back to the Capitol for a special session remains unclear, just like the future of the credits.
With Congress breaking for the summer, federal lawmakers could decide to take action on the credits later this year. The lack of addressing the credits in congress’ recent reconciliation bill could hint at their unlikely renewal, but some Republicans are split on preserving them. 
Virginia Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, was not available for an interview Friday and has yet to make a statement on the possibility of a special session to address the matter. 
There’s also $900 million Virginia has reserved to use as needed. When finalizing state budget amendments earlier this year, Gov. Glenn Youngkin chose to hold onto part of the state’s surplus as “cushion” for federal actions by Congress and President Donald Trump. 
A spokesperson for Youngkin did not follow through by the time of this publication when asked how much of the surplus he suspects the legislature could tap into for health care and if the governor would welcome it. By January next year, however, Virginia will have a new governor who could steer conversations with legislative leaders on how to spend or not spend the surplus. 
In the meantime, Virginia House Health and Human Services committee chair Del. Mark Sickles, D-Fairfax, is watching federal matters closely to see if lawmakers might need to assemble before the year’s end or wait to address things in their 2026 session. 
The idea of a special session is a “maybe,” he shared in a text message. No decision has been made yet by Democrats, who control both Virginia’s House and Senate chambers. 
“I need to find out how much it would cost to replicate recent results or produce something less useful but still worthwhile, ” Sickles said.

(Photo by Ylleana Berryhill/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — State officials on Friday celebrated the 35th anniversary of the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which they said continues to change Oklahomans’ lives for the better.
More than 100 people gathered at the Oklahoma History Center to celebrate the passage of the act and to discuss its impact on their lives and how far the state has come since its passage.
“It truly reshaped our communities, workplaces and public spaces for the better, both in rural and urban areas,” Lt. Gov. Matt Pinnell said. 
The civil rights law, signed by former President George H. W. Bush in 1990, prevents individuals with disabilities from facing discrimination. It mandates that employers must provide equal access to opportunities. It also requires governmental entities and businesses that are open to the public to provide accommodations for people with disabilities.
In 2023, 17% of Oklahomans reported having a disability, according to WHO. 
Nancy Ward, an advocate for disability rights, recalled when the law was first introduced. At the time, she was the self-advocacy coordinator for People First of Nebraska, which focuses on issues impacting disabled residents.
“At the time, the first version of the ADA had been introduced in Congress, but it mostly talked about the rights of people with physical disabilities. I realized that it didn’t really say much about people like me, people who have intellectual disabilities,” Ward said. “I knew we had to do something to change that.”
Ward retired after working for two decades at the Oklahoma Disability Law Center. At the time the law was passed, she said she, as well as a few other advocates, went from office to office in Washington D.C. to share their stories and discuss why the Americans with Disabilities Act was important. She said the act gave people an equal opportunity to live and work in their communities.
“It’s also important to remember that the ADA has always had support from both Republicans and Democrats because anyone can have a disability.” Ward said. “It doesn’t matter what party you’re in.”
Rep. John Pfeiffer, R-Mulhall, said changes were made to his school that impacted not just his brother, who was injured in a car collision, but for generations of students to come. He said the act guarantees everyone has access to the tools they need for success. 
Rep. Ellyn Hefner, D-Oklahoma City, said the federal law “did not just change buildings. It changed lives.” 
She said it gave individuals the opportunity to pursue the American dream, and that the passage of the law showed that “disability rights are not partisan. 
“They are human rights,” she said.",https://oklahomavoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7250135-1024x670.jpg,,,2025-07-25 16:56:39.583847

(Photo courtesy of Avangrid)With Massachusetts toying with the idea of procuring offshore wind energy from Canada, officials in Maine say they are keeping an eye on opportunities across the border as local development has been stalled.
In the first few days of his second term, President Donald Trump hit the breaks on new wind energy development by pausing all new federal permits for on or offshore projects. Just days before, the Maine Governor’s Energy Office released its strategic plan to provide affordable and reliable energy, while also meeting the state’s climate goals. The plan calls for a mix of clean energy sources, but is largely predicated on a goal to develop offshore wind in the Gulf of Maine.
Meanwhile, the latest federal tax bill created another roadblock for the clean energy industry by phasing out the tax credits for solar and wind projects that aren’t in service by the end of 2027.
Like Maine, Massachusetts is trying to shift its power mix to sustainable sources and has a statutory goal to lock in contracts for at least 5,600 megawatts of offshore wind by 2027. It has one project under construction that’s expected to be completed by the end of the year, but it won’t be enough to meet that objective. 
That’s why Massachusetts’s Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs is potentially looking to procure electricity from planned offshore wind farms in Canada — news first reported by Canada’s National Observer last month.
While turning north of the border won’t be without its own challenges, Massachusetts state Sen. Michael Barrett called it a “creative solution” and said he would work to extend the statutory deadline so the state can pursue this route. 
“This becomes a serious possibility for the mid-term and the long-term,” Barrett told CommonWealth Beacon. “It isn’t a short-term substitution for the damage that President Trump is doing to our current offshore wind projects, but there’s a lot of promise here.” 
The Governor’s Energy Office in Maine didn’t dismiss the idea. The office told Maine Morning Star that it is working with New England and Canadian partners to advance shared energy goals. 
“We’re closely tracking the development of offshore wind in Canada and considering how regional efforts may deliver reliable, affordable power, modern infrastructure, and broad economic benefits for Maine,” the office said in a statement Friday. 
Other proponents are divided 
Though Maine faces the same domestic roadblocks from the Trump administration, it has a longer statutory runway than Massachusetts. State law outlines a goal to develop 3,000 megawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2040. 
Given that timeline, Jack Shapiro, climate and clean energy director for the Natural Resources Council of Maine, said it’s probably too early for the state to procure energy from Canadian projects to achieve its offshore wind goals. Building a new industry was always going to require long-term planning and, unlike Massachusetts, Maine’s statutory timeline goes well beyond Trump’s term, he added. 
“We’ve got a long way to go before I think we need to give up on the idea of building an offshore wind industry for Maine, given how much we know about the economic benefits that will come along with that,” Shapiro said. 
Could Canadian offshore wind help meet New England’s climate goals?

Constructing a port to build floating offshore wind platforms could support more than 6,000 jobs during construction and an average of nearly 1,000 jobs annually through 2050 for a total economic benefit to the state of $6.6 billion, according to an economic impact analysis conducted by Karp Strategies on behalf of the Natural Resources Council of Maine. Proponents also say this would provide a new industry to anchor the local economy.
Rather than turn to Canada, Shapiro said the state can use the remainder of the Trump administration to continue researching the budding technology so that when the roadblocks clear it will be ready to keep moving forward on domestic offshore wind projects.  
Alternately, some argue that supporting Canadian projects would allow the industry to continue to advance and innovate so that when the political environment is more favorable, Maine and its workers would benefit. 
Cheyenne Gallivan, communications director for the Maine Labor Climate Council, said if New England states buying offshore wind power from Canada could jumpstart the industry, it’s worth considering. 
“We, of course, want Maine workers to be domestically producing our energy, but at a time when the federal and political environment is not amenable to our development of that homegrown offshore wind, we don’t see working with Canada as something that would hinder,” Gallivan said.
Though Maine workers would more easily benefit from domestic projects, workers who are citizens of tribal nations or members of international labor unions could theoretically work on projects in Canada, noted Grant Provost, business agent for Ironworkers Local 7 and vice president of the Maine AFL-CIO. But he added those dynamics could be complicated by current trade tensions. 
Pointing out that part of northern Maine is already intertwined with the electrical grid in New Brunswick, Provost said strengthening the regional market would benefit everyone.
“It’s better to have an industry move forward in an area so that it can grow to the whole northeast, at the end of the day, as opposed to not having that happen and then starting from scratch again in three and a half, four years,” Provost said.
While the future of Maine’s wind industry is dependent on who next occupies the White House, Gallivan said the next governor of Maine will also need to commit to developing offshore wind. The current governor, Janet Mills, will be termed out by the end of 2026. 
While Democrats in Maine, including Mills, are largely supportive of the state’s energy goals and the development of offshore wind, in particular, Republican legislators wrote a letter to Trump thanking him for his action on offshore wind and asking him to take it a step further by revoking the existing leases and permits in the Gulf of Maine. They argued it puts Maine’s fishing industry at risk, but the lease areas outlined by the federal government already avoid a vital fishing area.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan has raised $3.2 million over the last six months in his independent Michigan gubernatorial campaign, nearly matching the eye-popping fundraising efforts of his biggest potential rival in the Democratic Party and far ahead of his Republican opponents.
Duggan’s campaign on Friday announced that the mayor, who started the year with just $58,000 in his campaign coffers, is now flush with cash. Much of that was raised within the last three months, his campaign said in a news release.
That leaves Duggan with $2.3 million cash on hand with a little more than a year until November 2026.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe mayor was a longtime Democrat who stumped for his party relentlessly before deciding to run as an independent candidate for governor, which has rankled operatives on both sides of the political aisle.
His fundraising announcement came just a day after Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, announced that she has raised $3.5 million within the same period, outpacing all candidates.
But Duggan was still upbeat and grateful for the support he was getting from religious leaders, business groups, and disaffected Democrats and Republicans alike.
“Every place I go, the fundraising crowds are huge, but we started out with a disadvantage of not having party infrastructure,” Duggan said Friday in an interview with Michigan Advance. “We didn’t have a portal to take donations. We were using PayPal at first, we didn’t have a donor list, we didn’t have statewide networks, and it took us three months, basically, to build the infrastructure from scratch. And we raised this $3 million basically in the last three months.”
Duggan said his campaign had 30 fundraisers in 90 days, and that those events saw supporters and interested voters bringing friends and neighbors with them. After hearing him speak, Duggan said those plus-one attendees later hosted events for him, too.
“One after another, it just kept snowballing,” Duggan said. “We’ll have to see what Benson’s numbers look like as far as transfers in and raising when they’re disclosed, but I don’t think anybody predicted that I would outraise all the Republicans and be right there at the top of the list.”
As an independent candidate outside of the two-party framework, Duggan will not have to face an opponent in a grueling primary.
Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II, Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson and former Cape Coral, Fla., Mayor Marni Sawicki are seeking the Democratic nomination for governor.
On the Republican side, U.S. Rep. John James of Shelby Township, former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox, current state Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt and former Michigan House Speaker Tom Leonard are seeking their party’s nomination.
When asked what his fundraising numbers say about his ability to compete with the eventual party nominees, Duggan said his moves and endorsements thus far have been a shock to both parties.
“When 160 African American ministers came out and endorsed me, I know that was a shock to the Democratic Party, and you see in the most recent polls that I’m going to win Detroit by a huge number,” Duggan said, adding that several unions were also lining up behind him. “Then to get the business community in the greater Detroit chamber. We’re building a coalition of people who are just fed up with politics in Lansing.”
Party politics in the Michigan Legislature have ground the institution to a halt, and budget negotiations have hit a brick wall. The Legislature failed to meet its statutory budget deadline of July 1, and as the month comes to a close, a deal is nowhere in sight.
Democrats in the Michigan House and Senate have pointed fingers at Republican House leadership for failing to get a general budget deal done while it focused on road funding with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, and its controversial K-12 and higher education budgets.
Republicans in both chambers have cast blame on their Democratic colleagues for not devising a road funding plan first before passing their education and general government spending plans, which Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) has said was the key setback.
The Senate’s top Democrat in the appropriations process told the Advance this month that it can’t begin to fathom a roads plan until it sees all the Republican cards on the full budget for government spending.
‘I can’t punch air’: budget chasm continues as Michigan Legislature fails to hold session

Adding to the chaos were the defections of some House Republicans, absent during Thursday’s session – in protest of Hall not taking their priorities seriously. The absences prevented the chamber from passing basic policy bills.
A blame game also erupted Thursday over alleged deals that were made – and then broken – to get Democratic votes on those bills before they died on the House floor. A key Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, state Rep. Alabas Farhat of Dearborn, voted no against one of the bills addressing new sentencing guidelines to circumvent the Michigan Supreme Court’s ruling on life without parole sentences for 19- and 20-year-olds. Hall said they had an agreement for Democratic votes, but Farhat said they were just mere discussions.
Either way, the breakdown moved Hall to strip Farhat of his post as minority vice chair of the appropriations committee.
In the aftermath, Duggan said Friday that his campaign was the potential antidote to that mess.
“They can’t get anything done because Republicans and Democrats are so consumed with fighting with each other,” Duggan said. “And whenever they fight with each other, they all send out letters to their donors, saying ‘send me money, I’m fighting with the other side.’ That works for a couple of narrow segments of people, but most people in this state, they actually want problems solved.”
Farhat ousted from key budget post amid GOP standoff and failed Michigan House votes

Derrick Honeyman, a spokesperson for the Michigan Democratic Party, pushed back against Duggan’s fundraising efforts, claiming that the mayor “has always been for sale to the highest bidder, including corporate special interests and big billionaires.”
“Now, Duggan wants to put Michigan up for sale during his ego-driven vanity campaign,” Honeyman said. “From being at the beck and holler of corporate special interests, to courting the support of people like Elon Musk and Andrew Yang, Mike Duggan is only in this race to put himself and his wealthy friends first, not the people of Michigan.”
As for the Republicans in the race, Cox on Friday reported that he’s raised $2.4 million over the last six months with $1.9 million cash on hand.
Nesbitt said he raised $2.3 million with $1.9 million cash on hand.
James, who is facing headwinds from President Donald Trump and Republicans at home to drop out of the race, reported raising $7 million – but two Lansing political news and policy publications have reported that those numbers were off.
Gongwer News Service, a Lansing-based political newsletter, reported that James’ campaign only raised $2.3 million with a $750,000 transfer from his congressional committee.
Bridge Michigan also noted that the $7 million was a culmination of an additional $5 million from the wealthy DeVos family that was given to a political action committee supporting his run for governor.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AMR_0052-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-25 16:56:39.583847

State […],"Louisiana State Police have made a fee for requesting video footage from body and dashboard cameras permanent. (Raymond Clark images)The fee Louisiana State Police charges to the public to provide video footage from body cameras and vehicle dashboards is now permanent after being applied temporarily for the past year. 
The law enforcement agency requires $10 for video recordings 20 minutes or less and 50 cents more for every additional minute beyond that timeframe. State police had been using this fee schedule for a year through an emergency declaration and adopted it permanently through a new government rule published last week. 
The fees also apply to any video footage state police releases from a third-party security camera. 
Body and dashboard camera footage is often sought when law enforcement officers are suspected of wrongdoing, such as using excessive force during an arrest or motor vehicle stop. The videos can also be used to clear an officer of misconduct allegations.

Louisiana State Police reported an uptick in video records requests. In 2024, it received 980 public records requests for body-worn camera footage. The average number of videos per request was four, according to a state financial analysis of the rule. 
State troopers started wearing body cameras in 2017, and the increase in requests followed the release of footage in 2021 that made national headlines when the Associated Press reported on its contents. Those videos taken in 2019 showed troopers beating motorist Ronald Greene and restraining him face down on a Northeast Louisiana roadside. Initially, state police claimed Greene, who was Black, died instantly after hitting a tree during a high-speed car chase. 

The footage made it clear Greene was not dead and, in fact, pleading for mercy from the troopers after the crash. He only went limp and became unresponsive several minutes after the troopers shackled him. 
It’s unclear what state police had been charging the public for its video footage before 2024. Capt. Russell Graham, a spokesman for the agency, said the fees were likely “inconsistent” across the state when asked about the previous rates. 

“There has been an increase in records requests for dashcam and bodycam footage, and this does take a considerable amount of time and effort on the part of our agency,” Graham said in email Thursday. “Personnel have to review every second of every video that is a responsive record.”
Graham said the software used to review the video and to make redactions when required also costs the agency money. 
“While these fees do not recoup all of the funds expended, it was determined to be a reasonable and appropriate amount to defer the costs,” he wrote.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/16087811409_6949ee5840_b.jpg,,,2025-07-25 15:57:01.343359

(NIOSH | Courtesy photo)A mobile unit that provides free black lung screenings to coal miners is up and running again this month after federal cuts led to the service’s pause earlier this year, according to a news release from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The mobile testing unit — run by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health — will be offering screenings in Morgantown next week and in Marion County on Aug. 5. An additional screening event will be held in nearby Maryland on Aug. 27.
Details for the visits are as follows:

8 a.m. – 4:30 p.m. from Tuesday, July 29 to Thursday, July 31 at the National Mine Rescue Association’s Post 5 Mine Rescue Contest at Mylan Park (500 Mylan Park Lane, Morgantown, WV 26501)
8 a.m. – 3:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 5 at the Price Cutter in Mannington (1 Rainbow Plaza, Mannington, WV 26582)
8 a.m. – 3:30 p.m. on Aug. 27 at the Grantsville (Maryland) Volunteer Fire Department (178 Springs Road, Grantsville, MD 21536)

While appointments are recommended, they’re not required.
All coal miners — current and former, and from any part of a mine — are encouraged to take advantage of the free health assessments, which include a black lung screening as well as tests to analyze general lung health. All reports and screenings are confidential.
Assessments will take about 30 minutes per a person and include a work history and respiratory questionnaire, a chest X-ray, a blood pressure screening and a spirometry breathing test.
Those who participate in the screenings should receive results in eight to 10 weeks, per the release. 
These screenings are crucial to helping with the early detection of black lung disease. Earlier detection of black lung allows miners to practice better mitigation, which can help slow the disease from progressing into more complicated and debilitating forms.
There is no cure for black lung. Experts say the best treatment is minimizing exposure to dangerous silica dust.
If miners receive a black lung diagnosis — either from the NIOSH mobile unit or another health care provider — they may qualify to apply for a Part 90 transfer through the federal Coal Mine and Safety Act of 1969. Part 90 transfers allow miners to relocate to a less dusty part of a mine without facing negative consequences like a cut in hours, pay or other retribution from mine operators.
NIOSH is the only entity qualified to certify X-ray results that are submitted as part of a Part 90 transfer request. 
Earlier this year, the federal government made NIOSH a target for cuts through the new Department of Government Efficiency. All employees within the agency’s Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program — which oversees the mobile unit as well as the certification of black lung X-rays — were put on administrative leave in April with permanent firings initially scheduled for June and July.
In late April, a class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of a West Virginia coal miner against the federal Department of Health and Human Services. Harry Wiley, the lead plaintiff on the suit, had been diagnosed with black lung in November 2024. Because of the federal cuts, Wiley was unable to receive a response to his Part 90 transfer request or have his X-ray results certified by NIOSH, leaving him further exposed to silica dust that is known to worsen his condition.
In May, attorneys successfully argued that the federal government’s cuts were in violation of congressionally mandated rights afforded to Wiley and other coal miners in similar situations. 
On May 13, U.S. District Judge Irene Berger issued a preliminary injunction in the class action case that ordered the “full restoration” of services at NIOSH’s Respiratory Health Division, which houses the CWHSP. 
The federal government issued a certification to the federal court on June 2 testifying that employees were back at NIOSH in both the RHD and the CWHSP. At that time, however, more work remained to get the mobile unit back on the road. This month’s screening dates are the first to occur since the federal cuts took place.

Article Summary

U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly, a Matteson Democrat, is running for Illinois’ open U.S. Senate seat, emphasizing accomplishments throughout her career.
It’s the third match-up between Kelly and a candidate backed by Gov. JB Pritzker.
Kelly has more than $2 million in her campaign fund, putting her second in the Democratic primary in fundraising.
Gun violence prevention has been one of her top priorities as a member of Congress and she said she believes Democrats are gaining more support on the issue.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

The Democratic primary for Illinois’ open U.S. Senate seat features three of the state’s most notable Democrats, but U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly isn’t worried big spending or endorsements for her opponents will drown out her voice.
“I’m used to tough races and really I’ve been motored by the people and that’s what it really comes down to,” Kelly told Capitol News Illinois. “I get out there, I grind, I meet everybody I can, and when I am in my position, again, I do the work.”
Kelly was the second Democrat to announce her intentions to replace retiring Sen. Dick Durbin in the 2026 election. She entered the race in early May about two weeks after Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton announced her candidacy that quickly came with endorsements from Gov. JB Pritzker and other Illinois Democrats.
U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi entered the race shortly after Kelly and brought with him more than $21 million in campaign funds to use as of the July fundraising report — nearly 10 times the $2.2 million Kelly has on hand.
Stratton had raised about $1 million but had about $666,000 on hand as of the end of June. Pritzker hasn’t put his full financial might behind Stratton yet, which could boost her fundraising totals and put Kelly up against more financial firepower. Kelly said she believes she can compete regardless of the financial landscape of the primary race.

“I would not have gotten into the race if I didn’t think I would have the resources to win,” Kelly said. “And I’m looking at what I’m doing and what I need to do – yeah they could spend more money, I know that’s a possibility, but again, my races have always been powered by the people.”
She cited recent examples of races around the country where the winning candidate didn’t raise or spend the most money. Kelly previously told voters at an event in Peoria earlier this month that she wants to get money out of campaigns but said in an interview that would have to be done through the legislative process.
Leaning on experience 
Kelly, of Matteson, said her experience at a variety of levels of government sets her apart from her opponents. She also argued her ability to pass legislation is something voters want.
As an elected official, Kelly has represented Illinois’ 2nd Congressional District since 2013 after winning a crowded special election to succeed former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., who resigned from Congress and later went to prison after pleading guilty to fraud charges. Jackson is now reported to be interested in running again for Kelly’s open seat.
Before serving in Congress, Kelly served two terms in the Illinois House before becoming chief of staff to then-Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias in the late 2000s. In 2010, she mounted an unsuccessful campaign to be Giannoulias’ successor, coming up short to Republican Dan Rutherford. After the failed 2010 campaign, Kelly became a top staffer for Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle until she was elected to Congress in the 2013 special election.
Kelly sought to elevate her stature in the Democratic Party of Illinois in 2021 after Mike Madigan resigned his role as party chair. Kelly won an internal party vote for the chairmanship over Chicago Ald. Michelle Harris, who was backed by Pritzker. But the following year, Pritzker-backed Rep. Lisa Hernandez, D-Cicero, successfully ousted Kelly.

“The people in the party, they know me, they know the work that I’ve done,” Kelly previously told Capitol News Illinois following an event in Peoria. “Despite what happened, I’ve still been an effective leader.”
Kelly pointed to her legislative experience, saying “I get things done.”
Gun violence prevention 
Preventing gun violence has been one of Kelly’s top priorities in Congress. She earned national headlines in 2016 when she led a sit-in in the U.S. House alongside late Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., and Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., to protest the lack of gun restrictions coming out of the Republican-controlled House. Kelly said one of her goals by staging the sit-in was to draw attention to individual lives lost to gun violence beyond headline-grabbing mass shootings.
Nine years after that protest, Kelly believes Democrats have moved the needle of public opinion on gun violence.
“People are hearing the message,” said Kelly, the vice chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. “Yes, gun violence might happen more in some places. But as you see, bullets don’t know zip codes.”
She pointed to the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, a 2022 law designed to quell gun violence through stronger background checks and more mental health services.
“I think people are paying attention,” Kelly said. “We just have to make sure it’s not normalized.”
Kelly does not believe her strong stance on guns would be a deterrent for voters in a statewide election, partly because she already represents one of the most geographically diverse congressional districts in the state. Her district stretches from Chicago’s Hyde Park neighborhood through a narrow stretch of the city along Lake Michigan before picking up the bulk of the district’s population in south suburban Cook and Will counties. From there, the district stretches deep into central Illinois to Danville and Pontiac.
Kelly said she wouldn’t own a gun herself but understands the various reasons why people have one.
“It’s about gun safety. It’s not about taking your gun away,” she said.
Countering Trump
The primary race between the three high-profile Democrats has remained cordial as they have focused their political attacks on Republicans rather than each other. Each has been jockeying to set themselves up as the most vocal critic of the Trump administration.

Democrats will have to work to undo much of Trump’s accomplishments to address voters’ economic concerns if the party takes control of Congress, Kelly said.  
“We will have to spend some time changing what’s already been put into law,” Kelly said.
While Trump sought to capitalize on economic concerns during last year’s election, Kelly said she believes he has lost high ground on the issue.
“He fooled the people since he said he was going to bring down prices on Day 1 while you see in the big, ugly bill that passed he kind of went the opposite way: taking away people’s health care; education is at stake, all those things,” she  said.

(Photo by Mitch Diamond/Getty Images)Utah’s Republican leaders are applauding plans to downsize the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s workforce in Washington, D.C. and send employees to five regional hubs, including one in Salt Lake City.
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox thanked Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins in a post on X Thursday for “choosing Utah as a new (USDA) hub.”
“This move brings the Department closer to the people it serves and strengthens its core mission to support farmers, ranchers, and rural families,” Cox said. “Utah is proud to partner in advancing American agriculture and rural prosperity.”
The department plans to reduce its workforce in the National Capital Region (which includes the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia) from about 4,600 employees to less than 2,000.
In addition to Salt Lake City, it also plans to add workers to regional offices in Raleigh, North Carolina; Kansas City, Missouri; Indianapolis; and Fort Collins, Colorado.The “reorganization,” which is expected to take years, according to a memorandum signed by Rollins, is meant to move the USDA geographically closer to its constituents of farmers, ranchers and foresters, Rollins said in a press release.

“American agriculture feeds, clothes, and fuels this nation and the world, and it is long past time the Department better serve the great and patriotic farmers, ranchers, and producers we are mandated to support,” Rollins said.
“President Trump was elected to make real change in Washington, and we are doing just that by moving our key services outside the beltway and into great American cities across the country,” Rollins added. “We will do so through a transparent and common-sense process that preserves USDA’s critical health and public safety services the American public relies on.”
In response, Democratic members of Congress in the National Capital Region issued a joint statement condemning the move as a “betrayal of American farmers, and an attack on the federal workforce that will severely damage services that the American people depend on.”
“We are disappointed but not surprised that the Trump administration is continuing its attacks on the federal workforce, this time through wasting taxpayer dollars to relocate key USDA facilities,” the joint statement said. “Let us be clear: these haphazard, unlawful relocations do not save taxpayer dollars or improve agency efficiency. We’ve seen this tactic before, and we know that it only results in brain drain, crushed morale, and cuts to vital programs American farmers depend on.”
Republicans, including Utah Sen. Mike Lee, applauded the move.
“The people making decisions about how our forests are managed and our food is grown shouldn’t be distant bureaucrats,” Lee said in a news release, congratulating the department for “decentralizing from Washington and relocating staff to Salt Lake City and other regional hubs.”

“Not only is this a big win for Utah’s farmers and ranchers, but also for our land managers as the department moves closer to the people who live, work, and rely upon these lands,” Lee added.
Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, also thanked Rollins, calling it a “bold move to shift USDA operations out of Washington, D.C., and into the communities they’re meant to serve.”
“This is smart government — more local, more accountable, and a better use of taxpayer dollars,” Schultz said. “Utah is proud to be one of just five new locations selected nationwide.
Schultz added the move will “strengthen our economy, support Utah families and ag producers, and ensure USDA resources are placed where they’re needed most — on the ground, serving our farmers and ranchers.”
“It’s a win for rural communities, for agriculture, and for restoring trust in how government serves the people,” he said.
U.S. Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minnesota — the top Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee — criticized the plan, saying it would diminish the department’s workforce. She also argued Rollins should have consulted with Congress before putting it in place.
Craig also pointed to a move under President Donald Trump’s first administration that shifted the USDA’s Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture out of Washington, D.C., which she said resulted in a “brain drain” in the agencies, as 75% of affected employees quit.
“To expect different results for the rest of USDA is foolish and naive,” Craig said. “Sadly, farmers will pay the price through a reduction in the quality and quantity of service they already receive from the department.”

(File photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman, a longtime member of the ultra-conservative U.S. House Freedom Caucus, is entering the 2026 South Carolina governor’s race.
The eight-year congressman is running to “finally clean up Columbia,” the campaign said in a statement. He plans to advocate for improvements to the state’s roads and schools, as well as term limits for state legislators. All would require the Legislature’s approval. Previous proposals to get legislators to vote term limits on themselves have gone nowhere.
A formal launch event is planned for Sunday in his hometown of Rock Hill.
Norman is by far the wealthiest member of South Carolina’s congressional delegation, according to annual disclosures. Before running for office, he grew his father’s construction business, the Warren Norman Company, into one of the state’s most successful commercial real estate firms.
He has been weighing a bid for the Governor’s Mansion for some time, hinting at a potential run to reporters in October 2023.
Norman, 72, spent about a decade total in the state House before voters elected him in 2017 to represent South Carolina’s 5th Congressional District. Anchored in his home county of York, just south of Charlotte, it stretches from a chunk of Spartanburg County along the state’s border with North Carolina southeast to Sumter County.
First elected to the state House in 2004, Norman gave up the Rock Hill seat in 2006 for an unsuccessful bid to defeat U.S. Rep. John Spratt, a longtime Democrat. Voters returned Norman to the state House in a 2009 special election.
Eight years later, he won a special election to replace former U.S. Rep. Mick Mulvaney, who left Congress when President Donald Trump tapped him to lead the Office of Management and Budget in his first term. After emerging from a seven-way GOP primary, Norman defeated Democrat Archie Parnell, a former Goldman Sachs executive and tax lawyer, with 51% of the vote.
Norman has not faced a primary challenger since that special election.
Two GOP candidates officially enter SC governor’s race

But he joins a crowded field for the 2026 governor’s race. Republicans who have already announced bids over the last month are Attorney General Alan Wilson, state Sen. Josh Kimbrell of Spartanburg County, and Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette.
Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina’s coast 1st District also is considering a bid.
Norman, who’s built a reputation as a fiscal haw, has spent his political career on the fringes, even within his own party. In spring 2022, he helped launch the South Carolina affiliate of the Freedom Caucus in the state House.
In Congress, he sits on the House Budget, Financial Services and Rules Committees. He gained that third committee appointment after working to first block, then supporting, Kevin McCarthy as speaker in 2023.
During his time in the Statehouse, Norman was one of just two House members to vote against a $120 million incentive package for Boeing’s North Charleston expansion in 2013, arguing there was no accountability for how the money would be spent.
Most recently, he joined Freedom Caucus leaders threatening to oppose the massive tax cut and spending bill to fund President Donald Trump’s priorities.

“We need to ensure good policy isn’t poisoned by bad spending,” Norman wrote on social media. “Congress should prioritize fiscal responsibility, transparency, and results. NOT rushed deals.”
Norman also made headlines in 2018, when he pulled out his loaded .38-caliber Smith & Wesson handgun during a meeting with constituents in what he said showed that guns are dangerous only in the hands of criminals. The demonstration brought criticism from even staunch Second Amendment enthusiasts. Despite calls for his resignation and prosecution, Attorney General Wilson declined to press charges.
And three days before former President Joe Biden’s inauguration in 2021, Norman was in the national news for texting former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows calling for martial law to keep Trump in office. “Our LAST HOPE is invoking Marshall Law!!” it read. He also voted against both House attempts to impeach the president during his first term.
But unlike other candidates that have sought to align themselves with Trump, Norman’s relationship with the president has been checkered. Norman’s campaign told The Associated Press he won’t seek the president’s endorsement.
An ally of former Gov. Nikki Haley, Norman was among the few elected officials to back her successful 2010 run for the Governor’s Mansion. He also was the lone member of Congress to endorse Haley over Trump in the 2024 Republican presidential primary, appearing frequently with her on the campaign trail.

Free.,Appeals court affirms nationwide block on birthright citizenship order,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/appeals-court-affirms-nationwide-block-birthright-citizenship-order,,"WASHINGTON —  A federal appeals court dealt a setback for President Donald Trump’s offensive to end birthright citizenship, even after the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the lower courts to avoid overly broad immigration rulings. The decision likely sets the stage for the high court to again hear arguments related to the constitutional right for babies born on U.S. soil.Judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit issued a 2-1 decision late Wednesday declaring Trump’s policy unconstitutional. The ruling upheld a lower court’s nationwide injunction against the controversial order.The original complaint was brought by Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon over the economic hardship states would bear if birthright citizenship was stripped from the Constitution.Writing the majority opinion, Judge Ronald M. Gould affirmed the district court rightly made its ruling nationwide, despite the recent Supreme Court decision.“The district court below concluded that a universal preliminary injunction is necessary to provide the States with complete relief,” Gould wrote. “We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in issuing a universal injunction in order to give the States complete relief.”An injunction covering only the states that challenged the order would be impractical because migrants covered by the order would inevitably move between states, Gould, who was appointed by Democratic former President Bill Clinton, continued, explaining that states would then need to overhaul verification for numerous social safety net programs.“For that reason, the States would suffer the same irreparable harms under a geographically-limited injunction as they would without an injunction,” he wrote.Judge Michael D. Hawkins, also a Clinton appointee, joined the majority opinion.In a dissent, Judge Patrick J. Bumatay, appointed to the bench by Trump in 2019, wrote that courts must be “vigilant in enforcing the limits of our jurisdiction and our power to order relief. Otherwise, we risk entangling ourselves in contentious issues not properly before us and overstepping our bounds.”The U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond for comment.Supreme Court rulingThe decision comes less than two weeks after a district judge in New Hampshire issued a preliminary injunction blocking Trump’s policy to end birthright citizenship and granted a class certification to infants who would be affected by the order.The suit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of immigrants whose babies would be affected by the order shortly after the Supreme Court narrowed lower courts’ abilities to impose nationwide orders.The Supreme Court’s conservative majority issued the 6-3 decision on June 27 after the justices reviewed three cases consolidated into one that brought together plaintiffs from Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin. The District of Columbia and the county and city of San Francisco also joined.The justices ruled that Trump’s directive to end birthright citizenship can go into effect within 30 days of their ruling in all non-plaintiff states.",,,,2025-07-25 15:57:01.343359

The Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act would lift the federal limit on the number of Medicare-funded residency slots, raising the total number by 14,000 over seven years. Arkansas would be among the states the bill prioritizes because of its rural areas, new medical schools such as the Alice L. Walton School of Medicine and hospitals that serve areas designated by the U.S. Health Resources & Services Administration as health professional shortage areas, according to a Thursday news release from Republican U.S. Sen. John Boozman.
The number of residency slots in Arkansas increased from 210 to 356 between 2017 and 2023, but the number of Arkansas medical school graduates outpaced the number of in-state residency slots from 2021 to 2023, according to the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement (ACHI).

Most doctors continue to practice medicine in the state in which they completed their residencies, according to the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC). As of 2021, there are 5.7 active full-time primary care physicians per 10,000 Arkansans, a decrease from 6.0 in 2020, according to ACHI.
“There is an urgent, demonstrated need to strengthen our health care system by combating the alarming shortage of providers, particularly in rural areas,” Boozman, an optometrist from Rogers, said in the news release. “Lifting the outdated cap on residency positions supported by Medicare can expand the supply of physicians while helping ensure access to quality care and treatment in more communities nationwide.”
The AAMC, the National Rural Health Association and the American Medical Association all support the Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act, according to the news release.
“With the nation facing a persistent physician shortage, this bipartisan bill would enhance and build on the investments academic health systems are making to strengthen the physician workforce by increasing Medicare support for physician training,” AAMC President and CEO David Skorton said in the news release.
The bill’s lead sponsors in addition to Boozman are Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat; Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Georgia Democrat; and Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican.
Boozman is also sponsoring the Physicians for Underserved Areas Act, which would change the residency distribution process to give areas where a hospital has recently closed a greater chance of receiving new residents, and the Resident Education Deferred Interest Act, which would allow medical and dental school graduates to pause student loan payments and interest accrual during their residencies. He has introduced both bills in previous sessions of Congress.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont health insurers reduce requests for 2026 premium increases .","After three years of double-digit insurance premium hikes, Vermont’s two health insurers have lowered the percentage increases they are seeking for plans sold on the state insurance marketplace in 2026, citing a new state law on prescription drugs as one big factor.
The state’s health care regulator, the Green Mountain Care Board, reviews the pricing for plans qualified to be sold the following year on Vermont Health Connect, the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace. The board held hearings on the 2026 rate proposals this week for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont and MVP, the only two insurers that sell health insurance plans there. 
Vermonters without access to an affordable health plan through an employer can purchase plans on the individual market for themselves and their families. Businesses with 100 employers or less can buy small group plans. These plans provide health coverage for fewer than 70,000 Vermonters, according to insurer filings with the Green Mountain Care Board. But the trends that lead to price increases for those health insurance plans affect other commercially available plans as well.

Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont lowered its initial request from an average premium rate increase of 23.5% for individual plans down to 15.1%. It amended the requested average premium rate increase for small group plans from 13.5% down to 7.4%.
Facing financial headwinds, Blue Cross has been on the brink of insolvency after a yearslong surge in the cost of insurance claims, ending 2024 with a record deficit of $62 million. 
Double-digit premium rate hikes every year are not sustainable for Vermonters, said Charles Becker, a staff attorney at the Office of the Health Care Advocate, which represents consumers at the rate hearings. That’s especially true when the hikes are “not even enough to keep Vermont’s sole home state insurer solvent given the extraordinarily high cost of care.”
MVP, which sells the large majority of its plans in New York state where the company is based and only 8% of its plans in Vermont, asked for a lower increase in May and revised the request even lower. The company is now requesting an average premium increase of 2.98% for small group plans, down from 7.5%, and of 2.84% for individual plans, down from 6.24%.
MVP’s financial problems have not fully resolved, but the company trimmed administrative costs and is projected to be in the black for 2025 after years of losses for individual plans in Vermont, while still seeing losses from their small group plans, said the carrier’s top actuary Eric Bachner at the rate review hearing.
The reduction in rates for MVP has a “clear and positive impact,” Vermont’s Chief Health Care Advocate Mike Fisher said during the MVP rate hearing. However, the widening divide between the cost of the plans from the marketplace’s two insurers is concerning. 
“A large and growing price variation between the two carriers has a substantial and real negative impact on many Vermonters,” Fisher said at the MVP hearing. 
That’s because federal tax credits that subsidize the purchase of individual health insurance plans on the marketplace, to an amount depending on household income, are set based on lower cost plans, Fisher explained in an interview. If the benchmark for the credits is based on the roughly 3% increase of MVP plans, people on Blue Cross’ plans will likely face higher premium costs due to the disparity in rate increases. 
Meanwhile, expanded tax credits for medium-income households put in place during the Covid-19 pandemic, called Enhanced Premium Tax Credit, are set to expire at the end of 2025 if Congress does not extend them. 
The enhanced subsidy “provided for a really substantial improvement of premium affordability for Vermonters,” Fisher said. He said he is worried about the return of a sharp end to all subsidies above 400% of the federal poverty line — roughly an income of $62,000 for a one-person household — once enhanced tax credits disappear. That may lead some Vermonters just over that line to forgo insurance altogether, he said.
Alongside the phase-out of the Enhanced Premium Tax Credit, Vermont officials project 45,000 Vermonters will lose access to health insurance — both Medicaid and marketplace plans — under new regulatory requirements included in President Donald Trump’s recently signed “One Big Beautiful” tax bill. 
During a public comment period, Grace Powers, 27, said she opted into a Blue Cross insurance plan because the enhanced federal tax credits made it affordable. As a result, Powers said she was able to get surgery necessary to improve her quality of life. 
With the expected sunsetting of the federal enhanced subsidies and the requested rate increases for both Blue Cross and MVP, Powers said she will no longer be able to afford any health insurance plan in Vermont. Her only access to health care will be the emergency room if her “health deteriorates enough to be treated there.” 
“Without insurance, I won’t be able to access primary and preventive care,” Powers said. “I’m urging you to reject these increases because it will make accessing any health care unaffordable for myself, my loved ones and my community.”

‘Bankable savings’
The curtailment of Vermont insurers’ proposed premium rate increases follow a handful of health care bills Gov. Phil Scott signed into law in June. 
Act 55 curbs the amount Vermont’s larger hospitals can charge for outpatient prescription drugs, particularly injection or IV-administered drugs for the treatment of cancers or autoimmune diseases. Act 68 sets forth a long-term plan to transform the health care system, including the implementation of reference-base pricing for health care providers. Act 49 designates emergency authority to the Green Mountain Care Board to set hospital prices in case of insurer insolvency.
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont is able to trim its premium increase request because the Act 55 cap on some prescription drugs will result in a “measurable, bankable set of savings” in 2026, Michael Donofrio, a lawyer for the insurer, said during the hearing. 
Another Blue Cross attorney, Bridget Asay, warned that if the Green Mountain Care Board rejects the rates the company is requesting, it “will not reduce the cost of health care.”
“What it will do is threaten the company’s solvency and ability to serve Vermonters,” she said.
Part of why Blue Cross needs a larger increase than MVP is the insurer’s need to replenish the reserves it uses to pay claims, said the insurer’s Chief Financial Officer Ruth Greene. The company expects to place 7% of premium earnings back into those reserves, she said, calling it a “critical component” of the insurer’s financial recovery plan. 
MVP estimated that just 2% of its premiums would need to be allocated to reserves in 2026 to maintain them.
But for Blue Cross, savings are “dangerously low,” Greene said, noting the insurer took out a $30 million loan at the end of last year from its parent affiliate Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan.
Becker, the consumers’ attorney, said that a large percentage contribution to insurer reserves was “once unthinkable.”
Vermonters should not be “forced to hand over 7% in premiums each year for who knows how many more years in order to rebuild Blue Cross’ depleted reserves and to pay back Michigan,” he said.  
Vermonters ‘need serious relief’
A Vermonter named Melissa from Westfield said in a written comment that her family is insured through a small business plan, and pays over $1,500 a month with a $14,000 deductible. 
When asked by Becker how Melissa’s situation made him feel, Andrew Garland, a Blue Cross vice president, said it was “very upsetting.”
“That’s not what we want for our customers. The cost of care is too high,” Garland said. “We have to find a way to break that cycle and bring it down. It is not affordable.”
In the Blue Cross hearing, Green Mountain Care Board Chair Owen Foster said the state’s health care leaders came together in May for emergency talks about how to address health care affordability concerns, but produced “$0.00 of savings.”
“We have to be accountable to results right now, not just effort,” Foster said. “It’s just not okay to say to Vermonters, ‘We couldn’t come up with anything amongst all these health care leaders. Nothing we could do,’ is not an acceptable answer to Vermont right now.”
The Green Mountain Care Board asked for additional data and analysis from the two insurers as members evaluate the proposed insurance rate increases in the coming weeks. 
The requested hikes for small group and individual plans come after the Green Mountain Care Board approved double digit increases to the baseline for insurance premiums for large employers last month.
Former Blue Cross lobbyist Sara Teachout was appointed to the Green Mountain Care Board by Gov. Scott earlier in July, and is set to start her role July 28. Teachout will not be participating in the 2026 Qualified Health Plan rate review as the companies’ filing were submitted in May and the process started internally in the fall of last year, according to the Board’s Communication and Information Officer Kristen LaJeunesse.
At the close of the Blue Cross hearing, Foster said the board will seek to balance the risks the insurer will face without the proposed premium increases with the interests of Vermonters who “need serious relief.”

Sherman Smith/Kansas ReflectorTOPEKA — A Georgia man who admitted to illegally killing deer in Kansas and featuring the kills on his YouTube hunting show will pay $25,000 in fines and restitution, and is forever banned from hunting in Kansas.
Matt Jennings, 35, reached a plea agreement this week on two charges of violating the federal Lacey Act, which prohibits interstate commerce for wildlife taken in violation of state regulations. He is the host of “The Game,” which streams on YouTube and CarbonTV.
​“HUNTING is all I’ve ever known, to kill to eat… it’s what makes my heart pound and my soul fulfilled,” Jennings says on the show’s website.
According to court documents, Jennings primarily lives in Bowdon, Georgia, and sometimes resides in Woodland, Alabama. He traveled to Kansas in November 2022 with a tag that allowed him to take an antlered deer within a hunting area near WaKeeney in northwest Kansas.
On Nov. 11, 2022, Jennings killed an antlered deer near Florence in the central part of the state, which wasn’t covered by his tag. He drove to Oklahoma the following day to register the kill there, then returned to Kansas.
A week later, he killed another deer near WaKeeney. Although it was in the area allowed under his tag, the second kill violated state law by exceeding the bag limit of one antlered deer per season.
A joint investigation between the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service confirmed Jennings’ movements through phone data and social media posts.
Jennings featured the kills on “The Game,” which the show’s website describes as “a dark, in your face, more serious look at what makes a hunter tick.”
“It’s about pushing one’s self to the breaking point, and then looking back on the experience to learn from it,” the website says. “Matt Jennings takes you to the frontlines weekly to destinations in your backyard or worlds away. Either way, the intensity and drive this man has for the hunt will draw you to him and to what crazy things he will do next.”
Episodes feature him as a skilled bow hunter dressed in camouflage, with black grease around his eyes and cheeks. More than 62,000 users subscribe to the show’s YouTube channel. The most recent episode is from 11 months ago.
Recent comments on the videos berate Jennings.
“Hey Kansan here, stay in Georgia with that Poaching s***,” someone with the username “@Jimmy2toes4u” wrote in a comment on one of the shows. “Bad enough to see all the out of town plates much less guys who think their … ‘hunting show’ gives em the right to do whatever they want.”
The most recent post to the show’s YouTube account, from July 11, is a short promotional clip titled: “One day your life will flash before your eyes. Make sure it’s worth watching.”
Someone with the username “@lifesshort69” commented: “One day your show will flash before your eyes. Make sure your not a poacher and its worth watching.”
Under federal charges, Jennings faced up to a year in prison and as much as a $100,000 fine. Under the plea deal, he will serve five years of unsupervised probation and pay a $10,000 fine. He also will pay $15,000 in restitution to the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks Law Enforcement Fund in Pratt. He has to surrender the two illegally taken deer mounts, and he must retake an Alabama Hunter Education Course.
Jennings is prohibited while on probation from hunting, trapping, fishing or being with anyone engaged in those activities in Nebraska, Missouri, Oklahoma, Colorado, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois and Minnesota. He agreed to a lifetime hunting and fishing ban in Kansas.
In exchange for the plea, the federal government dismissed a charge from the original complaint and agreed not to file additional charges — unless Jennings denies his illegal activity or engages in additional criminal conduct.
Jennings didn’t immediately respond to Kansas Reflector requests for comment by phone and email.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-25 19:18:14+00:00,CT Mirror,Connecticut forced to ‘ration’ EV rebates ahead of expiring federal tax credits,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/25/ct-electric-vehicle-rebates/,"Consumer rebates for purchases of new EVs and plug-in hybrids will decrease from $1,500 to $500 starting Aug. 1.","A recent spike in demand for electric vehicles ahead of soon-to-expire federal tax credits has led Connecticut to lower some of its own incentives for car buyers, officials said this week.
The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection announced on Thursday that it would lower its standard rebate for purchasers of new EVs and plug-in hybrids from $1,500 to $500, due in part to what officials said was a more than 30% increase in demand for the rebates before federal tax credits expire on Sep. 30.
During a virtual meeting with reporters and public stakeholders Thursday, DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said the sudden spike in demand had forced the agency to begin “rationing” its incentives to ensure the ongoing fiscal health of the Connecticut Hydrogen and Electric Vehicle Purchase Rebate program.
“The budget that we have for the CHEAPR program is finite,” Dykes said. “We’re trying to be good stewards of that money.”
The new, lower standard rebates will take effect Aug. 1. The state’s “Rebate+” incentives, which are available to certain prequalified low- and moderate-income buyers, will remain the same for the time being, DEEP said.
Federal tax credits are expiring as a result of Republicans’ tax and spending plan, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed on July 4. The law ended tax credits of up to $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used vehicles.
While DEEP did not immediately provide data on the number of state rebates that have been requested or approved since the federal law took effect, automakers have been publicly pushing customers to take advantage of the tax credits before they go away.
Tesla — which cannot sell its cars directly to buyers in Connecticut — recently published a banner advertisement on its website about the expiring tax credits, urging customers to “Take Inventory Now.”
The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. 
Barry Kresch, the president of the EV Club of Connecticut, said that while he understood DEEP’s rationale for lowering its incentives, the move comes at a precarious time for the industry. Nationally, EV sales are expected to hit a slump later this year after the expiration of the tax breaks, he said. 
“I’m sad to see the reduction of the incentive, because I think it was effective,” Kresch said. “Hopefully it can come back, depending on how the market looks.” 
The number of EVs in Connecticut has quadrupled since 2020, but still only account for about 2.7 % of registered vehicles in the state. Despite the limits on direct sales, Tesla cars are by far the state’s most popular brand of EVs, followed by Toyota, Jeep and Chevrolet. 
Oliver Johnson, a sales manager at Toyota of Stamford, said his dealership has experienced a slight increase in interest in the automaker’s EV lineup — led by the plug-in hybrid RAV 4 — since the new law went into effect. The dealership typically sells under a dozen EVs a month, he said, meaning the bump resulted in about three to four additional sales. 
Johnson said that customers in the market for EVs are well aware of the deadline. “Everyone knows about it,” he said.
Since launching in 2015, the CHEAPR program has issued more than 21,000 rebates worth over $42 million, according to DEEP. The program is funded through a fee assessed on new vehicle sales and registrations.
This year’s standard rebate was already reduced in January from last year’s maximum of $2,250, due to strong demand. It had previously been set to drop again in August, to $1,000, prior to DEEP’s announcement of further cuts on Thursday. (Rebate+ incentives for new vehicles previously been expected to increase as part of the August changes, before being held flat).
In its announcement on Thursday, DEEP said officials would work with the CHEAPR Board to discuss potentially increasing incentives again to meet demand following the expiration of the federal tax credits in September.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tesla-charging-station-1024x761.jpg,,,2025-07-25 15:57:01.343359

Members of both parties in Congress objected to the move.The Education Department released $1.3 billion for before- and after-school programs as well as summer programs in mid-July, but the rest of the funding remained stalled.Madi Biedermann, a Department of Education spokesperson, wrote in an email to States Newsroom that the White House budget office “has completed its review” of the remaining accounts and “has directed the Department to release all formula funds.”The administration will begin sending that money to school districts next week, Biedermann wrote.Appropriators cheerMaine Republican Sen. Susan Collins, chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, wrote in a statement the “funds are essential to the operation of Maine’s public schools, supporting everything from classroom instruction to adult education.”“I am pleased that following outreach from my colleagues and me, the Administration has agreed to release these highly-anticipated resources,” Collins wrote. “I will continue working to ensure that education funds are delivered without delay so that schools have adequate time to plan their finances for the upcoming school year, allowing students to arrive back to class this fall to properly-funded schools.”Collins and nine other Republican senators wrote a letter to Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought earlier this month asking him to “faithfully implement” the spending law Congress approved in March.“The decision to withhold this funding is contrary to President (Donald) Trump's goal of returning K-12 education to the states,” the GOP senators wrote. “This funding goes directly to states and local school districts, where local leaders decide how this funding is spent, because as we know, local communities know how to best serve students and families.“Withholding this funding denies states and communities the opportunity to pursue localized initiatives to support students and their families.”West Virginia Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, chairwoman of the appropriations subcommittee that funds the Education Department, wrote in a statement released Friday she was glad to see the funding unfrozen.“The programs are ones that enjoy longstanding, bipartisan support like after-school and summer programs that provide learning and enrichment opportunities for school aged children, which also enables their parents to work and contribute to local economies, and programs to support adult learners working to gain employment skills, earn workforce certifications, or transition into postsecondary education,” Capito wrote. “That’s why it’s important we continue to protect and support these programs.”",,,,2025-07-25 15:57:01.343359

(Photo by Mitch Diamond/Getty Images)Utah’s Republican leaders are applauding plans to downsize the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s workforce in Washington, D.C. and send employees to five regional hubs, including one in Salt Lake City. 
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox thanked Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins in a post on X Thursday for “choosing Utah as a new (USDA) hub.”
“This move brings the Department closer to the people it serves and strengthens its core mission to support farmers, ranchers, and rural families,” Cox said. “Utah is proud to partner in advancing American agriculture and rural prosperity.”
The department plans to reduce its workforce in the National Capital Region (which includes the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia) from about 4,600 employees to less than 2,000. 
In addition to Salt Lake City, it also plans to add workers to regional offices in Raleigh, North Carolina; Kansas City, Missouri; Indianapolis; and Fort Collins, Colorado.The “reorganization,” which is expected to take years, according to a memorandum signed by Rollins, is meant to move the USDA geographically closer to its constituents of farmers, ranchers and foresters, Rollins said in a press release.

“American agriculture feeds, clothes, and fuels this nation and the world, and it is long past time the Department better serve the great and patriotic farmers, ranchers, and producers we are mandated to support,” Rollins said. 
“President Trump was elected to make real change in Washington, and we are doing just that by moving our key services outside the beltway and into great American cities across the country,” Rollins added. “We will do so through a transparent and common-sense process that preserves USDA’s critical health and public safety services the American public relies on.”
In response, Democratic members of Congress in the National Capital Region issued a joint statement condemning the move as a “betrayal of American farmers, and an attack on the federal workforce that will severely damage services that the American people depend on.” 
“We are disappointed but not surprised that the Trump administration is continuing its attacks on the federal workforce, this time through wasting taxpayer dollars to relocate key USDA facilities,” the joint statement said. “Let us be clear: these haphazard, unlawful relocations do not save taxpayer dollars or improve agency efficiency. We’ve seen this tactic before, and we know that it only results in brain drain, crushed morale, and cuts to vital programs American farmers depend on.”
Republicans, including Utah Sen. Mike Lee, applauded the move.
“The people making decisions about how our forests are managed and our food is grown shouldn’t be distant bureaucrats,” Lee said in a news release, congratulating the department for “decentralizing from Washington and relocating staff to Salt Lake City and other regional hubs.”

“Not only is this a big win for Utah’s farmers and ranchers, but also for our land managers as the department moves closer to the people who live, work, and rely upon these lands,” Lee added.
Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, also thanked Rollins, calling it a “bold move to shift USDA operations out of Washington, D.C., and into the communities they’re meant to serve.” 
“This is smart government — more local, more accountable, and a better use of taxpayer dollars,” Schultz said. “Utah is proud to be one of just five new locations selected nationwide. 
Schultz added the move will “strengthen our economy, support Utah families and ag producers, and ensure USDA resources are placed where they’re needed most — on the ground, serving our farmers and ranchers.”
“It’s a win for rural communities, for agriculture, and for restoring trust in how government serves the people,” he said. 
U.S. Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minnesota — the top Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee — criticized the plan, saying it would diminish the department’s workforce. She also argued Rollins should have consulted with Congress before putting it in place. 
Craig also pointed to a move under President Donald Trump’s first administration that shifted the USDA’s Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture out of Washington, D.C., which she said resulted in a “brain drain” in the agencies, as 75% of affected employees quit. 
“To expect different results for the rest of USDA is foolish and naive,” Craig said. “Sadly, farmers will pay the price through a reduction in the quality and quantity of service they already receive from the department.”

(Mia Maldonado/Idaho Capital Sun)A federal judge on Thursday extended a temporary legal block that prevents Idaho from verifying the immigration status of people receiving HIV treatment.
U.S. District Judge Amanda Brailsford issued a preliminary injunction, blocking Idaho from enforcing a new state law meant to prevent unauthorized immigrants from accessing public funded assistance. But the block only prevents enforcement for the HIV treatment program called the Ryan White Program. 
The injunction will prevent immigration status checks while the court considers a lawsuit brought by ACLU of Idaho and other legal groups on behalf of an Idaho doctor and immigrant patients. 
The lawsuit argues Idaho’s law would deny immigrants life-saving health care that prevents HIV transmission.
“This ruling saves lives,” Dr. Abby Davids, a doctor suing state officials, said in a statement.

 Ruling only protects HIV program. Other challenges to Idaho’s new law being explored, ACLU attorney previously said

Soon after Idaho’s new law, House Bill 135, took effect July 1, the judge temporarily blocked Idaho officials from applying it to the HIV treatment program in response to a lawsuit by ACLU of Idaho and other legal groups. The judge also provisionally certified class-action status in the lawsuit, extending the protections to any immigrant patients who are or could benefit from the program in the future.
The law cuts the few publicly funded services that unauthorized immigrants can receive in the state. Idaho’s law applies to a range of public benefits, beyond the HIV treatment program. ACLU is considering legal challenges for other programs affected by the law, an ACLU of Idaho attorney previously told the Idaho Capital Sun.
“We are pleased that the Court blocked Idaho officials’ attempts to sidestep federal law and ignore legal precedent,” ACLU of Idaho Staff Attorney Emily Croston said in a statement. “We will continue to fight these unconstitutional attacks on our immigrant neighbors. Immigrant communities form the backbone of Idaho, and they deserve better.”
The Idaho Attorney General’s Office could not be immediately reached for comment.
 Judge finds plaintiffs ‘likely to succeed on the merits’ of federal preemption claim

Attorneys for the ACLU and other legal groups who sued over the law argued Idaho’s new law is preempted by federal law that exempts certain public benefits from immigration status verification. 
In the preliminary injunction order, the judge wrote that the groups “are likely to succeed on the merits of their” preemption claim.
In a court hearing earlier this month, an attorney for the Idaho Attorney General’s Office representing Idaho officials in the lawsuit argued that the suing patients and doctor lacked a right to enforce federal law — and argued that extra eligibility requirements can be added to public benefits.

(Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images for SEIU)Colorado State Treasurer Dave Young’s sister Dorothy has relied heavily on Medicaid “for health care and for life-sustaining support” as she lives with severe cognitive and physical disabilities.
“It really has been a true lifeline for the entire family,” Young said in a press call Thursday. “We have tried to provide care for my sister, and her needs are so demanding, so extreme, that a family by itself can’t manage to make this work. We need help, we need support, we’ve thrown ourselves into this to the extent that we can, but many, many other families are in similar situations.”
Young said that when Medicaid cuts hit Colorado in the past, the state could no longer provide residential care for his sister. She went through 20 different residential facilities in a span of 18 months, all of which were “inadequate” because they did not have proper funding, he said.
“Often, she was ejected from a placement because she overwhelmed the providers, sometimes without even a phone call,” Young said.
Young and financial officials from four other Democratic-led states — including Minnesota State Auditor Julie Blaha — participated in a call hosted by Americans for Responsible Growth, a national advocacy group that works with state financial leaders. They warned about how Republicans’ recent policy law, called by President Donald Trump the “big, beautiful bill,” will negatively affect Medicaid and Medicare recipients ahead of the 60th anniversary of the programs.
The law cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, a state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes.
Dave Wallack, executive director of Americans for Responsible Growth, said that since the Trump administration took office, Republicans have “systematically gutted health care programs, fired thousands of federal workers, and slashed more than a trillion dollars for Medicaid, the largest cut in the program’s history.”
Wallack said the cuts will lead to 17 million Americans losing health care coverage and more than 50,000 preventable deaths annually. Young said in Colorado, more than 375,000 recipients could lose Medicaid coverage. Democratic officials from New Mexico, Illinois, Minnesota and Maryland all said that rural communities in their states will be hit hardest by the cuts, and they will feel the effects first.
Rural hospitals at risk
Laura Montoya, the New Mexico state treasurer, said her state is the No. 1 recipient state for Medicaid in the nation, and 80% of the babies born in New Mexico are born into Medicaid. She said the federal law’s changes to Medicaid will “force hospitals and clinics to either raise premiums or copays or shut down entirely,” and 15 hospitals in rural communities are already at risk of closing their doors.
“Our state’s entire provider network depends on the state’s current Medicaid coverage landscape,” Montoya said. “These cuts will increase health care costs for all New Mexicans regardless of Medicaid enrollment, not to mention more uninsured individuals could end up skipping preventative care leading to worsened health outcomes, higher cost for emergency care, and more crowded emergency rooms and urgent care facilities, placing even more strain on an already overwhelmed system.”
The shift of responsibility for states to fund Medicaid could also destabilize New Mexico’s entire support network, including housing assistance, early childhood education, public safety and economic development, Montoya said. The New Mexico Legislature passed a measure creating a Medicaid trust fund to safeguard services amid federal cuts, she added.
Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs said 44% of the Medicaid recipients in his state are children, 9% are seniors, and 7% are adults with disabilities. Nine rural hospitals in Illinois, all in Republican districts, are at risk of closing because of funding cuts, he said.
“When hospitals close and health care providers cut back, people lose their jobs. They lose their income, and their health insurance,” Frerichs said. “Illinois’ economy will be destabilized. The cruel, inhumane Trump big bad budget bill will wreak havoc across Illinois for years to come.”
Minnesota’s Blaha said about 25% of Minnesotans are enrolled in the state’s Medicaid program, which also supports 30% of births. For Black and Indigenous communities, those numbers are even higher: The state’s medical assistance program covers 80% of Black babies born in the state and 90% of Indigenous babies.
Blaha said it is more cost-efficient to keep people on these health care programs in a stable place, as it’s more expensive “to pull somebody up who’s fallen through.”
“It is time to stand up and tell Congress and tell Trump to roll back these terrible cuts and try to stop the avalanche before it crushes us all,” Blaha said.
Brooke Lierman, the Maryland state comptroller, said 42% of her state’s population is supported by Medicaid or Medicare. She said the two programs were designed to take care of “vulnerable Americans” who would be “sicker and worse off” without the coverage they provide.
“These programs are economic powerhouses that drive prosperity in our communities and strengthen our state’s fiscal foundation,” Lierman said. “Cutting Medicaid is both fiscally reckless and morally bankrupt, abandoning our most vulnerable residents, including our seniors and people with disabilities, while destroying the economic foundation that so many of our communities depend on.”
‘Among the greatest policy achievements’ 
Health care is a “major economic driver” in Colorado, Young said, as hospitals employ about 1 in 5 Colorado residents and generate $1 billion in tax revenue yearly. Reduced federal investment in health care will lead to clinic closures and reduced tax revenue that will affect quality of life for “Coloradans of every age and income bracket,” he said.
“Colorado cannot afford to downsize our health care sector,” Young said. “We’re already facing dire workforce and health care shortages, especially in rural and frontier communities. The state can’t make up for these losses either.”
Medicaid and Medicare are “among the greatest policy achievements in American history,” Young said, as the programs strengthen health care systems and lift people out of poverty. He said the programs can be strengthened while saving money, but “this slash and burn technique” will be “devastating.”
“When people get the care they need, they hold down jobs, they provide for their families and avoid catastrophic medical debt,” Young said.L

(Source: UNC-Asheville) Even as North Carolina’s institutions of higher learning face financial headwinds, the UNC Board of Governors gave the greenlight on Thursday for UNC-Asheville to move to forward with an ambitious, multi-purpose soccer stadium occupying 54 acres of green space.
Thursday’s vote is seen as an initial step allowing UNC-A to enter into a ground lease with the University’s Endowment Fund negotiating with the developer for the mixed-use stadium involving its millennial campus property.
UNC Board of Governors committee chair Kirk Bradley said the board will take whatever time is necessary to ensure critical questions are answered before final approval is given.

“This is a challenging time for higher education and will continue to be so in the 21st century,” said Bradley. “I’m glad we have leaders on our campuses like Chancellor van Noort, who are paying attention to the windshield as to what’s coming and what needs to be done versus focused primarily on the rear-view mirror of how things have always been done.”
Working to woo a professional team
Dr. Kimberly van Noort explained that the Asheville City Soccer Club currently plays at a facility on the school’s campus. The city club is currently U.S.L. Division II, which is the highest amateur level. The team is planning to bring Division I professional soccer to Asheville.
“In order to bring that professional team here, they are required to have a 5,000-seat stadium. And we were approached by the Asheville City Soccer Club about some of our millennial campus projects, and we agreed to allow them to enter into a conversation with us to take a look at the different parcels that we own, because we felt that this would be a very mutually beneficial project,” van Noort told the board.
The UNC-Asheville Endowment Fund would execute a 99-year ground lease with the developer. The project would go well beyond being a professional soccer venue. The stadium will eventually host concerts and festivals and other entertainment events throughout the year.
“It will be the only outdoor facility of this size in western North Carolina, and we anticipate great demand, including from local youth sports organizations and quite probably high school sports as well as this will be a very versatile stadium able to host football as well as soccer,” the chancellor offered.
  Dr. Kimberly van Noort (UNC-BOG videostream/PBSNC)
The project as envisioned would be built in two phases. The first being the stadium, followed by student community housing and retail space. The preliminary budget is estimated at $201.4 million, according to documents shared by UNC-Asheville.
The timeline would see the stadium completed by the end of 2028 with the housing and retail phase opening by the spring of the following year.
Community opposition
Van Noort’s enthusiasm for the project was somewhat tempered by members of the Board of Governors who have heard from nearby homeowners who are angry about the loss of woodlands near their homes.
“This would destroy our neighborhood and our way of life, full stop, no question,” Chris Cotteta, president of the Five Points Neighborhood Association, told the Asheville Watchdog in a June interview. Cotteta believes the project will have a negative impact on residential property values, forcing some to move.
Others have noted the loss of green space would adversely impact biology and environmental science classes that routinely use the wooded property.
Jennifer Haygood, the Senior Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer for the University of North Carolina System, said “guardrails and some basic expectation” would be put in place to ensure the developer bears the risk, should the project continue to move forward.
Board member Gene Davis, a real estate attorney, cautioned his colleagues that long-term leases can be tricky.

“I also want to encourage them to negotiate such that the property, the underlying property that’s being leased by UNC Asheville for this development, is never collateral for any loans. The collateral should be in my view the leases and the improvements but never the land. In short, the land should never be put at risk,” advised Davis.
Even as Bradley sought to move the conversation along, Davis said that it would be critically important that the development partners share UNC Asheville’s commitment to environmental stewardship.
“As chair of buildings and grounds at NC Museum of Art, I participated and led a development that was both beautiful and environmentally responsible in our art park. UNC Asheville should require the same from this development and from this developer, something that is both environmentally responsible and beautiful.”
Board member Sonja Phillips Nichols said she’d like to see the Board of Governors keep tighter control of the project, rather than turn over the lease to the university’s Endowment Fund.

“There’s a part of me that just feels like, ‘okay, so I’m getting ready to give something to someone and then they get to make all the decisions and now it’s out of our hands,'” Nichols said.
Bradley reassured Nichols that the proposal was no different than large scale projects explored by other UNC institutions.
“I am bothered by the amount of emotion that the community is sharing,” Nichols continued. “So, I appreciate that you are meeting with them and that you’re going on what I think needs to be a big deal PR tour and making them feel comfortable about this. I’m feeling the community.”
Bradley acknowledged the stadium project had drawn a fair amount of criticism, based on the unknown.
“I’ve always found that volume and vitriol does not go that far in trying to prove your point. And there are certainly some people that have exceeded that and made some personal attacks that I think are despicable.”
Bradley said the Board of Governors along with UNC-Asheville will study the facts and listen to subject matter expertise and move forward.
A lone voice of opposition
The harshest criticism for stadium project came from Swadesh Chatterjee.

Chatterjee who has served on the board the last two years, said he could not understand the rush to move forward with a project, even before the chancellor had the chance to meet with local residents.
“Why can’t we first let the chancellor meet with the community, feel the pulse and calm them down? If we go to the community after we agreed to give it to endowment fund, they think that this [decision] has already been made.”
Chatterjee noted that if student housing was needed, which is phase two of the stadium project, the UNC System could address that need.
UNC-Asheville’s student headcount for the Spring 2025 semester was 2,801, a modest increase from the previous year as the university continues to recover from Hurricane Helene.
Chatterjee said retention should be the university’s focus now. In the five years prior, UNC-Asheville saw a 25% decline in its student body, forcing it to cut more than a dozen programs and majors.
“How is it going to help students and academics?” Chatterjee asked. “I have not seen anywhere by building a soccer stadium that we attract and more students. I am not convinced.”

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Funding for more police officers, parking requirements for new housing and penalties for littering.
These are just a few of the issues covered by 333 new Washington state laws set to take effect Sunday. July 27 marks 90 days since the end of the 2025 legislative session in Olympia, when most bills signed by Gov. Bob Ferguson go into force.
A handful of bills became law July 1. Some legislation can take years to go into effect.
Here’s a look at some of the laws on the books starting Sunday.
Clergy
Perhaps the most controversial legislation taking effect Sunday requires religious leaders to report child abuse or neglect, adding them to a list of mandatory reporters that includes school staff, psychologists and many more. 
But a federal judge ruled last week that Catholic priests can’t be mandated to disclose this information if they learn of it in a confession. The ruling came in response to litigation brought by three Catholic bishops over this aspect of the law. The U.S. Justice Department has also waded into the case on the side of the bishops.
For now, the requirement for priests to report suspected abuse or neglect they learn of during confessions is temporarily blocked pending further court proceedings. The rest of the law will take effect.

Police funding
When Ferguson entered office in January, he vowed to only sign a state budget that included $100 million in grants to hire police officers, as Washington ranks last in the country in cops per capita.
House Bill 2015 delivers on that promise, creating the grant program. But a compromise with progressive Democrats will allow the funding to go to more than just bringing aboard more officers.
Peer counselors, behavioral health co-responders, training and other broader public safety efforts are among the other eligible options.
To access the grants, cities and counties need to either implement a new 0.1% sales tax for public safety or have already imposed a similar tax. They also need to follow state model policies as well as collect and report use-of-force data.
The state’s Criminal Justice Training Commission must award the money by June 30, 2028.

Parking
Advocates believe one of the biggest obstacles to building much-needed housing in Washington is local parking requirements that drive up costs and take up valuable space.
A new state law is considered one of the strongest state-level efforts in the nation to relax parking requirements.
Now, cities and counties won’t be able to mandate more than one spot for every two units. They also can’t require builders to include more than one space per single-family home. 
Jurisdictions also can’t force commercial developers to build more than two parking spots per 1,000 square feet.
No parking minimums are allowed for existing buildings converted from nonresidential to residential use, homes under 1,200 square feet, commercial spaces under 3,000 square feet, affordable housing, child care facilities or senior housing. 
The rules don’t affect cities with under 30,000 residents.
Condos
Condominiums can serve as a path into homeownership for first-time buyers. But builders have long shied away from building out of fear of litigation due to the state’s liability laws, seen as overly protective of consumers. 
A new bipartisan law looks to reduce liability risks for developers.
Transit-oriented development
Washington is looking to accelerate the construction of housing near transit, so-called “transit-oriented development.” A new law allows for more dense housing, which Washington desperately needs, while also potentially reducing pollution as more people use buses and rail to commute instead of driving.
The law requires Washington cities to allow housing development near transit.
It also requires 10% of units to be considered affordable and 20% set aside for workforce housing for the next 50 years. The legislation defines affordable as not costing more than 30% of the income for renters who make up 60% of the county’s median income or homeowners who make 80% of the median.
Developers who meet those requirements would get a 20-year multifamily property tax exemption. And they’d get half-off discounts on local impact fees meant to help pay for transportation projects to accommodate the population growth.
While the legislation takes effect Sunday, implementation of the new requirements could come as late as the end of 2029 for cities that updated their comprehensive plans last year. Cities that next revise their plans later than 2024 must follow the new rules within six months of updating. 
Special education
Washington’s public school students will be offered special education services until the end of the school year in which they turn 22 or graduate high school, whichever comes first. The current age limit is 21.
Lawmakers made the change in response to a court ruling from last year that found Washington violated a federal law dealing with how long states must provide “free appropriate public education.”
The Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction estimates 300-1,200 students could benefit from the raised age limit. A fiscal analysis found serving them for an extra year will cost between $6.8 million and $27 million per school year.
Clean fuels
As the federal government steps back from reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Washington wants to double down. 
The state is accelerating its limits on emissions from transportation. By 2038, the state needs to reduce transportation emissions 45% or 55% below 2017 levels. Each year, Washington’s Clean Fuel Standard will now aim for emission drops between 3% and 5%, up from 1% to 1.5%.
The legislation narrowly passed the Legislature amid concerns the change could raise gas prices.
Medical debt
Washingtonians don’t need to worry about medical debt appearing on their credit reports anymore. 
That debt can stop people from getting approved for car or home loans or result in them being denied health care services due to the outstanding bills.
Then-President Joe Biden imposed a similar rule at the federal level, but the Trump administration paused that effort so it never took effect. This week, a federal judge in Texas struck down the federal proposal.
Diapers
One new law looks to increase diaper changing stations. 
The statute now mandates baby diaper changing stations in women’s, men’s, or gender-neutral bathrooms in new public buildings or existing ones that undergo remodels costing $15,000 or more.
Littering 
Washington faces 42% more litter along state roads than the national average, according to a state Department of Ecology report from 2023.
So the state is toughening its littering penalties. A new law raises the punishment from a class three to a class two civil infraction and fines from $50 to $125.
The littering fine applies to amounts up to one cubic foot, or roughly the size of a backpack. 
The fine is in addition to a separate $93 traffic infraction for throwing garbage onto state highways. 
Bail bonds
Lawmakers passed a number of measures this session aimed at protecting immigrants from deportation. 
One stipulates that it is unprofessional conduct for bail bond agents to enforce a civil immigration warrant. The law also prevents agents from sharing immigration information with anyone outside their business. 
Those who violate the law could face disciplinary action from the state Department of Licensing. 
Antitrust
Washington will be the first state in the nation to require companies to notify the state attorney general of a business merger.
Businesses already have to file a premerger notification with the federal government. Attorney General Nick Brown hopes this change will give the state more time to analyze potential anticompetitive consequences from mergers.
The law covers companies based in Washington or that do a certain amount of business here.
“Washington is a trailblazer for the rest of the nation in adopting a premerger notification law,” Brown said in a statement. “This will allow state antitrust enforcers to protect consumer interests in an even more effective way.”
Eid
More than 100,000 Muslims across Washington celebrate Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. Those celebrations are now on the list of the state’s unpaid holidays.
When he signed the bill, Ferguson, the first-term Democratic governor, said Washington is the first state in the country to designate Eid as a state-recognized holiday.
Eid al-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan, and Eid al-Adha the completion of the pilgrimage to Mecca and commemorates the prophet Ibrahim’s willingness to sacrifice his son at God’s request.

Coan’s hiring came at the request of James Mills, the new executive director who joined the board in May. He personally requested Coan for the role, citing staff shortages and a high volume of cases before the board. The previous director, Mike Coan, resigned from his role in January according to the AJC.
The three Trump-aligned members of the board — Janelle King, Janice Johnston and Rick Jeffares — voted to approve Hope Coan over the objections of Chairman John Fervier, who raised questions about her fitness for the role. The final vote was 3-0.
“I do not believe this particular individual meets the necessary qualifications for this job and the hiring process itself was improper,” Fervier told the board ahead of Thursday’s vote.
“That is out of order,” Mills replied. 
Democratic appointee Sara Tindall Ghazal abstained from casting a vote, saying she had not been provided “any information whatsoever about any of the candidates” for the role.
The former CEO of Coan Construction, Hope Coan’s LinkedIn page lists her as the current VP of commercial development at a real estate investment firm. Her profile does not list any paralegal experience, and she has not replied to a request for comment.
Hope Coan will replace former paralegal Alexandra Hardin, who has started a new role with the secretary of state’s office.
The board has weathered a number of controversies since the 2020 election, when President Donald Trump falsely stated that the ​​election was stolen from him in Georgia and several other swing states. Since then, the State Election Board has been deluged by conservative activists urging them to overturn Georgia’s 2020 election results, as well as implement sweeping changes they say will boost confidence in the outcome of the elections, including mandatory ballot hand-counts and the elimination of the state’s voting machines.
At a campaign rally last August, Trump highlighted King, Jeffares and Johnston’s efforts, calling them “pitbulls fighting for honesty, transparency, and victory.” The board later attempted to implement a number of last-minute election rule changes heralded by Trump’s supporters that would have, among other things, mandated hand-counts of ballots, expanded poll-watching areas and given election officials greater leeway to delay election certification. However, those changes were invalidated ahead of the 2024 election by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Thomas A. Cox Jr., who said members of the board were illegally usurping legislative authority.
The board’s next meeting is scheduled for July 29.

The money helps local governments construct public schools and roads. It also helps fund police, firefighting, and search-and-rescue operations.
“The Trump administration is committed to empowering local communities and ensuring that the federal government is a strong partner, not an obstacle,” Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a department press release. “PILT payments support vital services that help rural counties and towns thrive, from public safety to infrastructure and education. We recognize that local governments are the backbone of our nation, and we will continue working to support their efforts to grow local economies and serve their citizens.”
Sixteen Montana counties are slated to receive more than $1 million in federal PILT for 2025.
Flathead County will receive the most —$4,001,549 — for its more than 2.4 million acres of federal land.
Ravalli and Lewis and Clark counties are each slated to receive more than $3.3 million; Missoula, Gallatin and Park counties will receive more than $2 million.
In March, Montana Sen. Steve Daines, a Republican, introduced the “Small County PILT Parity Act” to allow counties with populations under 5,000 to receive increased Payment In Lieu of Taxes (PILT) payments to create parity with larger counties where per capita funding increases as population decreases
“PILT payments are essential for many of Montana’s rural counties, and they provide funding for essential services like emergency response and transportation. I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan bill to bring parity to the PILT program and ensure our rural and low-population counties are treated fairly,” Daines said in a press release at the time.
Daines has previously introduced similar legislation that has not made it through the lawmaking process
Since PILT payments began in 1977, the Interior Department has distributed more than $12.6 billion to states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
The Department collects more than $20.7 billion in revenue annually from commercial activities on public lands. A portion of those revenues is shared with states and counties. The balance is deposited into the U.S. Treasury, which in turn pays for a broad array of federal activities, including PILT payments.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/51355926125_fa9c016e83_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-25 14:56:32.580687

(Amy Dalrymple/North Dakota Monitor)The developer of the Dakota Access Pipeline has asked a North Dakota judge to stop Greenpeace from counter-suing it in the Netherlands.
Energy Transfer says Greenpeace is trying to undermine a March jury verdict that ordered the environmental group to pay the company more than $660 million, finding it responsible for defamation and inciting illegal behavior by anti-pipeline protesters. Greenpeace supported the protests started by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in 2016 against the pipeline’s construction.
Greenpeace denies Energy Transfer’s allegations, and has accused the company of bringing the lawsuit solely out of a desire to punish the environmental group for opposing the pipeline project.
Energy Transfer’s lawsuit is against three Greenpeace entities: Greenpeace International, Greenpeace USA and Greenpeace Fund, its U.S. fundraising arm. Not long before the North Dakota lawsuit went to trial, the Netherlands-based Greenpeace International filed its own lawsuit against Energy Transfer in a Dutch court, arguing Energy Transfer’s legal challenge violated its rights.
Greenpeace seeks reversal of verdict, arguing jury wanted to ‘punish’ someone for pipeline protests

Greenpeace says the case is the first filed under a European Union directive meant to prevent organizations from weaponizing the courts to silence speech they don’t like.
Energy Transfer this week called on Southwest Judicial District Court Judge James Gion to issue an emergency order telling Greenpeace it cannot pursue its lawsuit in the Netherlands as long as the North Dakota case and any appeals are pending.
“This extraordinary measure is necessitated solely by Greenpeace’s bad-faith tactics,” Trey Cox, the lead attorney representing Energy Transfer in the lawsuit, wrote in a Tuesday letter to Gion.
It is “well settled” that American courts can prohibit people under their jurisdiction from suing in other countries, Energy Transfer argued in court records.
Energy Transfer in the filing acknowledged that there are no known instances of a North Dakota court blocking a lawsuit in a foreign country, but added that this doesn’t mean Gion doesn’t have the power to do so.
Stephen Caplow, an attorney representing Greenpeace International in the North Dakota lawsuit, in a Wednesday letter to the judge said Energy Transfer’s allegations about the nature of the Dutch lawsuit lacked any “evidentiary or factual basis.”
He also questioned why the energy company waited until July to request Gion to stop the suit.
“A lawsuit that a party has known about for more than five months is not an ‘emergency,’” Caplow wrote.
He also said Energy Transfer’s court filings make it seem as if all three Greenpeace organizations involved in the North Dakota lawsuit are also parties in the Netherlands case, despite that only Greenpeace International is pursuing the Dutch lawsuit.
 
More Dakota Access Pipeline coverage


Gion has yet to issue a judgment in the North Dakota case. Greenpeace has requested that Gion overturn the jury’s verdict, or at least reduce it. Gion has not yet made a decision on those requests either.
Energy Transfer this week told Gion he should enter a judgment against Greenpeace soon in light of the Dutch lawsuit.
Caplow in his letter said Gion cannot issue a judgment until he sorts out Greenpeace’s motions to throw out or reduce the jury’s verdict. He also wrote the judgment should not be issued “for any reason other than a determination of the merits.”
Greenpeace International will file a more detailed response to Energy Transfer’s motion on Aug. 5, Caplow wrote.
Gion will hear arguments on the motion on Aug. 20.

While the Trump administration[...]","A woman cries after her husband is detained by federal agents during a mandatory immigration check-in in June in New York City.

Santiago/Getty Images).Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.
The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.
Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.
Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.
Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

,DC,2025-07-25 17:45:47+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Former EPA officials say Trump proposal will gut agency’s power to curb emissions,Allison Prang,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/former-epa-officials-say-trump-proposal-will-gut-agencys-power-curb-emissions,,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has submitted a proposal to scrap a years-old finding that greenhouse gas emissions threaten the environment and public health, a move that former agency officials say would gut the EPA’s authority to reduce emissions and is sure to end up in the courts.The EPA sent a draft proposal to the White House late last month calling for scrapping what’s referred to as the endangerment finding on top of vehicle emissions standards for certain cars and trucks. The White House Office of Management and Budget could finish reviewing the draft on Monday and some expect an announcement on the issue the last week of July, Joe Goffman, a former assistant administrator for the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation, said in an interview.Former EPA officials say such a move would gut the agency’s own power to curb greenhouse gas emissions, which have been widely found to cause global warming.“It'll be the most decisive step taken to make the agency totally irrelevant, which then will become an excuse to just get rid of it,” Christine Todd Whitman, the EPA administrator from 2001 to 2003 under President George W. Bush, said in a phone interview.Whitman said she thinks “the long-term goal of all of this is to ensure that the agency can't do regulations.”‘Suffocating its own authority’The EPA finalized what it is known as the endangerment finding in late 2009. It said that greenhouse gases are a threat to both the environment and public health and that emissions from vehicles pollute the air with greenhouse gases. The finding is what obligates the EPA to address greenhouse gas emissions, Goffman said.“Essentially what the EPA is doing is suffocating its own authority under the Clean Air Act…to establish programs and rules to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” said Goffman, who worked at the EPA during the administrations of Democratic Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama.“They’re making it impossible to take steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions” in a deliberate fashion, he said.EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced back in March that the agency was going to reconsider the finding.Its proposal — which was submitted to the executive branch’s Office of Management and Budget on June 30 — will be shared for public comment following interagency review and after Zeldin has signed it, an EPA spokesperson said Thursday in an email.The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment.Court fight aheadThe Trump administration’s moves to scrap the finding and vehicle emissions standards are its latest plays to dial back U.S. climate policy and efforts to fight climate change.President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans scaled back support for renewable energy projects and other climate policies in the budget reconciliation bill signed into law July 4.Trump also signed executive orders during his first days back in office to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement again and to aid fossil fuel production.The EPA said the endangerment finding went beyond the agency’s statutory authority under the Clean Air Act, according to a summary of part of the proposal that was sent to the White House.The Clean Air Act “does not authorize the EPA to prescribe emission standards to address global climate change concerns,” an executive summary of the proposal sent to the White House states, according to an excerpt obtained by States Newsroom.Because of that, the agency is proposing rescinding “the Administrator's findings that GHG emissions from new motor vehicles and engines contribute to air pollution which may endanger public health or welfare,” it said.The agency in its proposal also raises a key 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision in the case of Massachusetts v. EPA that determined the EPA is allowed to regulate greenhouse gases as part of the Clean Air Act because they pollute the air.The EPA argued that the decision doesn’t support how the agency has carried out the Clean Air Act. On top of that, the agency says that the “EPA unreasonably analyzed the scientific record” and that “developments cast significant doubt on the reliability of the findings.”Similar to numerous other executive actions taken by the Trump administration, Whitman and Goffman said they expect this latest move will end up in the courts.“This is the beginning of a long, long saga,” Goffman said.",,,,2025-07-25 13:57:19.419402

Jeff Landry was eager to get the word out this week, welcoming General Motors Insurance to Louisiana in a news release.

Jeff Landry. (Greg LaRose/LAI; Getty Images)Gov. Jeff Landry was eager to get the word out this week, welcoming General Motors Insurance to Louisiana in a news release. The governor described the occasion as “a new milestone in affordable, consumer-focused auto coverage for the state’s drivers.”
“General Motors Insurance coming to Louisiana is a testament to the work we accomplished this legislative session to bring about real insurance reform,” Landry said.
Later in the day, Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple rained on Landry’s parade, noting in his own statement that General Motors Insurance has been doing business in Louisiana since 2006. 
Late last year, GM Insurance submitted a new product to the Louisiana Department of Insurance for its customary review, Temple said. That review took place in February, and the state gave its approval in March. The product became available this month.
There’s clearly more than a dispute over semantics happening between the governor and insurance commissioner. Both Republicans have spent the past several months at odds over how to bring down Louisiana’s auto and home insurance rates. There’s actually common ground between the two in terms of their policy stances, but politics has overshadowed their efforts to curb what’s become an economic development crisis for the state. 
In his statement on General Motors, Landry noted the announcement came just weeks after he signed “the largest tort reform package into law.” Temple largely concurred with the governor’s review, calling it “a handful of great legal reform bills.”
It will be months, if not years, before the true impact of Landry’s legislative package can be ascertained. More salient factors affecting the cost of insurance are out of his control, including how soon Louisiana – or any U.S. locale, for that matter – faces another catastrophic weather event. Poor transportation infrastructure is another issue that won’t change overnight.
Landry can count at least one insurance-related win so far on the legislative front. Against Temple’s wishes, the governor pushed through Act 11, which gives the insurance commissioner  the power to strike down any insurance rate increase considered “excessive” or unreasonably high. That decision can take place without a public hearing to review whether market competition factors should be considered.
Critics of the legislation say what seems like a measure that would favor Temple is actually a move by the governor to potentially place blame on the insurance commissioner if Louisiana doesn’t see an appreciable drop in insurance rates. Temple has said it could also create the impression that he makes rate-increase decisions as political favors, to speak nothing of the message it would send other insurers.
Speaking of which, the way the governor ended his news release could give some the impression he’s giving more than just a friendly welcome to General Motors Insurance. 
It’s common that government agencies provide basic information about a company when making an economic development-related announcement. These details are typically a quick backstory about the business and its presence in the state. 
For General Motors Insurance, Landry’s statement gets into selling points for its coverage, including its “in-vehicle technology … to offer personalized rates based on safe driving habits. “Safer drivers can earn lower premiums along with benefits like accident forgiveness and deductible waivers,” the statement continues, noting that the company offers third-party coverage options for homeowners and renters, “making it easier for Louisianians to bundle and save.” The governor’s office also provided a website link to GM Insurance “to learn more or get a quote.”   
None of this instills great confidence that the governor has made insurance affordability his highest priority. The same goes for the policy changes he and Temple ushered through the legislature. More insurance competition is certainly welcome in Louisiana, but it’s far too soon for either official to claim any wins based on new policy changes while the paint on them is still drying.  
Until lower coverage prices – and not politics – make the news, let’s hope our state leaders don’t pull a muscle trying to pat themselves on the back.

(Courtesy of Sioux Falls School District)I didn’t speak English in kindergarten. I didn’t even start learning it until first grade. And I didn’t really get it until second grade, when I met Mrs. Cavanaugh.
Every week, she would pull three of us out of class — a Vietnamese refugee (me), an Iraqi refugee, and a classmate whose parents had just opened a Mexican restaurant — and bring us into a little room with a round table. That’s where I learned what English could do. Not just how to use it, but how to love it.
That’s where I learned that my family had survived war, and that my classmate’s family had fled violence, too. That’s where we learned to listen to each other’s stories, and feel less alone in our own.
It’s hard to explain how much that meant, but I know what it gave me: everything.
Federal funding uncertainty risks destroying adult education programs in SD, directors say

I eventually transferred to Catholic school, where I got straight A’s, won essay contests, read my writing aloud to rooms full of parishioners, and even had some haikus published in a national anthology. We didn’t have the money to buy the book, so I never told my teacher I couldn’t share it with my mom. She was always working. She learned English the way a lot of immigrants do: on the job, because they can’t afford to take a class.
By sixth grade, I gave the class commencement speech. Same thing in eighth grade. In high school, I competed at nationals for speech and became editor of the paper. My senior year superlative was “most likely to be president,” even though I was one of the few who could never be.
All of that started in a small room at Anne Sullivan Elementary. It started with a public school teacher who saw us, and gave us the tools to see ourselves.
That’s why it hurts to see lawmakers work to dismantle the federal Department of Education and freeze billions in funding meant for schools like mine. The department doesn’t dictate curriculum. What it actually does is distribute federal support for low-income students, multilingual learners, special education services, and civil rights protections in schools. These programs exist so that kids like me can find their footing.
After nationwide outcry, the department recently released a portion of the frozen funds, roughly $1.3 billion, targeted specifically at after-school and summer learning programs. That’s an important step, especially for working families who rely on these programs for safe, enriching environments outside of regular classroom hours. But more than $5 billion in other critical education funding remains on hold. That includes support for teacher training, English language services, migrant education, adult literacy and student enrichment programs — resources that help kids thrive during the school day, not just after.
Here in the Sioux Falls School District, the impact is still unfolding. Of the anticipated $3.5 million shortfall, only about $250,000 has been restored so far — enough to support after-school tutoring. Core staffing plans will remain in place this year, but some non-staff initiatives like professional development, supplemental programs and contracted services have been paused. While English learner support staff will continue, the district says further program expansion may be limited without additional funding. Special education and mental health services aren’t directly impacted by the freeze, but flexible funding that could have enhanced or expanded those supports has been lost — for now. The district, like many others, is still waiting for additional guidance from the state and federal government.

I wouldn’t be here without that support. And I worry deeply for the kids who won’t get what I got. The kids who won’t have a Mrs. Cavanaugh. The kids who will never find their way to the words that could change their lives.
And even worse than the cuts is the silence. The silence from leaders who know better. Who know that children like me can thrive when they’re cared for, but choose to look the other way. I’ve spent years ghostwriting for admirable leaders. But lately I’ve started to wonder what good that’s done if they’re quiet now — if they won’t fight for what saved me, and eventually benefitted them.
Children aren’t resources to be groomed. They’re not workers-in-waiting. They’re not numbers in a cost-benefit analysis. They’re kids. And if they feel loved and respected, they’ll pay that forward a hundred times over. I’m proof of that and I am far from alone.
I don’t know where my classmates from that little roundtable ended up. But if I had to bet, I’d bet long on them. Just like I’d bet on that quiet 6-year-old me.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Central Iowa Water Works is phasing out of its first-ever lawn watering ban, which has been in place since June 12 on account of sustained high nitrate levels in source water rivers. 
A comparison of nitrate levels in the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers, which feed plants in the CIWW system, shows nitrate levels were elevated nearly 40 more days in 2025 than in 2024. 
Utilities must keep nitrate concentration levels below 10 milligrams per liter to remain compliant with safe drinking water standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This becomes difficult to fulfill when both demand on the system and nitrate concentrations in the source water are high. 
 


Tami Madsen, CIWW’s executive director, said there are many factors that make 2025 worse, in terms of dealing with nitrate, than 2024. In addition to sustained, elevated levels in the rivers, the infiltration gallery at the Des Moines Water Works’ Fleur Treatment Plant has also been elevated. The infiltration gallery is a series of underground pipes that collects alluvial ground water through more than three miles in Water Works Park.
Beginning around June 8, 2025, all three of these sources were above 10 mg/L, meaning the plant couldn’t pull from less concentrated sources to dilute the higher concentrations.

Voluntary and then mandatory lawn watering bans were issued to significantly reduce demand on the system. The reduced demand meant CIWW facilities could process enough water within the federal limits to remain compliant. 
Voluntary water restrictions were issued last summer as well, which along with dropping concentrations in the Des Moines River by early July, relieved the system. 
Madsen said the system this year was also stressed because the timing of the nitrate peaks coincided with lawn watering season, which represents up to 40 million gallons of demand per day.
 


“This year is different from any other year in that all three of our water sources at the Fleur Drive Plant – the Raccoon River, the Des Moines River, and the infiltration gallery, were significantly higher than 10mg/L for 33 days between June 8 to July 15,” Madsen said. “This coincides with the time frame that water uses typically increases for the summer season.”
Finished water leaving the treatment plants has remained within the federal safe drinking water standards, or below 10 mg/L. High-nitrate water can lead to shortness of breath and blue-baby syndrome if consumed by infants. 
Some environmental groups and research however, hold that this standard might be outdated and that adverse health outcomes can occur from continued consumption of water with nitrate concentrations below the federal limit. They argue there are links to cancers, pre-term deliveries or birth defects.  
Water output from the L.D. McMullen Water Treatment Plant had finished water with concentrations above 5 mg/L from March 31, 2024, until July 25, 2024. The highest concentration during that more than 117 day period was 8.6 mg/L and the average was about 7.1 mg/L.
Finished water concentrations stretched higher than 5 mg/L in 2025 at the L.D. McMullen plant beginning March 15, 2025 and have not yet dropped below that mark. Since March 15, the average level has been 7.2 mg/L.








At the Fleur plant, nitrate concentrations remained above 5 mg/L from April 4, 2024 through July 29, 2024. The plant had a total of 117 days during the spring and summer with outputs higher than 5 mg/L and a high during the period of  8.97 mg/L. The average during the period was 7.48 mg/L.



According to Melissa Walker with Central Iowa Water Works, the nitrate removal facility ran for 68 days in 2024. As of Thursday, the removal facility has been running for 97 days in 2025. 
The database for Des Moines Water Works does not log river data every day so there are fewer data points for the rivers compared to output from the facilities. 
In 2024, the Raccoon River was above 10 mg/L for 64 days during the March-August time frame. 
Levels rose above 10 mg/L on March 29, 2024, and remained above 10 mg/L, with periodic dips no lower than 7 mg/L until July 15, 2024. The average concentration in the river during this time period was 12.98 mg/L and the highest recorded concentration was 18.2 mg/L. 
The Des Moines River did not have concentrations above 10 mg/l until April 29, 2024, though levels fluctuated from about 5 mg/L to 9 mg/L for the early part of April. In total, the Des Moines River had 41 days with concentrations above 10 mg/L. 
During this time of elevated levels, the average concentration was 12.79, and the highest concentration measured 15.56 mg/L.
 


In 2025, levels in the Raccoon River first rose above 10 mg/L March 25 and remained above the federal limit through July 18, with 16 days during the period where levels dipped between 6 and 9 mg/L following significant rain events. 
During the 91 day period of elevation, the average level was 12.82 mg/L with a maximum of 19.39 mg/L. 
Nitrate levels in the Des Moines River didn’t jump above 10 mg/L until April 10 this year. Levels remained elevated above 10 mg/L until July 18, aside from periodic drops to around 8 mg/L following significant rain events. 
The maximum recorded concentration in the Des Moines River was 16.6 mg/L this year and the average concentration during the 80-day period was 11.9 mg/L. There were 12 days during the period of elevation where levels dipped below 10 mg/L. 
CIWW started the phased-in end to the lawn watering ban on Tuesday, following sustained downward trends in the source water nitrate concentrations. Under the phased-in approach, even numbered houses can water their lawns Sundays, Wednesdays and Fridays and odd numbered houses can water on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)Union County’s manager said officials will not permit the county jail to be used for immigrant detention, ending months of speculation and community concern that the largely shuttered property would be sold to a for-profit prison company for immigration enforcement.
County Manager Edward Oatman said officials never intended such a use when in March they authorized a request for proposals to repurpose the old jail. They merely aimed to evaluate potential uses for the property, he added.
“While one inquiry did reference the possibility of detention-related use, we quickly recognized that such a direction would not align with Union County’s values,” Oatman said in a Thursday statement. “Given the troubling reports we’ve seen nationwide about ICE detaining not only individuals with criminal charges, but also everyday people simply trying to build better lives, we cannot support any outcome that risks putting people in jeopardy. This process was never about immigration detention, and we remain firmly opposed to any such use.”
County officials closed most operations at the 1,000-bed jail in 2021, and it is now primarily used as a temporary holding facility for arrestees who are quickly transferred to other jails. In March, Oatman said demolishing it would cost tens of millions of dollars, and repurposing it could cost millions per floor, so officials opted to sell and hoped a request for proposals would draw a diverse group of bidders from a variety of industries.
Since it became clear the jail would be sold, the county has received several informal inquiries “with a wide range of ideas coming in from various sectors,” including one inquiry for “detention-related use,” Oatman said. But the request for proposals hasn’t been finalized or issued, so the county hasn’t received any formal proposals, he added.
Oatman vowed to prioritize transparency, public input, and residents’ long-term needs in deciding the jail’s fate.
“As County Manager, I have a duty to pursue opportunities that serve the best interests of Union County — financially, socially, and morally,” he said. “We are continuing with the RFP process, but we want to be absolutely clear: the RFP will include language that prohibits any use of the site as a private detention facility, such as an ICE facility, immigration detention center, or similar operation. Those uses are off the table.”
The announcement comes as the Trump administration’s budget for immigration enforcement has ballooned and immigration raids have ramped up across New Jersey and the nation. The budget bill President Donald Trump recently signed included $45 billion to build new immigration jails and hire 10,000 new immigration enforcement agents. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have historically targeted New Jersey for enforcement, with more than 32,000 arrests out of ICE’s Newark field office between October 2020 and December 2024, according to ICE statistics.
Oatman’s announcement also came two days after a federal appeals court ruled that New Jersey cannot ban private companies from contracting with the federal government to detain immigrants — a major blow to the state’s efforts to limit immigration detention here.
Immigration advocates celebrated Oatman’s announcement, cheering the community pressure that he saluted in his statement. Advocates and county residents have held multiple rallies, packed the commissioners’ meetings, and testified against using the jail for immigrant detention, instead urging officials to invest in housing, mental health services, and community infrastructure.
Make the Road New Jersey applauded Union County and other public officials around New Jersey for standing up to federal efforts to expand immigration enforcement.
“It is important to note that what remains unchanged is the state of New Jersey’s ability to prevent its subdivisions from allowing their facilities to be used for immigration detention,” the group said in a statement.

You can read more about the section here. Additionally, Mississippi Today is proud to have moved its offices to downtown Jackson in early June. Read more about our decision here.

When Kumar Bhavanasi purchased the historic Deposit Guaranty Building and adjacent Pinnacle Building in downtown Jackson recently, it affirmed a message of optimism that many of us have been communicating for a while.
In the two high-rise structures, Bhavanasi, a developer from New Jersey, saw the vast potential of Mississippi’s central business district and burgeoning residential neighborhood. It mirrored  the vision of Jackson residents and many others across the state who see the potential lying in wait. In so many ways, our downtown is an artist’s canvas, just beginning to be painted.
“There is something beautiful about a blank canvas,” an author wrote. “It’s the paint that changes its meaning and the hand that creates the story. Every piece begins the same, but in the end they are uniquely different.”

Downtown is, indeed, different from any other place — in Jackson, in Mississippi and in the nation.  Two hundred years of history have helped make it so.  We are a center of government, a business hub, a political seat, a residential quarter, an arts and  entertainment venue and a gathering place. Downtown Jackson is the capital of Mississippi, a title that is not likely to ever change.
Given all that, the question of whether to put every effort into making downtown better than it’s ever been over two centuries has already been answered. The wheels to make that happen — to transform downtown into a paragon — already are moving. And now it’s augmented by fresh, imaginative leadership at City Hall.
Consider: 

Safety, once an issue here, has been dramatically improved with the expansion of Capitol police in downtown. With a new headquarters near the state Capitol, more patrols and greater communication with businesses and residents, these officers have sent a message that downtown will be secure. With our new mayor now in office, we expect that to improve even more with the help of Jackson police. Citizen confidence is our goal, and we will bolster that further with additional security measures to be announced soon.


Residential space, which has transformed many downtowns in neighboring states, is being expanded in Jackson to accommodate the increasing numbers of people who see our downtown as a unique and safe place to live and work. That includes developer Bhavanasi’s planned apartments for the 18-story Deposit Guaranty Building with its beautiful early 20th century architecture. Currently, about 700 people call downtown home. With more residents will come more ancillary businesses such as a grocery store, new restaurants and entertainment sites. We are a growing neighborhood in the center of Jackson. 


New quality-of-life projects to enhance our capital district and truly make it “Mississippi’s Downtown” are moving quickly. Construction of a new state park just north of the historic Old Capitol Building and overlooking our renowned Two Mississippi Museums is underway. Meanwhile, major improvements are being planned for Smith Park, one of the oldest city parks in America and a jewel in the heart of downtown. A few blocks away, construction is wrapping up on Jackson’s all-new, state-of-the-art planetarium, which is expected to attract residents from across the state and beyond. And Thalia Mara Hall, home to the International Ballet Competition, will soon re-open its doors with more improvements as the district’s arts anchor. 

These are just a few of the efforts and projects underway to make downtown Jackson a reflection of  who we are as Mississippians.
For me, it’s been a 35-year commitment to this city that led to Downtown Jackson Partners as its new president. The sense of pride and ownership in Jackson that I feel is something I want to encourage and cultivate in others. Our future rides on an expectation that we will thrive.
A vibrant capital city is tantamount to a dynamic state. Downtown is at the heart of it all. Downtown belongs to each of us. Downtown is our canvas to paint.

Amid recent political rhetoric about rising crime and violence in American cities, a new analysis shows that violent crime has continued to decline this year.
Homicides and several other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, dropped during the first half of 2025 across 42 U.S. cities, continuing a downward trend that began in 2022, according to a new crime trends report released Thursday by the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
Homicides fell 17% in the first half of 2025, compared with the same period in 2024, among the 30 cities that reported homicide data, according to the report.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
During that same period, five cities saw increases in homicide — ranging from 6% in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to 39% in Little Rock, Arkansas.
While the report’s authors say the continued drop in violent crime — especially homicides — is encouraging, they note that much of the decline stems from a few major cities with historically high rates, such as Baltimore and St. Louis.
More than half of the cities studied have higher homicide rates than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, though, the analysis found that there were 14% fewer homicides during the first half of 2025 compared to the same period in 2019.
The authors say more research is needed before crediting any specific policy or practice for the continued drop in violent crime.
The group’s findings come as President Donald Trump continues to amplify concerns about crime, at times citing misleading statistics and narratives.

In a Truth Social post earlier this week, Trump claimed that cashless bail — a practice that allows people charged with a crime to be released pretrial without paying money, unless a judge deems them a threat to public safety — were fueling a national crime surge and endangering law enforcement.
He wrote: “Crime in American Cities started to significantly rise when they went to CASHLESS BAIL. The WORST criminals are flooding our streets and endangering even our great law enforcement officers. It is a complete disaster, and must be ended, IMMEDIATELY!”
Some research suggests that setting money bail isn’t effective in ensuring court appearances or improving public safety. Opponents of ending cash bail often raise concerns that released suspects might commit new, potentially more serious crimes. While that is possible in individual cases, studies show that eliminating cash bail does not lead to a widespread increase in crime.
The Truth Social post also marked a sharp shift from Trump’s remarks during a June roundtable with the Fraternal Order of Police, where he claimed the national murder rate had “plummeted by 28%” since he took office — a figure that overstates the decline and overlooks the fact that murder rates began falling well before he returned to office.
According to data consulting firm AH Datalytics, which manages the Real-Time Crime Index — a free tool that collects crime data from more than 400 law enforcement agencies nationwide — the number of homicides between January and May 2025 was 20.3% lower than the same period in 2024.
Similarly, data released in May by the Major Cities Chiefs Association showed that homicides fell roughly 20% in the first quarter of 2025 compared with the first three months of the prior year. The group’s data is based on a survey of 68 major metropolitan police departments nationwide.
Researchers at the Council on Criminal Justice note in their report that it’s difficult to pinpoint a single reason for the drop in homicides, but they note that fewer people appear to be exposed to high-risk situations, such as robberies.
Most major crimes fell in the first half of 2025 compared with the same period last year, according to the council’s report.
Motor vehicle thefts dropped by 25%, while reported gun assaults fell 21%. Robberies, residential and non-residential burglaries, shoplifting, and aggravated and sexual assaults also saw double-digit declines
Drug offenses held steady, while domestic violence reports rose slightly — by about 3%. Carjackings declined 24% and larcenies were down 5%.
Compared with the first half of 2019, before the pandemic and nationwide reckoning over racial justice and policing, overall homicides are down 14%, robberies by 30%, and sexual assaults by 28%.
Still, more than 60% of the cities in the council’s study sample report homicide rates that remain above 2019 levels.
Motor vehicle theft remains the only crime tracked in the report that is still elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels — up 25% since 2019 — although it has declined sharply since 2023.
The council also released another analysis on the lethality of violent crime, showing that while violent incidents have decreased, the share of violence that ends in death has increased significantly. In 1994, there were 2 homicides per 1,000 assaults and about 16 per 1,000 robberies. By 2020, those figures rose to 7.2 and 55.8, respectively.

(Photo by Ken Castro/Rhode Island Current)The Mount Hope Bridge has secured a $17 million federal grant to upgrade its aging cables, the Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority (RITBA) confirmed this week.
The funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation allows RITBA to move forward with a dehumidification project aimed at reducing corrosion on the supports of the 96-year-old bridge connecting Bristol and Portsmouth over Mount Hope Bay.
They’re upgrades RITBA Executive’s Director Lori Caron Silveira called “essential.”
“Dehumidifying the Mount Hope Bridge cables and anchorages is essential to arresting the corrosion of the individual wires in the cables and we are excited to bring this technology to our nearly 100-year-old bridge,” Silveira said in a statement. “We are confident that it will help to extend the life of this landmark by 50 to 75 years.”
The money for the project comes as RITBA prepares to temporarily close the bridge for four days next month for a $1 million repaving operation.
The Mount Hope Bridge funding was announced by Rhode Island’s U.S. Senate delegation in April 2024, but whether the state would actually receive that money was in doubt after President Donald Trump froze the grant not long after taking office to make sure all federal spending aligned with his new administration’s priorities.
“It is about time that the Trump Administration released its unnecessary hold on these already awarded funds,” U.S. Sen. Jack Reed said in a statement.
The multi-year dehumidification project will also draw from a $10 million Congressional Directed Spending allocation.
When dehumidification is slated to begin it is still up in the air. RITBA spokesperson Cara Cromwell said officials are in the midst of reviewing the three bids the agency received after closing its request for proposals on June 6.
Last year, RIBTA conducted cable air flow testing on the bridge, which Cromwell said was done by Kiewit Infrastructure Company at a cost of more than $1.26 million.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-25 16:45:35+00:00,CT Mirror,"To offer modest electric relief, CT to borrow $155 million",Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/25/electric-rate-relief-ct/,Consumers could see savings between $4 and $10 based on electric usage and other factors in the monthly bills beginning in September.,"Gov. Ned Lamont said Friday he has scheduled a vote next week by the State Bond Commission on $155 million in borrowing to deliver the modest and temporary electric-rate relief authorized last month by the General Assembly.
Based on early estimates from the industry and governor’s office, most consumers could see savings between $4 and $10 based on usage and other factors in the monthly bills beginning in September.
The borrowing is an element of the omnibus Senate Bill 4 energy legislation passed with overwhelming support last month. It would offset a portion of the public benefits charge in monthly bills.
The public benefits charge is a levy on ratepayers for programs that, among other things, provide financial assistance for low-income customers and encourage energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives.
It also contributes to the cost of providing a stable rate for the carbon-free power generated by the Millstone nuclear plant. The cost of generating power is largely set by a competitive market dominated by natural gas-fired plants, which currently is cheaper than nuclear.
“Using state bond funding as a means of reducing public benefits charges is one action we can take to provide some savings on consumers’ electric bills, but I must stress that this is only one step in the effort to make energy rates more affordable and we need to do more to address the actual costs of generating and delivering electricity,” Lamont said in a statement.
Connecticut and other northeastern states, which sit at the end of natural gas pipelines, have the highest electric rates in the continental U.S. Since the deregulation of power generation, state regulators and the two major utilities have limited control over rates.
Regulators set the portion of the bill covering the distribution of electricity to homes and businesses, which includes the costs of maintaining and modernizing the infrastructure owned by Eversource and United Illuminating.
The high cost of electricity, the reliability of its generation and delivery, the adequacy of supply and the oversight by state regulators all have been elements of legislative and administration efforts toward reforms since 2020.
Subsidizing the public benefits charges comes as other factors are driving down costs, notably reductions in supply rates of 13% for Eversource and 14% for United Illumination, effective July 1. Rate adjustments approved in May by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority also cut the public benefits charge.
Of the $155 million in bonding to be approved by the Bond Commission on Aug. 1, $125 million will reduce costs associated with hardship programs for low-income customers and $30 million will be used to reduce the costs associated with the electric vehicle charging program.
Another round of state borrowing expected in 2026 would enable the savings to continue into at least the first several months of 2027, the governor’s office said.
Republicans initially had sought a much more expansive and energy package that would have cost roughly $1 billion a year to eliminate the public benefits charge entirely. But the votes for SB 4 were nearly unanimous: 144-3 in the House, and 34-1 in the Senate.
In a statement issued quickly after Lamont’s announcement Friday, Senate Republicans said gutting the public benefits charge remans their goal: “Merely reducing the hidden public benefits tax is not nearly enough. Republicans will continue pushing to totally eliminate those public benefits charges from electric bills.”
Lamont noted the bipartisan support for SB 4 and promised efforts to lower prices will continue: “I am encouraged that we can continue this cooperative effort and develop policies that will produce additional savings for consumers.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Utility_Lines-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-25 12:56:51.441736
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-25 16:29:16+00:00,CT Mirror,Document gives glimpse into CT negotiations on H.B. 5002 changes,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/25/ct-hb-5002-changes-negotiations/,A draft document shows early negotiations on a new version of CT House Bill 5002 go beyond talk of fair share and parking regulation changes.,"Early negotiations on a new version of an omnibus housing bill have touched on more than many advocates expected and far beyond the controversial zoning and parking measures noted by Gov. Ned Lamont as concerns when he vetoed last session’s version earlier this summer, a legislative document obtained by The Connecticut Mirror shows.
After initially saying he’d sign House Bill 5002, Democratic lawmakers’ key housing bill, Lamont vetoed it under pressure from Republicans and town leaders who feared the bill weakened local control and imposed one-size-fits-all solutions on municipalities. After the veto, lawmakers and the governor’s office began negotiating a new bill for a special session in the fall.
In negotiations on major bills, there are often several drafts of legislation. The CT Mirror obtained a June 30 analysis from the Office of Legislative Research of one of those drafts. The document offers a rare look at conversations occurring in these closed-door negotiations.
Publicly, Lamont has cited as concerns a portion of the bill known as “fair share” that would have required towns to plan and zone for a set number of units and a measure to eliminate off-street parking requirements for smaller residential developments. 
But the document shows ideas for changes have ranged beyond those pieces to include changes to sections to encourage more housing development around train and bus stations, conversion of commercial buildings to residential and one of the state’s foremost housing laws, 8-30g.
Lawmakers said the conversation has evolved far past the June document, and that it doesn’t reflect more current drafts. House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said he didn’t want to get into specifics of the current negotiations.
“It was part of conversations that were going on and ideas that were being thrown out there,” Rojas said of the document. “Some of it still might be kind of part of our conversation, some of it not.”
“This was a point-in-time document, and I don’t feel like it’s reflective of where we are,” Rojas said. “This is far more complicated than where we are right now in terms of the major items that we’re focused on, that we continue to exchange language on.”
Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, said he and Rojas are “on the same page,” on policy.
“We’re at a high level right now, and we’re working through some issues, but I don’t want to go too far into what we’re talking about right now,” Duff said.
Lamont met earlier this week with policy leaders from the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities to discuss solutions to the state’s housing crisis, and his staff has seen the document.
The original bill aimed to address rising housing costs that have become unaffordable for much of the state’s population. Connecticut has not built enough housing over the past several years, which has resulted in a lack of supply amid high demand.
Housing experts have tied much of this lack of supply to restrictive local zoning that makes it hard to build multifamily housing on much of Connecticut’s land.
Where fair share and a policy to encourage transit-oriented development known as “Work, Live, Ride,” were once fairly separate, the June 30 document discusses tying them together through a new system of awarding municipalities points if they take steps to build more housing.
There would be one point each for five criteria, including transit-oriented development and adopting “priority housing development” zones. The idea, like others in the document, has been proposed in the past, Rojas said.
“People are taking ideas that have been considered in the past and seeing if they might work in this situation,” he said.
In H.B. 5002, Work, Live, Ride prioritized certain infrastructure funding for towns that prioritized transit-oriented development.
Rojas said the idea was to respond to criticism that there were too many options for towns in the bill.
“Is there a way to ensure that all the products, all the parts, can work together better than perhaps some other people otherwise think they will?” he said.
The proposal also includes changes to the fair share portion. Towns would be responsible to plan and zone for a quarter of their allotted number of units of housing in the first 10 years of planning. Previously, it had been every five years.
Towns could appeal their assignments, and the document says the draft would “substantially change” that process, although the details aren’t clear.
H.B. 5002 would have removed minimum parking requirements for residential developments of less than 24 units. Negotiations have included an idea to allow towns to impose parking requirements on a case-by-case basis in village districts, historic districts or rural conservation areas.
The bill that was vetoed also would have allowed the conversion of commercial properties into middle housing, or apartments with two to nine units, without a special hearing before the local zoning commission.
The June document suggests continuing that, but making the developments subject to a “summary review process” done by the town that can consider whether the property conforms with regulations around lot size, how much of the building’s side faces the public street and how far the building is set back from the road.
For each of these middle housing developments, and mixed-use developments, meaning buildings that incorporate both housing and places of business, towns would also have easier pathways to moratoriums under 8-30g.
That law offers developers court remedies if towns deny their affordable housing proposals and means the towns must prove in court that they turned down the housing because of a reason of health or safety. Towns are exempt if at least 10% of their housing is designated affordable, and can get moratoriums on the law if they show they are making progress toward that 10%.
The early draft also would allow the summary review process for turning nursing homes into housing, marking a change to an existing law. Democrats passed a bill in 2024 that required towns to allow developers to turn nursing homes into housing without needing a change to zoning law.

The Connecticut Capitol served as a backdrop, framed by tents, picnic tables, and rows of folding chairs. Some people nodded along quietly, holding their fresh squeezed lemonade. Others danced from side to side, making Sunday’s event feel like a neighborhood party featuring world class musicians.

“There’s people from different economic backgrounds, from different racial backgrounds, different religious backgrounds, all sitting together, enjoying the music, and that’s one of the beauties of something in a public space like Bushnell Park, where everybody’s just equals there,” said Chuck Obuchowski, WWUH jazz radio announcer and broadcaster of the festival for more than 30 years.
Last weekend, Bushnell Park welcomed almost 70,000 spectators to enjoy live music performed by local, national and international artists. 
For more than three decades, the Greater Hartford Festival of Jazz has offered not just a concert series to the city, but also an open egalitarian space: free, outdoors and welcoming to all. 
The first festival, held in July 1991, was dedicated to the 25th anniversary of Paul Brown’s Monday night jazz series, the longest running free jazz concert series in the United States. The series, which is still held each summer, runs until Aug. 11 this year.

A festival that feels like home
The festival has grown to be the largest free jazz event in New England, and a world-class event that Hartford residents can enjoy right in the green heart of the city.
Hartford resident Brendan Alexander, who lives in the city’s North End, has attended the festival since he was a child. Now at 18 years old, he sees it as a reflection of Hartford’s culture.
“To me, people and the culture in Hartford, is like the best thing that we have, because everybody connects and supports each other,” Alexander said.
Internationally recognized jazz vocalist and composer, Michelle Coltrane, 65, the stepdaughter of the famous jazz saxophonist John Coltrane, performed at the festival for the first time this year. Michelle Coltrane, accustomed to large venues like the Hollywood Bowl, loved Bushnell Park’s neighborly vibe and multigenerational audience.

“It’s important to have these outdoor venues that have a very broad mix of [music]… having the kids come and the older people like, ‘Yeah, I know that song from 50 years ago,’” Coltrane said. 
Steven Thomas has been volunteering for three years at the festival. A blues artist, poet, bass guitar player and North End native, Thomas sees the festival as an equitable space for locals.
“Man, it’s really important. I mean, the rich guys, they got country clubs they could go to…with stuff like this we all get together,” said Thomas. “Hartford needs this.”

The people who make it happen
Thomas is one of many Hartford-based volunteer staff members that make the festival happen. Some, like Thomas, perform in local bands. For others, like security staff member Valerie Taylor, the event is a vehicle for belonging and memories.
Taylor’s mother, who used to be a jazz singer, took her for the first time to the festival when she was a middle school student living in Southwest Hartford. Now, at 69 years old, she enjoys the backstage chaos and the community that make this event happen. 
“To see all the people and the families from when I grew up, a lot of them were out in the audience, and my high school buddies were here, it’s amazing.”
Alvin Carter, stage and festival production manager, Hartford native and band leader, believes jazz is still a force shaping the city’s social and cultural heartbeat.
“People have been saying jazz is dying for decades. It’s not dying. It’s just not as well funded as it used to be,” Carter said.

Music as a binder in hard times
The festival is powered by the steady commitment of local residents who see music as more than entertainment.
Maurice Robertson, Hartford Jazz Society board member, jazz photographer, and 49-year volunteer radio announcer at WWUH, looks at the jazz scene in Hartford as a continuum and events like the festival as the social glue for people.
“These are opportunities for people to have joy, to break bread with each other, and to be neighborly, the music inspires and unifies, rallies us,” Robertson said. “These are very difficult times, so these free concert opportunities help folks to transcend some of the negativity that is constant.”

Even as crowds filled the park, staff members walked across the audience with donation buckets. The festival is free to the public but not free to run, something Charles Christie, president of the Greater Hartford Festival of Jazz, knows well.
Christie looks forward to getting a paid executive director position so next generations get motivated to keep the festival going.
Having organized events like the jazz festival and the Keney Park family day for almost 30 years, Christie has a passion for the city of Hartford, for music and bringing people together.

(Margaret Mellott/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Emporia State University President Ken Hush announced his retirement Thursday, nodding at past and future challenges in higher education.
Hush, an Emporia State graduate, wrote in an email to alumni, staff and students that his last day will be Dec. 17. He plans to stay involved, he said.
“For more than a decade, higher education has faced significant challenges and pressure to change – this will not only continue but will increase in the future,” he wrote. “There will be winners and losers. Those who are able to adjust will survive; those who don’t won’t… without additional funding.”
Hush’s tenure lasted around four years, beginning in late 2021. He served those early months as interim president. Not long after the Kansas Board of Regents officially named Hush as Emporia State’s 18th president in June 2022, the university fired 30 tenured or tenure-track professors to cut costs. Hush signed the professors’ termination letters while offering bonuses to others.
Eleven of the fired professors sued Hush and others in 2023 in federal court.
Before he worked as a university president, Hush was a business executive who worked in top-level positions at Koch Minerals and Carbon. He has two daughters, both of whom live in Michigan. He graduated from Emporia State in 1982, majoring in business administration and marketing and playing on the nationally-ranked men’s tennis team.
During Hush’s tenure, Emporia State faced declining enrollment and increasing demand for online courses, which he said “created outdated organizations, inefficiencies and waste which caused deficits and financial instability for institutions across the nation.”
However, the university has turned a corner, Hush said. He called the past few years “the most transformative era” in the university’s history.
Enrollment increased 16% at Emporia State last year, and the university was the only one in the state that has not raised tuition in the past two years.
“We established a unique mentality and have completely changed our culture from the top down and from the bottom up,” he said. “Our leadership team has been re-educated and now operates from a lens of data, analysis, financial responsibility and accountability.”
Hush touted bringing in $30 million to correct a $19 million budget deficit, creating an organization that is “fiscally clean, operationally efficient and organizationally sound.” On two occasions, the Kansas Legislature earmarked millions for Emporia State: $9 million in 2023 and another $9 million in 2024.

(Getty Images)Only about one in four New Mexico students are proficient in math, according to a Legislative Education Study Committee brief presented to members Thursday.
Members of the LESC met in Las Vegas this week on the New Mexico Highlands University campus. Thursday’s agenda included the topic of math proficiency in the state, which has remained steadily low. LESC Deputy Director Jessica Hathaway pointed out to lawmakers that this trend of low math proficiency in New Mexico is also evident across the country.
According to the brief, U.S. students’ math performance declined “significantly” between 2018 and 2022, while reading and science scores remained steady. The brief cites the Program for International Student Assessment, an assessment conducted internationally every three years that measures reading, math and science literacy of 15-year-olds. 
The U.S. placed 26th out of 81 in the 2022 assessment, the most recently conducted, while the country placed sixth in reading and 10th in science. 
“Math proficiency peaks in fifth grade in New Mexico, where we see a 32% proficiency rate. But you also see this line drop right after that point,” Hathaway said during the meeting. “By the end of middle school, in eighth grade, we see a 19% proficiency rate across all student groups. And by 11th grade, we see a 12% proficiency rate across all student groups.”
Hathaway detailed how other states in the country have started to address their own math systems through legislation and practice. Common threads include universal math screening at early ages to catch dyscalculia and other possible learning difficulties; intervention plans for at-risk students; high-quality learning materials; professional development and teacher preparation programs; and improving parent engagement.
She also pointed out that several of these components were included in Senate Bill 235, introduced by Sen. Bill Soules (D-Las Cruces) during the recent session; however, the bill died in committee. At the time, the bill was described as a similar approach to math as structured literacy is to reading. 
Sen. Gabriel Ramos (R-Silver City) asked whether there is a program or method of education for math that would mimic structured literacy. The LESC brief noted that there is not a universal “science of math” program.
“What we’re seeing is that states are actually having to create those training programs, so that’s what we mean whenever we say there’s not a clean science of math,” Hathaway said. “That being said, one part I do want to pull out is that there is a very, very substantial body of research about effective math instruction that can inform policy.”
The brief provided a list of recommendations for the state Legislature, the New Mexico Public Education Department, teacher preparation programs and school districts, which include the state codifying expectations for math instruction, screening and intervention; the PED revising teacher licensure requirements; preparation programs requiring math methods coursework for all licensure pathways; and districts investing in math coaches or interventionists and engaging parents as partners in students’ learning. 
Soules, a former math teacher and chair of the LESC, said he was encouraged by the end of the discussion Thursday, “because it’s not something we dig into as we’re very, very focused on the reading side of things.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/kidmathGettyImages-80357061-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-07-25 12:56:51.441736

As many as 27% of US Forest Service jobs remain vacant as of July 17, according to a Pro Publica analysis.
Despite the Trump administration’s public pronouncements that it has hired enough wildland firefighters, documents obtained by ProPublica show a high vacancy rate, as well as internal concern among top officials as more than 1 million acres burn across 10 states.


This story was originally published by ProPublica.

	
Less than a month ago, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced that the Trump administration had done a historically good job preparing the nation for the summer fire season. “We are on track to meet and potentially exceed our firefighting hiring goals,” said Rollins, during an address to Western governors. Rollins oversees the wildland firefighting workforce at the U.S. Forest Service, a subagency of the Department of Agriculture. Rollins had noted in her remarks that the administration had exempted firefighters from a federal hiring freeze, and she claimed that the administration was outdoing its predecessor: “We have reached 96% of our hiring goal, far outpacing the rate of hiring and onboarding over the past three years and in the previous administration.”
Since then, the Forest Service’s assertions have gotten even more optimistic: The agency now claims it has reached 99% of its firefighting hiring goal.
But according to internal data obtained by ProPublica, Rollins’ characterization is dangerously misleading. She omitted a wave of resignations from the agency this spring and that many senior management positions remain vacant. Layoffs by the Department of Government Efficiency, voluntary deferred resignations and early retirements have severely hampered the wildland firefighting force. According to the internal national data, which has not been previously reported, more than 4,500 Forest Service firefighting jobs — as many as 27% — remained vacant as of July 17. A Forest Service employee who is familiar with the data said it comes from administrators who input staffing information into a computer tool used to create organization charts. The employee said that while the data could contain inaccuracies in certain forests, it broadly reflects the agency’s desired staffing levels. The employee said the data showing “active” unfilled positions was “current and up-to-date for last week.”
The Department of Agriculture disputes that assessment, but the figures are supported by anecdotal accounts from wildland firefighters in New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, California and Wyoming. According to a recent survey by Forest Service fire managers in California, 26% of engine captain positions and 42% of engineer positions were vacant. A veteran Forest Service firefighter in California characterized the Trump administration’s current estimate of the size of its firefighting workforce as “grossly inaccurate.”
Last week, Tom Schultz, the chief of the Forest Service, circulated a letter to high-ranking officials in the agency that underscored the dire moment. “As expected, the 2025 Fire Year is proving to be extremely challenging,” wrote Schultz in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by ProPublica. “We know the demand for resources outpaces their availability.” Schultz at once directed staff to employ full suppression — stomping out fires as quickly as possible, instead of letting them burn for the sake of landscape management — and acknowledged that the resources necessary to pursue such an aggressive strategy were lacking. All options were on the table, he wrote, including directing human-resources employees to fight fires and asking recently departed employees with firefighting qualifications to return to work.
When asked about the discrepancy between Schultz’s memo and Rollins’ public statements on firefighting staffing at the Forest Service, an agency spokesperson said that Schultz was referring to employees who can be called on to bolster the agency’s response “as fire activity increases,” while Rollins was pointing only to full-time firefighters. “The Forest Service remains fully equipped and operationally ready to protect people and communities from wildfire,” the spokesperson said, noting that “many individuals that have separated from the Agency either through retirements or voluntary resignations still possess active wildland fire qualifications and are making themselves available to support fire response operations.”
The federal government employs thousands of wildland firefighters, but the precise number is opaque. Throughout the Department of the Interior, which is overseen by Secretary Doug Burgum, there are about 5,800 wildland firefighters in four agencies that have been impacted by cuts. An employee at a national park in Colorado that is threatened by wildfire said that they were “severely understaffed during the Biden administration on most fronts, and now it’s so much worse than it’s ever been.”
But the Forest Service is by far the largest employer of wildland firefighters, and it has long used gymnastic arithmetic to paint an optimistic picture of its staffing. Last summer, ProPublica reported that the Forest Service under President Joe Biden had overstated its capacity. Robert Kuhn, a former Forest Service official who between 2009 and 2011 co-authored an assessment of the agency’s personnel needs, recently said that the practice of selectively counting firefighters dates back years. “What the public needs to understand is, that is just a very small number of what is needed every summer,” he said. Riva Duncan, a retired Forest Service fire chief and the vice president of Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, a labor advocacy organization, said staffing is a constant frustration for managers on the ground. “We have engines that are completely unstaffed,” said Duncan, who remains active in wildland firefighting, having worked in temporary roles this summer. “We have vacant positions in management.”
That said, there is a difference this fire season from years past. Officials in the previous administration publicly acknowledged the danger presented by an exodus of experienced wildland firefighters. The Trump administration has taken a different approach — claiming to have solved the problem while simultaneously exacerbating it. When asked about the staffing cuts, Anna Kelly, a White House deputy press secretary, wrote, “President Trump is proud of all Secretary Rollins has accomplished to improve forest management, including by ending the 2001 Roadless Rule for stronger fire prevention, and Secretary Burgum’s great work protecting our nation’s treasured public lands.”
In March, Congress finally codified a permanent raise for federal wildland firefighters via the appropriations process, a change that advocates have sought for years. In her remarks in June, Rollins credited the president: “Out of gratitude for the selfless service of our Forest Service firefighters, President Trump permanently increased the pay for our federal wildland firefighters.”
But in February, the Trump administration laid off about 700 employees who support wildland fire operations, from human-resource managers to ecologists and trail-crew workers. Those employees possess what are known as red cards — certifications that allow them to work on fire crews. Many were subsequently rehired, but the administration then pushed Forest Service employees to accept deferred resignations and early retirements.
Last month, President Donald Trump issued an executive order directing the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior to combine their firefighting forces. For the moment, it’s unknown what form that restructuring will take, but many Forest Service firefighters are anticipating further staffing cuts. A spokesperson for the Department of the Interior wrote, “We are taking steps to unify federal wildfire programs to streamline bureaucracy.”
Administration officials have maintained that employees primarily assigned to wildland fire were exempted from the resignation offers this spring. But according to another internal data set obtained by ProPublica, of the more than 4,000 Forest Service employees who accepted deferred resignations and early retirements, approximately 1,600 had red cards. (A spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture wrote that the actual number was 1,400, adding that 85 of them “have decided to return for the season.”)
Even those figures don’t account for all the lost institutional knowledge. The departures included meteorologists who provided long-range forecasts, allowing fire managers to decide where to deploy crews. One of the meteorologists who left was Charles Maxwell, who had for more than 20 years interpreted weather models predicting summer monsoons at the Southwest Coordination Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, an interagency office. The thunderstorms can fuel wildfire, with lightning and wind, and extinguish them, with great rains. Lately, according to Maxwell, the monsoons have become less and less reliable, and understanding their nuances can be challenging. Maxwell said that he’d already been planning to retire next year. But he also said he “was concerned with the degree of chaos, the potential degradation of services and what would happen to my job.”
Maxwell noted that his work had been covered by knowledgeable fill-ins from out of state. But another firefighter who worked on blazes in New Mexico said that Maxwell’s understanding of the monsoon had been missed. A spokesperson for the Department of the Interior, which oversees the interagency office where Maxwell worked, wrote, “We do not comment on personnel matters.”
The monsoon season is now here and has brought deadly flash flooding along old burn scars in Ruidoso, New Mexico, while distributing sporadic rain in the state’s Gila National Forest.
It is shaping up to be a severe fire season. On Monday, federal firefighters reported 86 new fires across the West; by Tuesday, there were 105 more. And there’s already been some criticism of the federal response. Arizona’s governor and members of Congress have called for an investigation into the Park Service’s handling of a blaze this month that leveled a historic lodge on the Grand Canyon’s North Rim. Last month, Rollins acknowledged, “Fires don’t know Republican or Democrat, or which side of the aisle you are on.” This much, at least, is true.

Homicides and several other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, dropped during the first half of 2025 across 42 U.S. cities, continuing a downward trend that began in 2022, according to a new crime trends report released Thursday by the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
Homicides fell 17% in the first half of 2025, compared with the same period in 2024, among the 30 cities that reported homicide data, according to the report.
During that same period, five cities saw increases in homicide — ranging from 6% in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to 39% in Little Rock, Arkansas.
While the report’s authors say the continued drop in violent crime — especially homicides — is encouraging, they note that much of the decline stems from a few major cities with historically high rates, such as Baltimore and St. Louis.
More than half of the cities studied have higher homicide rates than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, though, the analysis found that there were 14% fewer homicides during the first half of 2025 compared to the same period in 2019.
The authors say more research is needed before crediting any specific policy or practice for the continued drop in violent crime.
The group’s findings come as President Donald Trump continues to amplify concerns about crime, at times citing misleading statistics and narratives.
In a Truth Social post earlier this week, Trump claimed that cashless bail — a practice that allows people charged with a crime to be released pretrial without paying money, unless a judge deems them a threat to public safety — were fueling a national crime surge and endangering law enforcement.
He wrote: “Crime in American Cities started to significantly rise when they went to CASHLESS BAIL. The WORST criminals are flooding our streets and endangering even our great law enforcement officers. It is a complete disaster, and must be ended, IMMEDIATELY!”
Some research suggests that setting money bail isn’t effective in ensuring court appearances or improving public safety. Opponents of ending cash bail often raise concerns that released suspects might commit new, potentially more serious crimes. While that is possible in individual cases, studies show that eliminating cash bail does not lead to a widespread increase in crime.
The Truth Social post also marked a sharp shift from Trump’s remarks during a June roundtable with the Fraternal Order of Police, where he claimed the national murder rate had “plummeted by 28%” since he took office — a figure that overstates the decline and overlooks the fact that murder rates began falling well before he returned to office.
According to data consulting firm AH Datalytics, which manages the Real-Time Crime Index — a free tool that collects crime data from more than 400 law enforcement agencies nationwide — the number of homicides between January and May 2025 was 20.3% lower than the same period in 2024.
Similarly, data released in May by the Major Cities Chiefs Association showed that homicides fell roughly 20% in the first quarter of 2025 compared with the first three months of the prior year. The group’s data is based on a survey of 68 major metropolitan police departments nationwide.
Researchers at the Council on Criminal Justice note in their report that it’s difficult to pinpoint a single reason for the drop in homicides, but they note that fewer people appear to be exposed to high-risk situations, such as robberies.
Most major crimes fell in the first half of 2025 compared with the same period last year, according to the council’s report.
Motor vehicle thefts dropped by 25%, while reported gun assaults fell 21%. Robberies, residential and non-residential burglaries, shoplifting, and aggravated and sexual assaults also saw double-digit declines
Drug offenses held steady, while domestic violence reports rose slightly — by about 3%. Carjackings declined 24% and larcenies were down 5%.
Compared with the first half of 2019, before the pandemic and nationwide reckoning over racial justice and policing, overall homicides are down 14%, robberies by 30%, and sexual assaults by 28%.
Still, more than 60% of the cities in the council’s study sample report homicide rates that remain above 2019 levels.
Motor vehicle theft remains the only crime tracked in the report that is still elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels — up 25% since 2019 — although it has declined sharply since 2023.
The council also released another analysis on the lethality of violent crime, showing that while violent incidents have decreased, the share of violence that ends in death has increased significantly. In 1994, there were 2 homicides per 1,000 assaults and about 16 per 1,000 robberies. By 2020, those figures rose to 7.2 and 55.8, respectively.

Read this story in English.
Dos nuevas variantes de COVID-19 se están propagando por EE. UU., y los médicos de Connecticut esperan un aumento de casos en las próximas semanas.
La NB.1.8.1, también conocida como Nimbus, se ha convertido en la variante dominante en todo el país y las autoridades sanitarias afirman que, si bien los esfuerzos de secuenciación han disminuido, parece ser un factor determinante de los nuevos casos en Connecticut.
Otra variante, la XFG o Stratus, fue catalogada recientemente como “variante bajo vigilancia” por la Organización Mundial de la Salud y se citó como la tercera más común en EE. UU. a finales de junio, según las estimaciones Nowcast (Pronósticos inmediatos) de los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades. La variante LP.8.1, prevalente durante el invierno, se mantuvo como la segunda más común.
Algunos médicos de hospitales de Connecticut han informado haber atendido a más pacientes con COVID en las últimas semanas.
“Hemos observado un aumento en el número de pacientes con COVID. Están siendo tratados con los medicamentos adecuados”, afirmó el Dr. Husnain Kermalli, director médico del Hospital Saint Mary’s de Waterbury. “Afortunadamente, sus hospitalizaciones no han sido muy complicadas. Los hemos manejado eficazmente y los hemos reintegrado a la comunidad”.
Los casos de COVID han ido en aumento en zonas del sur y de la costa oeste, así como en algunos estados del medio oeste y noreste. Connecticut aún no ha experimentado un repunte estival de infecciones, pero las autoridades sanitarias advierten que los casos podrían aumentar en las próximas semanas.
“Hemos visto olas de verano casi todos los años, así que no creo que sea inesperado que los casos de COVID comiencen a aumentar”, declaró la Dra. Lynn Sosa, directora de enfermedades infecciosas del Departamento de Salud Pública del Estado.
Esto es lo que debe saber sobre las nuevas variantes:
Las variantes más recientes parecen ser más transmisibles.
La variante Nimbus se detectó por primera vez en EE. UU. a principios de la primavera, y la variante Stratus comenzó a cobrar impulso poco después.
Ambas parecen ser más transmisibles que las variantes anteriores, pero no hay evidencia que sugiera que sean más graves, según las autoridades sanitarias.
“A medida que el virus evoluciona, lo principal es que la última versión se transmite con mayor facilidad”, explicó Sosa. “Lo que le permitirá sobrevivir y mantenerse es su mayor facilidad de propagación. De lo contrario, no podrá competir con otras cepas”.
“Si alguna variante se propaga con mayor facilidad que la anterior, es probable que Stratus se imponga con el tiempo”.
El Dr. Ulysses Wu, epidemiólogo jefe y director del sistema de enfermedades infecciosas de Hartford HealthCare, afirmó que las variantes más recientes no son más graves que las anteriores.
“Es prácticamente igual”, afirmó, y añadió: “El riesgo de padecer COVID persistente seguirá siendo el mismo”.
El dolor de garganta y la ronquera se reportan como síntomas claves.
La variante Nimbus se ha ganado el apodo de “garganta de cuchilla de afeitar” en los medios nacionales, después de que varias personas señalaran el dolor de garganta intenso como un síntoma clave de la variante.
Algunos profesionales médicos afirman que la ronquera parece ser un síntoma pronunciado en el caso de Stratus.
“Los síntomas son, según se ha descrito en redes sociales, una sensación de cuchilla de afeitar, un dolor de garganta bastante intenso, junto con algunos síntomas gastrointestinales como náuseas y quizás vómitos. Probablemente sean signos reveladores de la presencia de este tipo de variante en el organismo”, dijo Kermalli sobre Nimbus.
Sin embargo, la mayoría de los síntomas de las dos variantes más recientes son generalmente consistentes con cepas anteriores, según las autoridades sanitarias.
“No son muy diferentes”, dijo Wu. “En el caso de Nimbus, se le llama ‘garganta de cuchilla de afeitar’, pero el dolor de garganta siempre ha ocurrido con el COVID. En el caso de Stratus, el síntoma es una voz áspera, o lo que me gusta llamar… ‘voz de fumador’, que probablemente sea un síntoma nuevo, pero en realidad no significa nada diferente”.
Tos, fiebre, dificultad para respirar, fatiga, dolor de cabeza y dolor corporal siguen siendo síntomas comunes del COVID.
Los médicos instan a las personas a quedarse en casa si están enfermas.
Los profesionales médicos recomiendan quedarse en casa si se siente enfermo. Hay kits de prueba disponibles para el hogar.
Según la Organización Mundial de la Salud, se espera que las vacunas contra la COVID-19 sigan siendo eficaces contra la enfermedad sintomática y grave como Stratus y Nimbus. Las autoridades sanitarias sugirieron mantenerse al día con la vacunación.
“Para el público, les diría que tomen las mismas precauciones”, dijo Wu. “Su protección sigue siendo la misma. Deben seguir vacunándose. Deben seguir usando mascarilla,… Si tienen una alta sospecha [de enfermedad], deben hacerse varias pruebas y, como mínimo, usar mascarilla para prevenir la transmisión”.
“Si están enfermos, deben quedarse en casa, porque estas variantes son muy transmisibles. Esa es la mejor manera de proteger la salud de los demás”, agregó Sosa. “Queremos que las personas se cubran la boca al toser si tienen que salir. Queremos que se laven las manos. Todas las medidas que normalmente tomaríamos son las mismas que debemos seguir haciendo con estas variantes”.
El tiempo de recuperación y el tratamiento son los mismos.
La recuperación del COVID varía de persona a persona, pero los tiempos de recuperación con las variantes más recientes son generalmente los mismos que con las versiones anteriores, según las autoridades sanitarias.
“Digamos que el día cero es el inicio de los síntomas. Probablemente, entre el séptimo y el décimo día, empezarán a sentirse mejor”, dijo Kermalli. “Para algunas personas, será entre el cuarto y el quinto día; para otras, podría durar hasta el día 15. Si los síntomas han durado más tiempo, probablemente les llevará un poco más de tiempo recuperarse por completo”.
Los tratamientos también son similares.
“Las personas que se enferman, especialmente si son mayores o tienen afecciones médicas subyacentes, deben consultar con su médico sobre el tratamiento”, dijo Sosa. “Todavía hay tratamientos disponibles para el COVID, específicamente Paxlovid”.

[Photo/Courtesy]Nine environmental advocacy groups on Thursday redoubled their opposition to federal efforts extending the life of a West Michigan coal plant originally slated to close earlier this year.
Although the J.H. Campbell coal plant, owned by Consumers Energy, was set to go dark on May 31, the U.S. Department of Energy issued an order on May 23 forcing the plant to remain open past its expiration date.
Despite agreements between Consumers, state energy regulators, the Department of Attorney General and multiple parties representing customer and environmental interests to close the plant down, the Department of Energy justified the move by arguing it was under the authority of the Federal Power Act, and fell in line with President Donald Trump’s executive order declaring a national energy emergency. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
On June 18, the environmental law group Earthjustice filed a challenge on behalf of 10 public interest groups requesting a rehearing on the department’s order. 
In their request, the groups highlighted the negative environmental impacts of the plant while rejecting the Trump administration’s argument that the plant is needed to prevent disruptions to the state’s energy grid. State energy regulators have also ensured that the plant’s retirement would not impact grid reliability.
However, the order went unanswered, prompting nine of those groups to file a petition for review with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, with Earthjustice and the Sierra Club leading the charge. 
Derrell Slaughter, Michigan policy director of climate and energy for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said people in Michigan and the Midwest should not be stuck paying the cost of a nonexistent emergency with their health and electric bills.
“The Campbell coal plant is out of date, costs more to operate than other electricity generation options, and is one of the worst polluters in the state,” Slaughter said. “This petition is very much in line with the State of Michigan’s commitment to pursue a clean, affordable, and reliable grid that protects both ratepayers and public health.”
In an interview with CNN, Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission, which oversees the state’s energy utilities, estimated that the cost for keeping the plant open could cost tens of millions of dollars on the low end.
The Natural Resources Defense Council also noted that the plant releases several millions of pounds of health-harming pollution and more than 10 billion pounds of climate-harming carbon dioxide into the air each year. That’s in addition to releasing roughly 100,000 pounds of water pollution into Lake Michigan every year, including 10,000 pounds of toxic metals.
Shannon Fisk, an attorney and director of state electric sector advocacy for Earthjustice, emphasized that the utility, alongside state regulators and stakeholders, all agreed the plant should be retired. 
“While the administration might not like that fact, a fabricated energy emergency does not give them the authority to saddle Michiganders with the costs and pollution of a coal plant that the utility has already replaced with other resources,” Fisk said. “The only energy emergency is the one being created by this unprecedented power grab by federal authorities.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-24-065259.png,,,2025-07-25 12:56:51.441736

Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images. U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer, a Republican who represents Minnesota’s 6th District, singled out Somali Minnesotans in a Fox News segment, prompting a response from Somali advocates. 
“These Somali gangs are incredibly dangerous,” Emmer said. “And yet no one in the Minnesota media is reporting that that’s what’s going on. We’ve got Somali gangs that are causing these problems. Good news is I visited with our FBI last week and they’re taking action. But it’s been a long time coming.” 
Emmer, who is the current House majority whip, was being interviewed about the Minneapolis mayoral race on the Fox News show “The Bottom Line.” Somali-American state Sen. Omar Fateh, who was born in the United States, was endorsed for mayor by city DFL delegates Saturday. 
Fartun Weli, the CEO of Isuroon, a Somali-American women’s organization, released a statement Thursday in response to Emmer’s comments. 
“Somali-American families are working hard to prevent and intervene in youth violence, and we won’t let baseless accusations undermine our efforts. Emmer’s race-based language only serves to deepen the racial divide,” Weli said. “By calling Somali-Americans — even those born here — just ‘Somalis,’ Emmer pushes a racially charged narrative that erases their American identity.” 
Data show that insofar as Emmer is concerned about crime in Minnesota, he should focus at least as much on American-born citizens as immigrants: A 2023 paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research indicates that “as a group, immigrants have had lower incarceration rates than the US-born for 150 years. Moreover, relative to the US-born, immigrants’ incarceration rates have declined since 1960: immigrants today are 60% less likely to be incarcerated.”
Last year, Emmer called for Rep. Ilhan Omar to resign over an incorrect translation of Omar’s comments about the strife between Somalia and a breakaway region called Somaliland. “Ilhan Omar’s appalling, Somalia-first comments are a slap in the face to the Minnesotans she was elected to serve and a direct violation of her oath of office,” Emmer wrote on X. When the Reformer published a story correcting the faulty translation, Emmer didn’t respond to inquiries. 
Although Emmer’s Fox News comments are not out of character with his more recent statements, there was a time when he defended Somali-Americans from attacks by local anti-Somali activists. 
A decade ago, Emmer created a Congressional Somalia Caucus with then-U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison. When people in St. Cloud called for a moratorium on Somali immigrants, he pushed back, calling the proposed ban “un-American.”
“If you’re asking me how I feel about immigrant populations who are in this country legally, and who are actually trying to find a better way for themselves and their families, I support it wholeheartedly,” he said at a town hall in 2015.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)States must begin verifying millions of Medicaid enrollees’ monthly work status by the end of next year — a task some critics say states will have a hard time carrying out.
A provision in the tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law July 4 will require the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are volunteering or working at least 80 hours a month or attending school at least half time.
The new law provides states $200 million for fiscal year 2026 to get their systems up and running. But some experts say states will have difficulty meeting the deadline with that funding and worry enrollees might lose their health benefits as a result.
A year and a half to comply is likely not going to be enough time for most states, especially since the federal government must craft guidance on how they should implement their programs, said Dr. Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He predicted it will be difficult to create technology simple enough — such as a phone app — to streamline the process for all enrollees.
“Two hundred million [dollars] is not going to cover the 40 expansion states that we have,” he told Stateline. “There is not a silver bullet here, and there isn’t a single app out there that’s going to keep people who should be in Medicaid from losing coverage. That’s just not realistic.”
Fedorchak emphasizes need for new Medicaid requirements

A spokesperson for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Hannah Jones, told Stateline that “it will take a significant amount of time and investment in order to implement work requirements.”
Jones said an estimated 255,000 people in North Carolina could lose coverage because of these requirements and their “administrative burden.”
“More automation reduces manual work on beneficiaries and eligibility case workers, but it requires more time, funding, and staff resources to implement,” Jones wrote in an email.
Emma Herrock, a spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Health, wrote in an email that the vast majority of the state’s Medicaid enrollees already work, and the agency expects few people to be disenrolled. Herrock said the department will establish work verification systems by the end of 2026.
“The department is taking a thoughtful approach to implementation,” Herrock wrote. “We are already working with several Louisiana agencies … in order to receive data on recipients who are working.”
She added that the department views work requirements “as a means to grow our economy, while reinforcing the value of work and self-sufficiency.”
In New York, it could cost the state $500 million to administer the new requirements, New York Department of Health spokesperson Danielle De Souza wrote in an email.
Between 600,000 and 1.1 million individuals who are eligible for and enrolled in Medicaid could potentially lose coverage because of work reporting requirements, she wrote, based on what happened when states were required to resume checking eligibility after the COVID-19 health emergency ended.
“The department will remain steadfast in its commitment to protecting the health of all New Yorkers and will work to mitigate the impacts of this law,” De Souza wrote.
Hoeven backs big bill as benefiting North Dakotans

The new rules apply to states that expanded Medicaid to adults between the ages of 19 and 64 with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty line (about $22,000 for an individual), an option that was made available under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. More than 20 million people were enrolled through Medicaid expansion as of June 2024 — those are the patients who will face work requirements.
Reapplying for Medicaid, which typically has been required once a year, already is burdensome for some patients, said Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, president of the American Medical Association.
“On top of that, now we’re going to be challenging so many people who were at least able to deal with it financially with things like … proving that they got a job,” Mukkamala said in an interview.
Previous attempts at implementing work requirements have ended up costing states millions in administrative and consulting fees. And in some cases, people who were eligible for Medicaid lost their coverage due to paperwork issues.
Arkansas’ example
Several states wanted to implement work requirements during the first Trump administration. But only Arkansas fully did so, in 2018, before a federal judge halted the requirements. More than 18,000 Arkansas residents lost Medicaid coverage during the 10 months the requirements were in effect.
Sommers, of Harvard, noted that most people were disenrolled because they didn’t know about the policy or made paperwork errors, not because they weren’t working.
“Red tape led to people losing their coverage,” he said. “They had more trouble affording their medications. They were putting off needed care.”
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that advises congressional Republicans, said he thinks concerns about the new requirements are overblown because there’s more advanced technology now.
“Lots of government programs have initial implementation challenges,” Blase told Stateline. “Arkansas was seven years ago, and if you just think about the change in the technological advancements over the past seven years … we didn’t have artificial intelligence and just the ability of modern tech.”
Federal funding cuts to North Dakota agencies total $100M so far, analysis shows

As it stands, each state has varying technological capabilities, and will have a different timeline and budget, said Michael Heifetz, a managing director at consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal and a former Medicaid director in Wisconsin. His team contracts with states to implement Medicaid, including work requirements, and other programs.
He also noted that the Trump administration can give states a deadline extension on implementing work requirements to Dec. 31, 2028, if they show they are making a “good faith effort.” States will need to share data across agencies in new ways, he said.
“It will require some form of data sharing and communications with educational agencies, workforce training agencies and some other agencies that typically aren’t in the Medicaid ecosystem,” Heifetz said.
State governments may resist hiring full-time positions for those tasks, he said, but “artificial intelligence and other tools can help work through these processes in a smoother fashion.”
Other state efforts
Efforts in other states to implement work requirements have had mixed results.
In Georgia, for example, an experimental work requirement program cost taxpayers more than $86 million in its first 18 months but enrolled just 6,500 people during that time, according to an investigation by ProPublica and The Current published in February. That’s 75% fewer participants than the state had estimated for the program’s first year.
The nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office in 2019 looked at five states that tested systems to track Medicaid work requirements under the first Trump administration. Those demonstration projects were rescinded during the Biden administration.
The states estimated their projected administrative costs for implementing work requirements for one to three years, and the total far surpassed the $200 million Congress has provided in the new law. Kentucky alone estimated $270 million, Wisconsin $70 million, Indiana $35 million, Arkansas $26 million and New Hampshire $6 million.
Susan Barnidge, an assistant director on the GAO health care team and an author of the report, said the agency found that across states there wasn’t much federal oversight of administrative costs on test programs. Oversight will be key as states roll out their work requirement systems, she said.
“We found some weaknesses in [federal] Centers for Medicare & Medicaid oversight of certain federal funding for certain administrative activities. So we found examples of things that states sought federal funding for that didn’t appear to be allowable,” Barnidge said in an interview. “I think that will remain relevant.”
Mukkamala, of the American Medical Association, said the burden will in some ways fall to doctors’ offices to help keep patients enrolled, as they work with patients to check eligibility and possibly help get them on Medicaid. He works in Flint, Michigan, as an otolaryngologist, or ear, nose and throat doctor, and said a third of his patients are on Medicaid.
“As if it’s easy to take care of their health care issue, given things like prior authorization,” Mukkamala told Stateline. “Now to add to the challenge, we have to figure out how to get them covered.”

Doña Ana County Commissioners unanimously declared a disaster and are seeking state aid in digging out and making repairs. (Courtesy of Mesilla Valley Search and Rescue)The Doña Ana Board of County Commissioners voted unanimously Thursday evening to request state disaster assistance after recent heavy rains caused flash flooding in Vado and Del Cerro.
The resolution requests Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham declare a state of emergency and establishes a Disaster Housing Program to fund grant requests for people impacted by flooding. The county created the program with $500,000 from its hospital lease fund.
“No other county or municipality has ever done this,” Chair Christopher Schaljo-Hernandez said. “This is the first time anyone has ever offered emergency funding for homeowners to find emergency housing.”
According to the resolution, the fund will support indigent renters and homeowners who lost their primary residents due to flooding proved by a damage assessment and photo documentation. Homeowners with a total loss of home can receive $9,000 grants for the purpose of obtaining safe housing, while renters will be eligible for a$3,000 grant for obtaining a new place to rent. If the loss is only temporary, homeowners and renters will receive emergency housing grants of $1,500.
Lt. Governor Howie Morales appeared at the meeting in person and commended the commissioners for their quick action. He said he supported the disaster declaration.
Morales said the state has already requested an assessment team from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to deploy to Doña Ana, to see if the damage meets the threshold for federal assistance.
“Right now we have floods that are taking place in Ruidoso again, we have flood warnings around San Miguel,” Morales said. “By adding Doña Ana County to that national disaster declaration, frees up flexibility as well…for some assistance we’re not able to do at the local or state level.”
Damage from severe and repeated flooding in the burn scars around Ruidoso in the Sacramento mountains to the east continued Thursday, as the river rose above 12 feet and swept away a home. Floods on July 9 killed three people, destroyed hundreds of homes and necessitated the rescue of dozens.
President Donald Trump recently approved additional federal funds for Lincoln County, but state officials said they’re pushing for the federal government to grant outstanding requests for flooding damages in Chaves, Otero and Valencia counties.

Flood Commissioner John Gwynne presented a drone survey of Vado, showing much of the water remains in the days since Tuesday night’s flooding as many of the channels for draining the water remain plugged with debris and sediment.
“At the earliest, it’ll be next week before we can actually start moving sediment, and that’s if it’s dry enough,” Gwynne said.
Stephen Lopez, the assistant county manager, said local wastewater pumps have removed about 3.3 million gallons of water but are under strain from moving that much water. Without further repair of canals and roads, the county cannot add more pumps, since there’d be nowhere for the water to go.
Commissioner Susana Chaparro asked if there’s continuing threats from sewage backing up into the standing floodwaters.
“The water is absolutely contaminated,” Lopez said. “Not just with human excrement, but also with a lot of runoff from animals.”

(Photo by Alon Skuy/Getty Images)Deportation flights have started at the state-run immigrant detention center in the Everglades more than three weeks after the first detainees arrived, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Friday.
The federal government has deported 100 people held at the notorious site in an old airstrip and flown out hundreds more to other hubs, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s staging facility in Louisiana, DeSantis said during the on-site press conference.
“You’re going to see the cadence on these flights start to pick up, obviously,” he said. “Honestly, to get to where we were the beginning of this month, and now have flights leaving already with a facility that’s been built out, that’s incredible.”
Two dozen people chose to self-deport from the detention center at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, the governor said.
An ICE spokesperson refused to answer questions about the deportation flights, directing Florida Phoenix to the Florida Division of Emergency Management. That state agency is in charge of the state-run detention center, but the federal government operates deportations.
ICE arrests of immigrants without criminal convictions or charges surge in Florida

The governor also continued defending the state’s operation of the detention center, dismissing detainee accounts about rotting food, denial of medical care, scarce access to showers, and malfunctioning toilets. Immigrants at the detention center in the Everglades are also demanding access to their attorneys in a class action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, ICE, DeSantis, and the head of DEM.
DEM director Kevin Guthrie grew increasingly agitated while defending the conditions at the detention center.
“So again, simple answer: Absolute crap,” he said. “We have on this facility, the ability of a full-fledged medical center with X-ray capability, sonogram capability, prescription med capability.”
The emergency head also scoffed at questions about the bidding process for the hundreds of millions in contracts for the detention center the state removed from a public database. Guthrie said the line item details of the contracts were removed so other competitors couldn’t see the rate the state paid.
“You got me riled back up again. Sorry about that,” he said.
Orlando Democratic Rep. Anna Eskamani has been one of the most ardent critics of the $245 million AP has reported the state has spent on the detention center. She has pointed out the deletion of the contracts from the state’s database on X.
“This entire press conference at the Everglades Immigrant Detention Camp is all about damage control,” she wrote on X. “We have an administration that is actively hiding contracts, information, and detainees from the public. Hundreds who are NOT criminals. And doing it all on the public’s dime.”
Eskamani is one of five Democrats in the state Legislature suing the DeSantis administration to gain oversight access to the detention center.
Although the press conference was at the detention center, press were not allowed inside. DeSantis sustained the decision, saying journalists had toured when President Donald Trump visited on July 1.
“Here’s the thing. This is not a spectacle. Okay?” DeSantis said. “You don’t get to go into other facilities willy nilly either.”

According to a recent analysis by FWD.us, a bipartisan immigration advocacy group, the rollback of humanitarian parole programs and other immigration policies could sharply reduce the workforce in several U.S. industries that rely on immigrant labor.
Under the Biden administration, immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela — four countries grappling with ongoing humanitarian crises — were allowed to enter the U.S. temporarily under a humanitarian parole system that required a background check and financial sponsor.
But earlier this year, the Trump administration ended these programs. The Supreme Court upheld the move. As a result, hundreds of thousands of immigrants lost their legal right to work and are now considered undocumented.
FWD.us estimates that around 740,000 workers from those countries and others had been employed under humanitarian parole. Of those, at least 30,000 worked on farms, and another 90,000 held jobs in manufacturing — including meatpacking and food processing plants.
The potential labor shortfall in these essential industries could ripple through the economy.
Using a model developed by Francesc Ortega, a professor of economics at the City University of New York, FWD.us projects that the current administration’s recent and proposed immigration policies could drive a 14.5% increase in prices for food, beverages and tobacco products between 2024 and 2028 — on top of existing inflation.
“We used economic modeling to estimate the impact that some of President Trump’s immigration policies would have on prices for the average American household,” said Phillip Connor, senior demographer at FWD.us. “When large parts of the workforce are removed, the demand for goods and services stays the same, but there are fewer workers to produce them. That imbalance is what drives prices up.”
Some employers have already begun layoffs. In recent months, companies like Walmart and JBS began terminating workers who lost their work authorizations following the Supreme Court decision.
The ruling comes amid a contradictory and evolving set of signals from the Trump administration regarding immigrant labor in the agricultural sector.
This month, Trump floated the idea of granting temporary permits for undocumented workers on farms and in meatpacking plants. Yet, in recent months, there have been multiple reports of ICE raids on farms, and a meatpacking plant in Omaha was also targeted.

“It really has been a true lifeline for the entire family,” Young said in a press call Thursday. “We have tried to provide care for my sister, and her needs are so demanding, so extreme, that a family by itself can’t manage to make this work. We need help, we need support, we’ve thrown ourselves into this to the extent that we can, but many, many other families are in similar situations.”
Young said that when Medicaid cuts hit Colorado in the past, the state could no longer provide residential care for his sister. She went through 20 different residential facilities in a span of 18 months, all of which were “inadequate” because they did not have proper funding, he said.
“Often, she was ejected from a placement because she overwhelmed the providers, sometimes without even a phone call,” Young said.



Young and financial officials from four other Democratic-led states participated in a call hosted by Americans for Responsible Growth, a national advocacy group that works with state financial leaders. They warned about how Republicans’ recent policy law, called by President Donald Trump the “big, beautiful bill,” will negatively affect Medicaid and Medicare recipients ahead of the 60th anniversary of the programs.
The law cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, a state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes.
Dave Wallack, executive director of Americans for Responsible Growth, said that since the Trump administration took office, Republicans have “systematically gutted health care programs, fired thousands of federal workers, and slashed more than a trillion dollars for Medicaid, the largest cut in the program’s history.”
Wallack said the cuts will lead to 17 million Americans losing health care coverage and more than 50,000 preventable deaths annually. Young said in Colorado, more than 375,000 recipients could lose Medicaid coverage. Democratic officials from New Mexico, Illinois, Minnesota and Maryland all said that rural communities in their states will be hit hardest by the cuts, and they will feel the effects first.
Rural hospitals at risk
Laura Montoya, the New Mexico state treasurer, said her state is the No. 1 recipient state for Medicaid in the nation, and 80% of the babies born in New Mexico are born into Medicaid. She said the federal law’s changes to Medicaid will “force hospitals and clinics to either raise premiums or copays or shut down entirely,” and 15 hospitals in rural communities are already at risk of closing their doors.
“Our state’s entire provider network depends on the state’s current Medicaid coverage landscape,” Montoya said. “These cuts will increase health care costs for all New Mexicans regardless of Medicaid enrollment, not to mention more uninsured individuals could end up skipping preventative care leading to worsened health outcomes, higher cost for emergency care, and more crowded emergency rooms and urgent care facilities, placing even more strain on an already overwhelmed system.”
The shift of responsibility for states to fund Medicaid could also destabilize New Mexico’s entire support network, including housing assistance, early childhood education, public safety and economic development, Montoya said. The New Mexico Legislature passed a measure creating a Medicaid trust fund to safeguard services amid federal cuts, she added.
Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs said 44% of the Medicaid recipients in his state are children, 9% are seniors, and 7% are adults with disabilities. Nine rural hospitals in Illinois, all in Republican districts, are at risk of closing because of funding cuts, he said.
“When hospitals close and health care providers cut back, people lose their jobs. They lose their income, and their health insurance,” Frerichs said. “Illinois’ economy will be destabilized. The cruel, inhumane Trump big bad budget bill will wreak havoc across Illinois for years to come.”
Julie Blaha, Minnesota’s state auditor, said about 25% of Minnesotans are enrolled in the state’s Medicaid program, which also supports 30% of births. For Black and Indigenous communities, those numbers are even higher: The state’s medical assistance program covers 80% of Black babies born in the state and 90% of Indigenous babies.
Blaha said it is more cost-efficient to keep people on these health care programs in a stable place, as it’s more expensive “to pull somebody up who’s fallen through.”
“It is time to stand up and tell Congress and tell Trump to roll back these terrible cuts and try to stop the avalanche before it crushes us all,” Blaha said.
Brooke Lierman, the Maryland state comptroller, said 42% of her state’s population is supported by Medicaid or Medicare. She said the two programs were designed to take care of “vulnerable Americans” who would be “sicker and worse off” without the coverage they provide.
“These programs are economic powerhouses that drive prosperity in our communities and strengthen our state’s fiscal foundation,” Lierman said. “Cutting Medicaid is both fiscally reckless and morally bankrupt, abandoning our most vulnerable residents, including our seniors and people with disabilities, while destroying the economic foundation that so many of our communities depend on.”
‘Among the greatest policy achievements’
Health care is a “major economic driver” in Colorado, Young said, as hospitals employ about 1 in 5 Colorado residents and generate $1 billion in tax revenue yearly. Reduced federal investment in health care will lead to clinic closures and reduced tax revenue that will affect quality of life for “Coloradans of every age and income bracket,” he said.
“Colorado cannot afford to downsize our health care sector,” Young said. “We’re already facing dire workforce and health care shortages, especially in rural and frontier communities. The state can’t make up for these losses either.”
Medicaid and Medicare are “among the greatest policy achievements in American history,” Young said, as the programs strengthen health care systems and lift people out of poverty. He said the programs can be strengthened while saving money, but “this slash and burn technique” will be “devastating.”
“When people get the care they need, they hold down jobs, they provide for their families and avoid catastrophic medical debt,” Young said.

(Photo by Ariel Skelley/Getty Photos)As the federal government and states move to cut about $1 trillion over the next decade from Medicaid, researchers estimate annual impacts by 2034 of hundreds of thousands of jobs lost and billions less in state and local tax revenue.
The research published this month in the peer-reviewed journal JAMA Health Forum looked at the long-term economic effects of the Medicaid provisions in President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending bill, which cuts the joint state-federal health insurance program for people with lower incomes or with disabilities and provides tax cuts that disproportionately benefit wealthier Americans.
By 2034, the researchers estimated annual economic impacts to reach 302 000 jobs lost and $135.3 billion in reduced economic output, leading to $11.1 billion in annual state and local tax revenue reductions.
Coverage losses could generate $7.6 billion in medical debt, triggering a further $3.8 billion reduction in economic activity, the study said.
As the single largest source of health coverage in the nation that covers 72 million people — or a fifth of the U.S. population — Medicaid is a key source of revenue to health care providers, as well as a significant funding stream for health facilities. Hospitals are major employers and drivers of local economies.
In New York, for example, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul’s office estimates that 65,000 jobs could be lost due to cuts in hospitals and community health centers, as well as a loss of $14.4 billion in hospital-related economic activity.

  U.S. Rep. Alma Adams (D-NC) (Photo: House.gov stream)
In a letter sent Thursday to House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole (R-Okla.) and Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee Chair Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.), the lawmakers urged the two Republicans to “pressure the Administration to release the funds Congress appropriated as soon as possible.”
“These funds, once redirected, cannot be recovered for student use,” the lawmakers wrote. “Even if funds are released immediately, damage has already been done.”
The funding includes more than $5 billion for K-12 schools and support for adult education programs. Without access to the money, the letter warns, school districts face “untenable” decisions and may cut support staff or taking on debt that diverts resources from instruction.
The July 24 letter follows an earlier July 10 request co-led by Adams and signed by 150 House members. The funds remain largely frozen despite weeks of pressure from lawmakers and education advocates.
Some money, however, has been released. This week, the U.S. Department of Education released $35 million funding for 21st Century Community Learning Centers, which support afterschool and summer programs, following bipartisan push for release of the funds. That money, part of a broader $165 million allotment in congressionally approved education funds for North Carolina, that was withheld by the Administration.
Attorney General Jeff Jackson and 24 other state attorneys general filed suit last week, accusing the administration of unlawfully withholding the funds.

Meanwhile, Wake County Public Schools, which is North Carolina’s largest school system, is slated to lose more than $8 million in federal funding. In a separate letter sent Wednesday to Education Secretary Linda McMahon, U.S. Reps. Deborah Ross, who represents the Raleigh area, and Valerie Foushee, who represents parts of the Triangle, warned that the delay is already disrupting hiring, stalling program planning, and harming students who rely on federally funded services. 
Wake County’s pending funding includes grants for teacher support English language acquisition, and school safety and enrichment programs Ross and Foushee called the administration’s refusal to release the money “deeply harmful” and “unlawful.” 
“These programs are not optional enhancements,” the lawmakers wrote. “They help districts recruit and retain high-quality teachers, serve students who are English learners, and provide critical services like mental health support, STEM enrichment, and school safety programs.” 
Adams, who represents Charlotte and serves as ranking member of the House Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Development, said in the letter that the funding delay is jeopardizing education for millions of students across the country. 
“We implore you to join us, just as ten of your Republican Senate colleagues have, in demanding that OMB and the Department of Education immediately release these Congressionally-approved education funds,” the letter reads. “This request comes not only from us as Members of Congress, but on behalf of millions of students, and educators.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/teacher-in-a-classroom-1536x864-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-25 10:56:14.265750

A growing number of Americans — more than 63 million, or nearly 1 in 4 — have served as a family caregiver for a loved one in the past year. The figure is a jump of 20 million Americans compared to a decade ago, according to findings released Thursday by AARP and the National Alliance for Caregiving (NAC).
The surge is due to a confluence of factors, including Americans living longer but in some instances, in poorer health. That is requiring more people to engage in the work of family caregiving. There is also a growing recognition of who is a family caregiver — or a person providing care to an adult or child with a complex medical condition or disability, often without pay.

This story was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.

The report finds that these caregivers are managing financial risks, their own poor health and isolation. As in a previous iteration of the survey, roughly 60 percent of family caregivers are women. Women, LGBTQ+ caregivers, and those who felt they had no choice in becoming caregivers are significantly more likely to report feeling alone.
“We need systems that see caregivers, value them and support them — because they are not just helping families, they are holding up our entire health care system,” said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, CEO of AARP. “This impacts all of us because most of us will be a caregiver or need one at some point in our lives. And too often, people don’t realize that they are a caregiver until they’re already overwhelmed and unsupported.”
Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences because of their growing responsibilities. They’re draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing. One in 5 report that their own health is fair or poor.
The “Caregiving in the U.S. 2025” report, which surveyed nearly 7,000 caregivers nationwide, also finds nearly 1 in 3 family caregivers are part of the “sandwich generation” of caregivers who raise children while simultaneously caring for adults in their lives.
“This dual responsibility is a recipe for burnout and requires solutions that recognize caregiving happens across the lifespan,” said Jason Resendez, CEO of NAC. “It’s time to recognize and value this continuum of care that we all experience and benefit from, and the responsibilities themselves are becoming more complex and more intensive.”
During a media call Thursday, AARP and NAC shared the story of Alma Valencia, a woman from Pasadena, California, who has cared for her mother for the past 10 years. Valencia’s mother has dementia. Valencia said she eventually left her career to become her mother’s full-time caregiver. That meant losing a stable salary and benefits, and isolation.
“Like so many others, I didn’t plan for this,” she said. “I stepped into the role because someone I love needed me.”
The report shows 65% of family caregivers now help with at least one activity of daily living, including intimate tasks like bathing, dressing and feeding. Over half say they’re performing complex medical and nursing tasks that once primarily took place in clinics and hospitals, including administering injections and managing medical equipment. But only 11 percent of family caregivers say they’ve received training for basic caregiving tasks — and just 22% get any training for complex medical and nursing tasks.
Both AARP and the National Alliance for Caregiving are calling for federal policies that include national paid family and medical leave, a federal tax credit to bring relief to out-of-pocket costs and greater access to respite care, training and support services, as well as stronger workplace protections that recognize caregiving responsibilities.
These organizations have been advocating for these policies in joint reports for years, but now they come amid a changing federal landscape. President Donald Trump this month signed a tax and budget law that is estimated to cut federal Medicaid spending by more than $900 billion over 10 years. Nearly eight million family caregivers rely on Medicaid for their own health care coverage, according to Resendez.
Resendez said advocates are seeing progress at the state level, with several establishing paid family leave policies or advancing caregiver tax credits and long-term care insurance programs.
“This is an issue that continues to build strength and visibility, and this report helps to put numbers behind the urgency for that continuing, and for translating that into solid action,” he said.

Gary Peters, endorsing Republican Mike Rogers days after it became clear that he was the lone Republican seeking the seat.
Rogers, a former congressman from White Lake, received Trump’s endorsement Thursday evening, which was published on Trump’s Truth social media network.
“From the U.S. Army to Congress, Mike has served our Nation with distinction, and will bring that same Fighting Spirit to the U.S. Senate,” Trump wrote. “As your next Senator, Mike will work tirelessly to Grow our Economy, Cut Taxes and Regulations, Promote MADE IN THE U.S.A., Unleash American Energy DOMINANCE by keeping the price of Gasoline, Oil, and all forms of Energy VERY LOW (CHEAP!), Help Secure our now VERY Secure (Record Setting!) Southern Border, Support our Incredible Military/Veterans, and Defend our always under siege Second Amendment.”
Trump previously endorsed Rogers in his 2024 bid for the U.S. Senate, which he lost to current U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly). For the 2026 contest, Trump again said Rogers had his “complete and total endorsement.”
Rogers thanked Trump in a post on X.
“We’re going to Make America – and Michigan – Great Again!” Rogers wrote. “Michigan, let’s get to work!”
If no other challenger emerges, Rogers would remain positioned as the presumptive Michigan Republican Party nominee. 
Round two for Rogers’ senatorial ambitions would see him face one of several Michigan Democrats in an already crowded U.S. Senate race. The list of Democrats includes U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), state Rep. Joe Tate (D-Detroit) and former gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed.
Meanwhile, Trump also gave a nod to Republican U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga of Holland Township, who was seriously considering jumping into the Republican U.S. Senate primary against Rogers but decided against it on Wednesday.
Although Huizenga has yet to announce whether he’ll seek reelection to his Michigan 4th Congressional District seat, Trump on his signature social media platform said he hopes Huizenga will stay in Congress.
“Congressman Bill Huizenga is a Tremendous Champion, and Highly Effective Representative, for the incredible people of Michigan’s 4th Congressional District!” Trump wrote Thursday. “Bill is doing a truly FANTASTIC job representing Southwest Michigan, and I hope he runs for Re-Election to Michigan’s 4th Congressional District — He will have my Complete and Total Endorsement, and he will never let us down!”

(Courtesy photo by Thom Campbell)A group of state lawmakers and voting rights advocates will meet three times over the next two months to prepare for the next time the Legislature redraws the state’s political maps at the end of this decade — a process known as redistricting.
Fair Districts for New Mexico, which is affiliated with the nonpartisan advocacy group League of Women Voters New Mexico, is convening the New Mexico Redistricting Task Force, which will meet Aug. 4, Aug. 19 and Sept. 10; the meetings won’t be open to the public, but will be recorded and made available, organizers told Source NM. 
Former New Mexico Court of Appeals Judges Roderick Kennedy and Linda Vanzi are leading the group, which includes state senators and representatives from both major political parties, the NAACP’s Santa Fe chapter, the Election Reformers Network and Common Cause New Mexico. 
Fair Districts for New Mexico Project Coordinator Kathleen Burke previewed some of the task force’s agenda to members of the interim legislative Indian Affairs Committee, during a recent meeting held in the Navajo Nation Pinedale Chapter House in Church Rock.
A major focus will be revisiting a push to create an independent redistricting commission and take away lawmakers’ authority in redrawing political maps and thus reduce gerrymandering, aka drawing them to benefit individual people, groups and political parties.
As an historical analysis of New Mexico’s redistricting prepared in 2021 noted, the state has rarely accomplished redistricting “without struggle, chaos, litigation and great cost to taxpayers.”
Prior efforts have been made to reduce partisanship in the process. The 2021 Redistricting Act created the seven-member Citizens Redistricting Committee, which produced a series of maps that year after holding public meetings. 
During the Indian Affairs Committee meeting, Burke called the CRC “a stepping stone” toward possibly creating an independent redistricting commission. Leonard Gorman, a redistricting technician and executive director of the Navajo Nation Human Rights Commission, also described it as a “good step in the right direction.”
Lawmakers during the last redistricting adopted and the governor ultimately approved a congressional map based on, but not entirely reflective of, the CRC’s recommendations. That map ended up in litigation, and was eventually upheld by the state Supreme Court. 
A coalition of tribal leaders also objected to the state Senate map because it protected incumbents at the expense of tribes’ preferred boundaries.
Advocates like Burke say they hope to avoid another court battle by having solid redistricting reform codified into state law before the next round of redistricting begins in 2029.
“That’s why we are continuing our efforts, that’s why we’re continuing to have a more transparent and correct process for redistricting,” Burke told the committee.
In the last legislative session, a group of lawmakers introduced a resolution that would have let voters decide whether to amend the state’s Constitution in order to create an independent redistricting commission responsible for redistricting. That proposal never received a public hearing.
Until a different redistricting process is established, lawmakers will continue to draw the maps in the way that best suits them, Burke told Source NM.
“Inevitably, when legislators are allowed to draw their own districts, it comes out they will make decisions that protect themselves, their party, their position,” she said in a recent interview. “As long as we New Mexicans allow that to be the process, then it will continue.”
Lawmakers on the Indian Affairs Committee said they’re still invested in redistricting reform.
Rep. Charlotte Little (D-Albuquerque), who was a coordinator with the NM Native Census Coalition during the previous census, said the last redistricting process at the Legislature was challenging. “It was nuts,” she told the committee.
“I got to see how those maps were actually made; it is not a pretty sight,” she said. “The wheeling and dealing that went on in there, I see why the public is mistrustful. I see why there’s an urgency and an imperative for transparency.”

On the opposite wall are displays with a working air compressor that pressurize air needed to set pistons in motion, where job candidates can demonstrate their knowledge of pneumatics.
Next week, 83 job seekers will be the first to undergo these tests to show off their mechanical troubleshooting skills as they interview for a position at the electric vehicle maker’s $2 billion Midlands assembly plant.
Construction of $2B Scout Motors electric vehicle plant underway near Columbia

By the end of the year, Scout hopes to have at least 70 experienced maintenance workers on staff. They’re the people who will set up and keep the factory’s vast array of machinery and robotics operational as the company speeds toward its goal of rolling the first Scout vehicles off the assembly line in 2027.
“This is an important next step in bringing our vision for Scout Motors to life in South Carolina,” said Meredith Manz, the company’s chief human resources officer. “We’re excited to welcome these technicians, who will represent the first wave of hourly manufacturing employees at our production center – and they’re just the beginning.
These initial workers must know how to fix electrical problems, as well as any issues that may arise with pressurized, pneumatic-powered equipment. They’ll also work with computers programmed with the instructions that power the various machinery along the automated assembly line.
In the past two weeks, Scout received about 300 applications for the roles. About 200 of them had the level of experience Scout wants. And just under half of those are being interviewed next week, said Clarice Henderson, vice president of human resources for the production center.
“These initial hires that we make in maintenance are so critical,” Henderson said, as many will go on to lead larger maintenance crews when the factory is operational.
Training for the future
The training center where these first interviews will occur is located within the South Carolina Research Authority’s Carolina Research Park. The office park is adjacent to Midlands Technical College’s campus in northeast Columbia.
Eventually, a second $25 million center financed by the state will open on site at Scout’s Blythewood factory less than 10 miles to the north.
Operating both is Ready SC, a division of the South Carolina’s Technical College System which provides customized training for companies bringing new jobs to the state.
Ready SC opened a similar space in the Lowcountry, after Volvo broke ground on its Ridgeville factory in 2015. That center, like the one in the Columbia office park, is owned by the area’s technical college and serves as a training space the state can repurpose to train workers for any company coming to the area.
Employees of the Lowcountry center, housed in a former American LaFrance fire truck manufacturing facility, have not only screened and trained workers for Volvo, but also for Mercedes-Benz Vans, Walmart, and most recently, battery recycler Redwood Materials.
SC readying training for EV workers across the state. Here’s what job seekers can expect.

“The space allows us to deliver both classroom instruction and hands-on training in labs designed to replicate the factory floor,” said Kelly Steinhilper, a spokeswoman for the technical college system. “Workers don’t just learn skills; they apply them in environments that look and feel like the job site from day one.”
Because these centers are to be used and reused for different types of employers, they’re built to be adaptable with interchangeable work stations, said Patrick Sellars, the project manager for the Midlands center.
Ready SC expects the center to have dual roles. Over the next several years, Scout will use it as the Volkswagen-affiliated automaker hires some 4,000 workers. And so will the companies that move to the state to supply its parts.
Richland County Economic Development Director Jeff Ruble thinks the center will make the Midlands more attractive to businesses across industries, not just those in the automotive sector. It’s a space where companies can mold a workforce, so they won’t have to hire experienced people away from other jobs, he said.
“That checks a big box,” Ruble said. “And it’s part of providing the best job opportunities for our citizens.”
“Having a fully equipped, flexible training facility already in place removes a major barrier for companies launching or expanding operations,” Steinhilper added. “When a company is managing a long list of priorities such as site selection, hiring, and permitting, knowing that workforce training is already taken care of is a game-changer. It shows we are serious about talent development and can sometimes be the factor that tips the scales in our favor.”
A third such center was planned for the Pee Dee but is now on pause since battery cell maker AESC suspended construction on its plant in Florence last month.

Future Scouts
After Scout’s mechanical employees are hired, Sellars said, Ready SC will move on to the next step for the Midlands center: finding and training the thousands of workers who will man the assembly lines.
People applying to those entry-level positions won’t already need advanced skills. Instead, evaluations will be more focused on aptitude — those who show they are coachable and can follow instructions.
Those future workers will likely include students coming out of the area’s K-12 school system over the next several years and beyond.
“We know that our future Scouts are sitting in kindergarten right now,” Henderson said.
That’s why the company is in talks with Richland School District 2 on how to get parents and their children to consider a manufacturing career after they graduate.
In particular, Scout sees promise in the students attending the Richland Two Institute Of Innovation, or R2i2.
“They have a pretty significant program, so we’re already talking about those students that are coming out next May,” Henderson said. “How can we now get them engaged? And is there an opportunity for us to do some type of co-op program to get them exposure (to Scout) before they graduate.”
At R2i2, students can graduate with multiple industry certifications, including in battery and electric vehicle technology and artificial intelligence. These certificates give students a leg up if they decide to go straight into the workforce or if they’re continuing education at technical or four-year colleges, said Alan Wolf, director of the district’s Student Innovation Center.
In the clean energy program, students build models that use wind and solar energy to power motors, Wolf said. They assemble a battery and build an electric vehicle that can travel for a short time period at speeds of 60 miles per hour, and they make battery prototypes that improve issues such as charge time and capacity.
This coming school year will be the school’s first to teach students about artificial intelligence — how it’s used in entertainment, health care, agriculture, manufacturing and sports analytics.
The school had 240 students enrolled in its various programs last year — 147 of them graduated with certifications, Wolf said.
He expects enrollment to rise to nearly 300 students for classes starting next month.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC_0601-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-25 10:56:14.265750

A new study from ChristianaCare’s Cawley Center for Translational Cancer Research at the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute is offering new insight into why some parts of Delaware see higher rates of advanced breast cancer and how to reduce that burden.
Published July 22 in JNCI Cancer Spectrum, the study builds on previous research that pinpointed two geographic hotspots for advanced breast cancer: Wilmington and Middletown. The new analysis delves into the underlying causes and is already shaping ChristianaCare’s clinical response.
“What sets this study apart is the depth of data and the precise geographic focus,” said Scott Siegel, Ph.D., lead author and director of Cancer Control & Population Sciences at the Cawley Center. “This is how we close gaps in outcomes: by figuring out not just who is affected, but where and why.”
The research team reviewed nearly 3,500 medical records over a period of more than a year, creating a unique dataset that includes the detection method, time since last screening, tumor grade, and molecular subtype. The results shed light on distinct contributing factors in each hotspot.
“This work allowed us to get a much clearer picture of what’s driving risk in these communities,” Siegel said. “Wilmington is our first test case, but the long-term goal is to use this approach to turn breast cancer hotspots in Delaware stone cold.”

The map generated by the study illustrates areas where screening is less consistent. It highlights how Wilmington overlaps with regions of poor screening and aggressive cancer types, suggesting a direct link. In contrast, Middletown did not overlap with these other hotspots, implying different causes may be at play.

The patient data, gathered from the cancer registry at the Graham Cancer Center, included 3,492 women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 2012 and 2020.
“In Wilmington, we found that reduced screening rates and a higher prevalence of triple-negative breast cancer fully explained the excess cases,” said Siegel. “That’s significant – it means we have identifiable, actionable targets for intervention.”
Delaware ranks among the top states for late-stage breast cancer incidence and leads the nation in cases of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive form that doesn’t respond to standard hormonal treatments.
By mapping cancer risks to the level of patient addresses, the study identified how the Wilmington hotspot intersects with zones showing both poor screening rates and elevated TNBC cases.
“This research highlights the power of data to guide better cancer care,” said Thomas Schwaab, M.D., Ph.D., Bank of America Endowed Medical Director of the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute. “By connecting what we know about tumor biology and screening patterns with where people live, we’re able to focus prevention efforts more precisely. That’s a model that can be applied well beyond Delaware.”
ChristianaCare has already started acting on these findings by embedding a community health worker in the Wilmington hotspot. This role includes promoting screenings, conducting risk assessments, and linking at-risk residents to prevention programs, including those tailored for TNBC.
“We’re using a precision health model and concentrating intensive prevention resources exactly where they’re needed,” Siegel said. “Wilmington is our first test case, but the goal is to expand this approach across other hotspots in New Castle County and downstate.”

In Middletown, the data revealed a notable number of advanced breast cancer cases among women under 50. While some were linked to screening lapses and aggressive tumor traits, those factors only explained about half the cases.
“This points to the likelihood of other factors, possibly environmental or related to population shifts, playing a role,” said Siegel. “We’re actively investigating that now.”
The findings underscore the ability of community cancer centers to drive change by zeroing in on high-risk areas with data-driven precision.
“Catchment area analysis is currently required only at National Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Centers,” said Nicholas J. Petrelli, M.D., director of ChristianaCare’s Cawley Center for Translational Cancer Research. “But 85% of cancer care happens outside those major academic centers in the catchment areas of community cancer centers, like ours.
“If we want to make real progress, this kind of work has to happen where most patients actually receive their care. That’s what we’re doing here, and it’s making a difference.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ChristianaCare-Research-Pinpoints-Drivers-Behind-Advanced-Breast-Cancer-in-Delaware-Hotspots-2-2048x1583-2-1024x792.jpg,,,2025-07-25 10:56:14.265750

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota lawmakers should expect an even tighter state budget next legislative session with revenues potentially $24.5 million less than projected, the Legislature’s budget committee learned this week.
Fiscal experts with the Legislative Research Council and the governor’s Bureau of Finance and Management briefed the committee Wednesday in Pierre.
They said the lagging revenue is due partly to recent wage growth in the state failing to significantly outpace inflation, which means South Dakotans are spending less money. 
The state relies heavily on sales tax, in addition to lottery taxes, insurance taxes and contractor’s excise taxes. Projections expect revenue will increase compared to the last fiscal year, but not as much as lawmakers planned for.
The two agencies project the state’s general fund this fiscal year, which began July 1, will be short between $18.3 million and $24.5 million compared to estimates that lawmakers adopted during the legislative session that ended in March.
Fiscal responsibility or neglect of state priorities: Surplus sparks debate about budget cuts

Paired with federal funding cuts impacting state programs and nonprofits, state Sen. Ernie Otten, R-Tea, told South Dakota Searchlight “every agency and group will have their hands out this year.” Otten is the lead co-chair of the Appropriations Committee.
“We’re going to have some very hard discussions coming on in just a few months, and we’re going to have to pick winners and losers,” Otten told committee members. “When we do this, we’re going to actually have to pick and know we’re harming people while we’re trying to help people. And this is just going to be the way things have to be.”
South Dakota reported a $63 million surplus for the fiscal year that ended June 30, largely driven by higher-than-expected revenue from unclaimed property. Next year, lawmakers plan to begin transitioning unclaimed property revenue into a trust fund and limiting the amount that can go to the general fund to support the budget.
“We won’t have the unclaimed property money to bail out the general fund next year,” said LRC Chief Fiscal Analyst Jeff Mehlhaff, stressing the need for accurate budget forecasting.
Unclaimed property consists of an array of abandoned or forgotten private assets, including money from bank accounts, PayPal accounts, stocks, life insurance payouts, uncashed checks, unused refunds, and the contents of safe deposit boxes. Holders of the money or items, such as banks, try to find the owners. The property reverts to the state after three years.

State sales tax revenue finished the 2025 fiscal year $3.7 million below projections. Bureau Commissioner Jim Terwilliger said monthly year-to-date sales tax revenue growth in the 2025 fiscal year consistently stayed below the prior year. 
“I think the only time that’s happened previously would have been in fiscal year 2010, which would have been right in the middle of the Great Recession, when a lot of states were facing a lot of economic and financial challenges,” Terwilliger said.
Mehlhaff and Bureau of Finance and Management Economist Derek Johnson expect this fiscal year’s sales and use tax to be slightly below the legislative adopted estimate, by about 0.6% to 0.9%, or between $9 million and $13 million short.
The agriculture industry started to show signs of strain last year. Farm machinery sales tax revenue was down 21% in fiscal year 2025, Johnson said.
The biggest indicator of state revenue health to Otten, he said, is the state’s lottery revenue. Revenue in that category ended the last year $5.78 million short of what lawmakers projected. Both the bureau and the council expect another shortfall in projected revenue for fiscal year 2026, around $4 million.
Insurance company tax revenue was one of the few sources to overperform last year, growing 9.9% over fiscal year 2024 numbers. In fiscal year 2026, the bureau projects it’ll outpace expectations again, bringing in $3.5 million more than lawmakers expected.
But more revenue in that one area doesn’t bode well for others, said Rep. Al Novstrup, R-Aberdeen. The source is a tax on insurance premiums, so it’s a sign of rising costs to consumers.
“When that goes up,” Novstrup said, “that’s a really bad thing.”

(Sherrill photo by Amanda Brown, Caldwell photo courtesy of Centenary University)Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee in the New Jersey governor’s race, announced Friday that she has picked the Rev. Dale Caldwell, the president of Centenary University in Hackettstown, to be her running mate in the fall.
Caldwell, who lives in New Brunswick and served on its school board for 26 years, is also a pastor at the Covenant United Methodist Church in Plainfield. His father was the late Rev. Gilbert Caldwell, a civil rights pioneer who marched with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
Sherrill’s announcement comes two days after Jack Ciattarelli, a former Assemblyman and the GOP nominee in the race, announced his own pick for lieutenant governor — Morris County Sheriff Jim Gannon.
Sherrill’s opposition to President Donald Trump has been a cornerstone of her campaign, and she wasted no time in looping Caldwell into that message, saying they both are committed to “challenging the status quo.”
“As Jack Ciattarelli is committed to Trump, Dale and I are committed to New Jersey, and I can’t wait to hit the campaign trail with Dale this Saturday,” Sherrill said in a statement.
She added: “Dale is the son of civil rights leaders who marched with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in Selma — and he’s followed in his parents’ footsteps and he has always been a voice for the voiceless.”
Caldwell said he has dedicated his life to public service to his church, students, and community. He echoed Sherrill’s anti-Trump warning.
“While we will be a voice for the people, Jack Ciattarelli will be a voice for Trump and the MAGA movement that is costing New Jersey our wallets and our freedoms,” Caldwell said in a statement.
Caldwell became Centenary University’s president in 2023 and is the first Black president of the private, Methodist university, which has an enrollment of over 1,000 students.
He’s a Princeton, Penn, and Seton Hall graduate who was a former deputy commissioner of the state Department of Community Affairs.

(Photo by Emily Elconin/Getty Images)Amid recent political rhetoric about rising crime and violence in American cities, a new analysis shows that violent crime has continued to decline this year.
Homicides and several other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, dropped during the first half of 2025 across 42 U.S. cities, continuing a downward trend that began in 2022, according to a new crime trends report released Thursday by the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
Homicides fell 17% in the first half of 2025, compared with the same period in 2024, among the 30 cities that reported homicide data, according to the report.
During that same period, five cities saw increases in homicide — ranging from 6% in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to 39% in Little Rock, Arkansas.
While the report’s authors say the continued drop in violent crime — especially homicides — is encouraging, they note that much of the decline stems from a few major cities with historically high rates, such as Baltimore and St. Louis.
More than half of the cities studied have higher homicide rates than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, though, the analysis found that there were 14% fewer homicides during the first half of 2025 compared to the same period in 2019.
The authors say more research is needed before crediting any specific policy or practice for the continued drop in violent crime.
The group’s findings come as President Donald Trump continues to amplify concerns about crime, at times citing misleading statistics and narratives.

In a Truth Social post earlier this week, Trump claimed that cashless bail — a practice that allows people charged with a crime to be released pretrial without paying money, unless a judge deems them a threat to public safety — were fueling a national crime surge and endangering law enforcement.
He wrote: “Crime in American Cities started to significantly rise when they went to CASHLESS BAIL. The WORST criminals are flooding our streets and endangering even our great law enforcement officers. It is a complete disaster, and must be ended, IMMEDIATELY!”
Some research suggests that setting money bail isn’t effective in ensuring court appearances or improving public safety. Opponents of ending cash bail often raise concerns that released suspects might commit new, potentially more serious crimes. While that is possible in individual cases, studies show that eliminating cash bail does not lead to a widespread increase in crime.
The Truth Social post also marked a sharp shift from Trump’s remarks during a June roundtable with the Fraternal Order of Police, where he claimed the national murder rate had “plummeted by 28%” since he took office — a figure that overstates the decline and overlooks the fact that murder rates began falling well before he returned to office.
According to data consulting firm AH Datalytics, which manages the Real-Time Crime Index — a free tool that collects crime data from more than 400 law enforcement agencies nationwide — the number of homicides between January and May 2025 was 20.3% lower than the same period in 2024.
Similarly, data released in May by the Major Cities Chiefs Association showed that homicides fell roughly 20% in the first quarter of 2025 compared with the first three months of the prior year. The group’s data is based on a survey of 68 major metropolitan police departments nationwide.
Researchers at the Council on Criminal Justice note in their report that it’s difficult to pinpoint a single reason for the drop in homicides, but they note that fewer people appear to be exposed to high-risk situations, such as robberies.
Most major crimes fell in the first half of 2025 compared with the same period last year, according to the council’s report.
Motor vehicle thefts dropped by 25%, while reported gun assaults fell 21%. Robberies, residential and non-residential burglaries, shoplifting, and aggravated and sexual assaults also saw double-digit declines
Drug offenses held steady, while domestic violence reports rose slightly — by about 3%. Carjackings declined 24% and larcenies were down 5%.
Compared with the first half of 2019, before the pandemic and nationwide reckoning over racial justice and policing, overall homicides are down 14%, robberies by 30%, and sexual assaults by 28%.
Still, more than 60% of the cities in the council’s study sample report homicide rates that remain above 2019 levels.
Motor vehicle theft remains the only crime tracked in the report that is still elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels — up 25% since 2019 — although it has declined sharply since 2023.
The council also released another analysis on the lethality of violent crime, showing that while violent incidents have decreased, the share of violence that ends in death has increased significantly. In 1994, there were 2 homicides per 1,000 assaults and about 16 per 1,000 robberies. By 2020, those figures rose to 7.2 and 55.8, respectively.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector) TOPEKA — Black Hills Energy residential customers will see natural gas bills increase nearly $6 per month after state regulators approved a unanimous settlement agreement Thursday. 
The increase is based on a residential average use of about 50 therms per month.
The Kansas Corporation Commission approved the settlement agreement that will increase base rates by $10.8 million, less than the $17.2 million the company initially requested.
Black Hills Energy provides natural gas services primarily to southwest and south-central Kansas customers. The new rates will go into effect August 1, a KCC press release said. 
The settlement agreement included approval of Black Hills’ request to refund nearly $3 million in excess deferred income tax to customers and allows the company to file an abbreviated rate case later this year to recover capital investments, the press release said. 
In testimony filed in the rate case, Black Hills Energy officials said the company has experienced declining natural gas usage per customer since its last rate case filed in 2021. 
Robert Daniel, Black Hills director of regulatory affairs for Kansas and Arkansas, testified the company had one new revenue increase in the past decade. He said a 2014 rate case resulted in about $800,000 in new revenue and a 2021 rate case brought no new revenue.
The settlement is a “black box” settlement, which means some items, such as capital structure, return on equity or overall rate of return, are not defined in the agreement, said Audrey Benham, regulatory accountant for the Citizen’s Utility Ratepayer Board. She filed documents for CURB in support of the agreement.

(Photo by Jnaiah Price)Twenty-eight-year-old Michaela Bonner has been working 12-hour shifts as an emergency medical technician in Norfolk, Virginia, for the past four years, while attending and paying for college to finish her prerequisites for medical school.
But now that President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending law bars students from borrowing more than $50,000 annually in unsubsidized federal loans for medical school, Bonner is worried her dream of becoming a doctor is financially out of reach.
“I get told, ‘Well, we really need you. We have a physician shortage, and you’ve done all this work leading up to this point,’ and that’s true as well, and it’s not that I want to quit,” Bonner said in a recent interview. “But there are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can’t take out the full cost of living through loans.”
The tax and spending law includes provisions that significantly alter the student loan process for higher education. The law halts current student loan repayment plans for loans that are granted on or after July 1, 2026. On that date, the law also terminates Grad PLUS loans, which have helped people pay for their higher education degrees and total cost of attendance. Current borrowers will be grandfathered in.
The federal law gives current borrowers enrolled in loan repayment plans for students based on income — such as those plans known as SAVE or IBR — until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. Interest collection will resume Aug. 1 for students enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan.
At the same time, medical or law school students hoping to get unsubsidized federal loans — in which the borrower is responsible for paying the interest at all times rather than the government — will only be able to borrow $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in areas such as history or philosophy have a $100,000 lifetime cap.


There are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can’t take out the full cost of living through loans.


– Michaela Bonner, aspiring medical student


The average yearly cost of medical school for the 2024-25 academic year ranged from around $42,000 to $72,000, depending on whether the school was private or public and whether the student was a resident or nonresident, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Some congressional Republicans say that students need to be working harder to pay for higher education, like medical school, on their own. Others say the caps put the onus back on colleges and universities to rein in the rising cost of tuition. But critics of this legislation say the loan caps are only going to harm students, especially from lower-income backgrounds, and will exacerbate physician shortages.
In recent years states have tried to ease physician shortages by implementing various policy solutions. Since 2023, at least nine states have made it easier for doctors trained in other countries to get medical licenses. States have also participated in interstate licensing compacts, allowing nurses and physician assistants to travel across state lines to work, so long as they are licensed in one state within the compact.
For student loan relief, more than 20 states have enacted legislation to address student loan forgiveness, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a group that tracks states policies. Georgia passed a measure that will expand a cancelable loan program for physicians working in rural and underserved areas. Idaho also created the Rural Nursing Loan Repayment Program, offering nurses $25,000 in forgivable loans after three years of service in a rural area.

McKenzie Richards, a health care policy fellow at the conservative think tank Cicero Institute who has been studying the pace of physician shortages, told Stateline that the national physician shortage could potentially exceed 100,000 by 2034. At the end of 2024 that projected number was closer to 64,000 physicians.
Richards said states will be looking toward more policy solutions should the student loan changes exacerbate physician shortages.
“We know what’s going to be happening coming down the line in just five years, so I think policies that states can adopt to get out of this are really important to be looking at now,” she said.
“The hope is that by capping [federal loans], it will encourage schools to lower tuition prices,” Richards added. “Then maybe they need to be admitting more students, which would have a great downstream effect for getting more doctors through.”
Other students will be in the same boat, said Lesley Turner, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Chicago and an economist.
“This is going to hit some students worse than others,” Turner told Stateline. “Those [students] in more expensive programs tend to borrow more, and so for those students they will need to return to private student loans or other ways of financing their graduate education.”
Many students were already questioning their capacity to go to medical school before the student loan caps, said Shannon Jimenez, dean of the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine.
“I expect that this bill, this cap, is going to push people out of primary care and into specialties to help pay off those higher interest rate loans,” Jimenez told Stateline. She added that caps will likely deter students from lower socioeconomic statuses from going into primary care — important in places like Arkansas, where she says there is a “maldistribution of physicians.”
“Many schools like us try to attract those students, because they’re more likely to go into primary care and serve in underserved areas. So it’s going to tie our hands in a lot of ways.”

Large states and more rural states will feel the gaps more deeply, said Richards, of the Cicero Institute. Louisiana, for example, is projected to be short almost 5,000 doctors from a variety of specialties by 2030, including close to 400 primary care doctors. Already more than a third of Louisiana physicians are close to retirement age — similar to the situation in neighboring Arkansas.
As for whether schools will just be able to lower tuition, Jimenez said, “it makes no sense.”
“We still function in a somewhat market-driven economy and have to compete with other schools around us, so our cost is based mostly on what we have to pay our faculty, and that’s not going to go down,” she said. The annual cost of attendance at her school is between $80,000 and $85,000.
Bonner, the EMT, holds a political communications degree from Regent University and now is studying biomedical sciences at Old Dominion University. She already has $20,000 in loans, she said, and for the rest of college tuition, she has paid out of pocket. Since she’s supporting herself, she hasn’t been able to save much.
She’d planned to take the medical school entrance exam next spring, but now worries about how she’d pay for living expenses while attending. “Medical school scheduling doesn’t allow for working, so you have to take out loans for living expenses,” she said.
“A lot of people, I feel, would be panicked if you had worked for eight to 10 years of your life and found out that all the systems that you were banking on in a really academically challenging space are disappearing,” Bonner said.
“I don’t see a path forward for certain, but I’m fighting to make one.”

Joe Gruters, of Sarasota and Manatee counties. (Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)President Trump says he is backing Sarasota Republican state Sen. Joe Gruters to become the next chairman of the Republican National Committee.
In a Truth Social posting sent out Thursday night, the president said that he was hoping that the current RNC Chair, Michael Whatley, will run for what is now an open U.S. Senate seat in North Carolina next year, thus leaving an opening for Gruters to fill.
“Fortunately, I have somebody who will do a wonderful job as the Chairman of the RNC,” Trump wrote. “His name is, Joe Gruters, and he will have my Complete and Total Endorsement.”
Gruters, 48, has been considered the favorite to become Florida’s next chief financial officer, after Trump endorsed him for that seat back in March of 2024, more than two-and-a-half years before the seat was expected to become open.
But that changed when former Florida CFO Jimmy Patronis stepped down from the position earlier this year to run and win a seat for Congress in north Florida. Despite the Trump endorsement, Gov. Ron DeSantis – never a fan of Gruters – chose Hernando County Republican Sen. Blaise Ingoglia to replace Patronis and said in a press conference announcing that decision that he would never have appointed Gruters, even if George Washington “rose from the dead and tapped me on the shoulder and said, ‘Will you appoint Joe Gruters CFO?”
“My response would be ‘no.’ I can’t do that without betraying the voters that elected me to lead this state in a conservative direction,” the governor said.
One public opinion survey showed that if Ingoglia were to face Gruters in a GOP primary for CFO next year, Gruters would be heavily favored to win that contest.
Republicans on board
Now it looks likely never to take place.
Gruters did not respond to an immediate request for comment from the Phoenix Friday morning, but other Florida Republicans enthusiastically applauded the president’s comments.
“As our former Chairman, we know he has what it takes to bring the @GOP to new heights,” wrote Republican Party of Florida Chairman Evan Power on X. “He’s proven, tested, and ready to lead!”
“What a huge moment for the RNC to get a leader like Senator @JoeGruters,” said former CFO Jimmy Patronis. “He knows how to win in Florida. He’s fiercely loyal to President Trump and he will settle for nothing short of landslide victory in the 2026 midterms.”
“I’ve known Joe for over 20 years and witnessed his strategic vision and steadfast commitment to conservative principles,” said GOP Congressman Vern Buchanan in a statement. “His passion, integrity and leadership make him the right person for the job. The Republican Party is in good hands with a Chairman Gruters. Congrats Joe!”

Vermont Health Commissioner Mark Levine announced his decision to retire in early February and retired at the end of March. A new commissioner of health has still not been announced. 
It is not clear why, but it is clear that with all that is happening with federal changes in health policy and health funding, it is vital to have a new commissioner.

Vermont had one of the best state responses to Covid-19 in the country, which was due to the strong partnership between the governor and the commissioner of health. We need to have this partnership in place in case of another serious outbreak.
In this time of uncertainty in federal health policy and health funding — and distrust in public health — it is important to have strong, capable leadership in the Vermont Department of Health. I urge Gov. Phil Scott to appoint a physician and seasoned health administrator for this important job.

The Fairbanks North Star Borough School District decided to close the school at the end of the academic year due to budget cuts. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Three Alaska school districts have joined a coalition from across the country — including school districts, teachers unions, parents and advocacy groups — suing the Trump administration for blocking $6.8 billion in congressionally approved education funding. 
The Anchorage, Fairbanks North Star Borough, and the Kuspuk school districts joined the lawsuit filed Monday in federal court. The suit challenges the withholding of funds as unlawful and unreasonable, as well as violating Congress’ authority and the separation of powers. 
“The lawless and last-minute withholding of federal education funds is not just a bureaucratic failure—it is a direct attack on our most vulnerable students. Less than a month before school starts, we’ve been forced to plan for cuts instead of preparing to serve children,” said Fairbanks Superintendent Luke Meinert in a statement announcing the lawsuit. 
The Trump administration has said it’s withholding the funds pending a review of the grant programs to ensure they align with the Republican president’s priorities, and to “prevent them from promoting a ‘left-wing’ agenda,” according to the lawsuit. 
For Alaska, an estimated $46.4 million was allocated across five grant programs, according to the Alaska Department of Education and Early Development. That includes funding to support migrant education, academic enrichment, English language learning, and other types of instruction, as well as teachers’ professional development. In addition, an estimated $1.1 million was withheld for adult education programs. 
According to the lawsuit, school districts nationwide are facing millions in budget shortfalls, and have had to “cancel orders for new curriculum, delay critical teacher training, pause contracts for services for English language learners, or take other actions to avoid incurring expenses that they cannot afford to pay without the money normally provided by the Formula Grant Programs.”
The Fairbanks North Star Borough School District serves more than 12,000 students across 33 schools, and has seen over $2.57 million frozen, according to the lawsuit.
“Without these Title program funds, nearly 200 education jobs are in jeopardy,” Meinert said. “Our classrooms will be less supported, and students will be left behind. This isn’t just fiscal irresponsibility—it’s a moral failure that jeopardizes the future of the very students federal law is meant to protect.”
The Kuspuk School District serves 320 students in nine schools across 12,000 square miles in Western Alaska — and has received national attention for its deteriorating school buildings and severe maintenance needs. It is facing over $180,000 in frozen funds.

Among the grants frozen was funding to support teacher training, school supplies, enrichment programs and English language learning, including for over 130 staff. “Because English is not the first language for more than 60% of the district’s teaching staff, sustained … training has been critical to ensuring educators can effectively support English Learners across subjects and grade levels,” according to the lawsuit. 
Superintendent Madeline Aguillard said in a statement the programs are “not line items, they are lifelines” for students. 
“These are not extras. These are the programs that give our students a chance,” she said. “When funding is blocked, it does not just stall services. It dismantles the systems we have built to reach those most in need. When the federal government walks away from its obligation, it is not a delay. It is denial. Denial of access. Denial of progress. Denial of the futures our students have a right to pursue.” 
For Anchorage, the state’s largest district by population at more than 43,000 students in 94 schools, the frozen funds are estimated at $11.8 million. 
In an interview last week on the district’s budget challenges ahead of the lawsuit, Superintendent Jharrett Bryantt said the funding freeze on July 1, at the start of the fiscal year was “severe,” particularly having just signed new contracts for teachers and staff. “If you offer somebody a role and no longer have the funds for it — it’s so unprecedented that the federal government would not essentially pay its bills on time because these monies were appropriated. This is not a budget reduction conversation. This is a executing the will of the Congress of conversation,” he said.

The freeze comes amid an ongoing state education funding debate with the Alaska State Legislature meeting for a special session on Aug. 2, as well as a dispute over local contributions to school funding. School officials said this combination of issues is devastating to public education in Alaska. Earlier this year, the Anchorage School District reported it had to lay off 42 staff positions, and cut more than $30 million in salaries, benefits and services.
Bryantt said the district had to immediately lay off five staff members following the funding freeze announcement, and transfer about a dozen more to alternate roles. “We can make sure that folks are employed. That’s my top priority, in addition to the continuity of our students’ learning,” he said, and recruiting and hiring teachers is an ongoing challenge. 
“Teachers are a national commodity,” he added. 
The lawsuit, filed in a federal court in Rhode Island, names the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, its director Russ Vought, the U.S. Department of Education and Secretary of Education Linda McMahon. It asks a judge to compel the department to release the funds.  
Alaska U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski joined nine other Republican senators in a letter to the Office of Management and Budget urging the department to release K-12 funds, as well as over $700 million for adult education programs.
Last week, the U.S. Department of Education announced it will release some of the withheld grants, an estimated $1.3 billion that goes to support after-school care and summer school programs, though it’s unclear when those funds will be received by districts.

(Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)When the Iowa House and Senate approve a bill unanimously, you might assume it was easy to get the measure to the governor’s desk. But appearances can be deceiving. Sometimes, a unanimous vote for final passage obscures years of hard work to pull a bill over the finish line.
So it was with House File 472, which took effect on July 1. The law will make it easier for Iowans to defend themselves when facing meritless lawsuits filed in order to chill speech. Such cases are often called “strategic lawsuits against public participation,” because the plaintiffs have no realistic chance to win in court. Rather, they are suing as a means to silence or retaliate against critics.
Iowa was the 38th state to adopt an “anti-SLAPP” law, according to the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for Free Speech, which advocates for such legal protections across the country.
If not for one state senator’s determined opposition, Iowa might have joined that club years earlier.
The long-running effort to pass Iowa’s anti-SLAPP bill illustrates how one lawmaker can block a measure that has overwhelming bipartisan support and no meaningful opposition from lobby groups.
Protecting the ‘core freedoms of the First Amendment’
House File 472 creates “a special motion for expedited relief in actions involving the exercise of the right of freedom of speech and of the press, the right to assemble and petition, and the right of association.” David Walker, a retired Drake University law professor and longtime chair of the Iowa Commission on Uniform State Laws, highlighted the bill’s key provisions in testimony before an Iowa Senate subcommittee in January 2025. (Iowa’s law closely tracks model language from the Uniform Law Commission.)
Walker explained how the bill “protects and encourages the core freedoms of the First Amendment,” preventing powerful forces from using nuisance, defamation, or other kinds of lawsuits to muzzle critics. Defendants can ask a court to promptly consider a motion to dismiss such lawsuits. After being sued, they have 60 days to file that motion for expedited relief. The court must schedule a hearing within 60 days of receiving that motion, and must rule on it within 60 days of that hearing. Defendants can appeal if the court denies their motion to dismiss.
Importantly, Walker said, the anti-SLAPP bill freezes discovery while the motion to dismiss is pending. (The court can order discovery “if good cause is shown.”) Without such a freeze, litigants can rack up huge legal expenses during the discovery process, which may involve depositions, productions of documents, or court appearances.
Many lawsuits take years to resolve. Walker noted that the Iowa State Bar Association’s litigation section strongly supported provisions of the bill that “provide a quick process for the hearing before the court.” The bar association was among a dozen entities that registered in favor of the anti-SLAPP bill in 2025.
Finally, the bill provides a sanction by allowing defendants to recover reasonable attorney’s fees and costs if they succeed in getting the lawsuit dismissed through the expedited process. That’s a “protection against Pyrrhic victories” in court, Walker said.
At the same subcommittee meeting, Pete McRoberts spoke in favor of the bill on behalf of the ACLU of Iowa. “Frequently, bad actors use the court system to stifle people’s First Amendment rights,” he told senators. Courts are supposed to settle grievances and resolve differences between parties. “They’re not to be designed to bankrupt people into submission against the intentions of the First Amendment.”
Walker brought senators a letter in support of the bill from prominent conservative attorney Jim Bopp, who has represented organizations including the National Right to Life Committee. McRoberts likewise reminded senators that anti-SLAPP bills are not partisan; the ACLU (which is often aligned with progressive causes) had filed a brief in support of President Donald Trump in a case implicating his political speech.
Lobbyists representing the Iowa Newspaper Association and Iowa Broadcasters Association also spoke at the Senate subcommittee in January. They emphasized that the bill would protect all individuals, not just media organizations.
The Institute for Free Speech put it this way in a news release celebrating passage of Iowa’s law in May:

“The new anti-SLAPP law is not just for journalists or activists, who are often common targets of SLAPP suits—it protects every Iowa citizen’s right to speak freely on matters of public concern. Whether posting an online review, reporting harassment, or speaking at a public meeting, Iowans now have legal protection against retaliatory litigation.
“By deterring meritless suits designed to silence speech, Iowa has created an environment where citizens can more confidently participate in public discourse without fear of devastating legal intimidation.”

(Disclosure: the Institute for Free speech works on around 20 issues related to political speech rights. As part of its efforts to combat content-based discrimination, the organization represented me in a federal lawsuit that prompted the Iowa House to grant me press credentials for the first time in 2024.)
Persuasive testimony at a subcommittee doesn’t always carry the day in the Iowa Legislature, but Republican state Sens. Jeff Reichman and Jeff Taylor and Democratic Sen. Matt Blake did advance the anti-SLAPP bill (then numbered Senate File 47) from the subcommittee.
The next step in the Iowa Senate would be a heavier lift — and wouldn’t have been possible without other pieces coming together.
A persistent advocate in the Iowa House
State Rep. Steven Holt began working on anti-SLAPP bills in 2018, largely because of a lawsuit against the Carroll Times Herald, located in the county next to Holt’s western Iowa district. A former Carroll police officer sued the newspaper after its investigative reporter Jared Strong covered the cop’s inappropriate relationships with teenage girls. (David Enrich described the legal battle in chapter 9 of his 2025 book “Murder the Truth: Fear, the First Amendment, and a Secret Campaign to Protect the Powerful.”)
The newspaper prevailed in court, because Strong’s reporting was accurate. But legal costs of around $140,000, combined with canceled subscriptions and advertising from locals who sympathized with the plaintiff, severely undermined the newspaper financially.
In an effort to save money, co-owner Douglas Burns cut back from printing the paper five times a week to twice a week in 2019. He created a GoFundMe page seeking to raise additional funds. He even contemplated suicide because of the stress, he later told journalist Dave Hoekstra. Burns and his family were eventually forced to sell the Times Herald in 2022.
As chair of the Iowa House Judiciary Committee, Holt could guide bills in his jurisdiction past legislative hurdles and deadlines. He also had the power to assign bills to members of his caucus. Republican State Rep. Dustin Hite, an attorney, floor managed an early version of anti-SLAPP legislation in 2020, as well as the first anti-SLAPP bill to incorporate Uniform Law Commission language in 2021. House members approved both bills unanimously, but they died in the Senate.
After Hite lost to a Republican primary challenger in 2022, Holt floor-managed subsequent anti-SLAPP bills himself. He introduced and led debate on a 2023 bill, which the chamber approved by 94 votes to 1. It got through a Senate subcommittee, but went no further.
Sometimes lawmakers give up on bills that keep hitting a wall on the other side of the rotunda. But again this year, Holt introduced an anti-SLAPP bill. Again, he referenced the Carroll Times Herald’s plight during floor debate in March. Again, House members approved the bill unanimously.
Why did Holt have to keep pushing the same bill over and over? And why was the outcome different this year? Two factors seem most important.
Change at the top of a key committee


When a popular bill fails, sometimes a lobby group is responsible. Last year, Kali White VanBaale wrote about the seven-year journey to pass legislation regulating non-medical “prescription switching,” over the objections of insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers.


But the lobbyist declarations show no outside group was registered against Iowa’s anti-SLAPP bills in 2020, 2021, or 2023. The adversary was inside the building.
A committee chair can kill a bill by not assigning it to a subcommittee, or by assigning it to a subcommittee that never meets, or by failing to bring it before the full committee, even if it came out of subcommittee with bipartisan support.
In this case, the obstacle didn’t appear to be state Sen. Brad Zaun, who led the Senate Judiciary Committee for eight years beginning in 2017. Zaun told the Des Moines Register in 2022,

        “I honestly don’t have any problems with the bill,” he said, pointing to the Carroll case as a reason the Legislature should take action. “Assuming I’m the judiciary chair in the future, we want to get something done.”

He had his chance after a Senate subcommittee recommended passage of the House anti-SLAPP bill in 2023. But Zaun didn’t bring it up in the full Judiciary Committee that year, or in 2024.
By many accounts, the roadblock was the committee’s vice chair, state Sen. Julian Garrett. He told the Des Moines Register in 2022 that the anti-SLAPP bill was unconstitutional because it violated a person’s right to a trial by jury. He also suggested to advocates that the bill was unnecessary, because defendants already can file motions for summary judgment. If successful, those can resolve a case without a trial.
It’s a safe bet Zaun would not have advanced an anti-SLAPP bill in 2025 if he were still in charge of the Judiciary Committee. In February, he signed on as a plaintiff to Donald Trump’s consumer fraud lawsuit against the Des Moines Register and its longtime pollster, Ann Selzer. Critics have described that suit as a classic example of a SLAPP that has no legal merit and is designed to intimidate the defendants and drain their resources. Plaintiffs seem aware that their case is weak, because they refiled the lawsuit in Polk County District Court on June 30, one day before Iowa’s anti-SLAPP law went into effect.
In any event, Zaun wasn’t in a position to kill the bill again, because he lost his 2024 reelection bid. As a result, Republican state Sen. Jason Schultz was in charge of the Judiciary Committee this year. His Senate district includes Carroll County as well as the area Holt represents in the Iowa House. Schultz and Holt live near each other, have collaborated on various bills, and sometimes ride together to and from the State Capitol.
Schultz declined my request for an interview. But the ground shifted in favor of the proposal early this year. For the first time, the Senate had a companion bill, introduced by Reichman. Previously, Iowa Senate Republicans had not filed anti-SLAPP bills.
Senate File 47 got a subcommittee hearing in late January. Brad Epperly, a lobbyist for the Iowa newspaper and broadcast associations, preempted some of Garrett’s objections in his comments at that subcommittee. Addressing Republican Sens. Reichman and Taylor, “because you may have a discussion in caucus about the need for this,” Epperly said, “I can assure you, the need is there.”
Although Iowa rules of civil procedure allow defendants to seek summary judgment, the costs can be quite high, Epperly said. “You can file your motion, but there’s not a state court judge in this state who’s going to grant that motion or even have a hearing, because the other side’s going to say, I have a right to conduct discovery. And they do, by our rules.” The bill lays out “a simple, expedited process,” using the same standards courts already use for summary judgment, but without requiring discovery.
Schultz put the anti-SLAPP bill on the Senate Judiciary Committee’s agenda for its Feb. 11 meeting, well in advance of the first “funnel” deadline for keeping bills alive. The video (available here) shows Garrett didn’t speak against the bill during the meeting, and remained silent as colleagues from both parties approved it by voice vote.
The Cedar Rapids Gazette quoted Schultz as saying after that meeting that Republicans on his committee decided “it is time to move” anti-SLAPP legislation this year. “We have 35 states that have put this in their code. … It’s a standard best practice. We think it’s time to go ahead and move the bill. And at the very least it is time for the full (Senate Republican) caucus to weigh in on it.” He added, “I like it. I support it and I hope we get it done.”
Carbon pipeline critics engage on the issue
Advocates for anti-SLAPP bills got some unexpected help last year from Summit Carbon Solutions, which is seeking to build a CO2 pipeline across Iowa. The project is controversial within Republican circles, mainly because Summit Carbon wants to use eminent domain to seize farmland along its proposed pipeline route.
Summit Carbon’s attorneys sent cease and desist letters in November 2024 to at least six Iowans who had publicly criticized the pipeline project, including former U.S. Rep. Steve King, Sierra Club staffer Jess Mazour, and two members of Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement. The letters accused the critics of making “false and defamatory statements” that “have now exposed you to significant legal liability.”
Some of the pipeline critics came to the Iowa House subcommittee on Holt’s anti-SLAPP bill in February. Mazour told lawmakers,

        “I think this is ridiculous, because what I’ve been doing for the last four years is trying to help, holding meetings to make sure Iowans know their rights, learning as much as I can about this project so that people in this state can know how to protect themselves, or what the truth is about this project,” Mazour said. “None of that should be punished. And I shouldn’t have to be worried about going broke, because I’m doing what I am granted under the U.S. Constitution, which is my First Amendment rights.”

Summit Carbon’s letters weren’t the main reason the anti-SLAPP bill gained more traction this year. But they may have fueled momentum for the proposal, especially among Senate Republicans who were on the record against the CO2 pipeline. Some three dozen Iowa GOP lawmakers, including Holt and Schultz, were part of a group called Republican Legislative Intervenors for Justice, which has joined some legal efforts to block Summit Carbon’s use of eminent domain.
Senators insist on meaningless amendment
Prospects appeared bright for the anti-SLAPP bill. It was finally through Senate committee, and Holt ran the companion bill (House File 472) through the lower chamber on March 11. All that remained was for Senate Republicans to bring Senate File 47 to the floor, substitute it for the House bill, and send the measure to the governor’s desk.
But weeks passed, and the anti-SLAPP bill was absent from the Senate’s floor debate calendar. I wasn’t able to find out why.
Reichman had filed an amendment to Senate File 47 in late February. The original version stated, “This Act applies to a civil action filed or cause of action asserted in a civil action on or after the effective date of this Act.” Reichman’s amendment would strike the words “or cause of action asserted in a civil action.” The apparent goal was to clarify that the bill would not apply to lawsuits filed before it took effect.
In mid-March, Holt confirmed to me that he hadn’t been consulted about the Senate amendment. I checked with Walker and other attorneys, who agreed that this kind of change to legal procedures would not be retroactive in Iowa regardless. So the amendment would not alter the bill in any substantive way.
My worries abated, then came roaring back in early April, when Iowa Senate leaders put the anti-SLAPP bill on the “unfinished business” calendar. Those bills are still eligible for floor debate, but many of them never see the light of day. Moving a bill to unfinished business could mean there weren’t 26 Republicans supporting it. (Senate GOP leaders generally won’t bring a bill to the floor unless members of their own caucus could pass it without any help from Democrats.)
It was also possible that Senate leaders decided to shelve the bill for some other reason. Every year, some bills with strong bipartisan support don’t make it to the floor.
Finally, Senate leaders might be holding up the anti-SLAPP bill in hope of obtaining some concessions from House Republicans on unrelated legislation, such as appropriations bills. We’ve repeatedly seen that kind of horse trading under Iowa’s GOP trifecta.
Eventually, the anti-SLAPP bill appeared on the Senate’s debate calendar for April 16. In what was unlikely to be a coincidence, Garrett was absent from the chamber that day.
No one but Reichman spoke during the brief debate on the bill. He withdrew his amendment from Senate File 47 and substituted that bill for the House version. Senators then approved his amendment to the House bill and voted 47 to 0 to send House File 472 back to the lower chamber.
Reichman didn’t respond to my inquiries, so I still don’t know why GOP senators wanted to change the bill in this way. I wondered whether some MAGA Republicans feared attorneys for the Des Moines Register and Selzer would use the new law to toss Trump’s frivolous lawsuit.
‘A tremendous victory’ for small Iowa media
When the House took up the amended bill the following week, Holt recalled his years of work with McRoberts, Walker, and others on the issue. He explained the Senate amendment to colleagues, adding, “Professor Walker has advised me that rarely, when anti-SLAPP legislation is passed, is it ever retroactive in the first place. So this amendment really does nothing” but clarify that the bill is forward-looking. That would be “a tremendous victory in trying to protect our small-town newspapers and media outlets from being put out of business,” Holt said. He again referenced the heavy price the Carroll Times Herald owners had paid for “telling the truth.”
Democratic state Rep. Megan Srinivas rose to endorse “a great bill, that is valuable for protecting freedom of speech, especially for many of our small-town journalists.” House members approved the bill one last time by 89 votes to 0.
To my knowledge, Gov. Kim Reynolds has never publicly expressed an opinion on anti-SLAPP legislation. Even though no corporations or industry groups had lobbied against the bill, I was concerned leaders of Summit Carbon Solutions (some of whom have donated generously to Reynolds’ campaigns) might encourage a veto. But on May 19, the governor’s office announced 25 bill signings, including House File 472, with no additional comment.

Once the bill was guaranteed to go into effect on July 1, I reached out to Douglas Burns, the former Carroll Times Herald publisher who now writes The Iowa Mercury newsletter on Substack. He told me,

        “Sometimes the truth does prevail, and that will be more likely in Iowa with this essential law in place. It’s a big win for truth, journalism and democracy itself. Community media, small rural newspapers and journalists on emerging platforms in often overlooked or undercovered parts of Iowa, those without deep financial resources, have more protection to probe and question — and eventually publish — public-service stories that hold those in power accountable. That’s good for all Iowans.”

In an ideal world, one senator wouldn’t be able to block bipartisan legislation for years, and committee leaders wouldn’t defer to one misguided colleague on something as important as First Amendment rights.
Credit is due to all the advocates and legislators who didn’t give up on passing the anti-SLAPP bill, and to Blake for defeating Zaun in Senate District 22 last November. Without that election result, Iowa would in all likelihood still be in the shrinking club of states that do nothing to stop deep-pocketed plaintiffs from abusing the legal system to punish protected speech.

(Photo by Jnaiah Price)Twenty-eight-year-old Michaela Bonner has been working 12-hour shifts as an emergency medical technician in Norfolk, Virginia, for the past four years, while attending and paying for college to finish her prerequisites for medical school.
But now that President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending law bars students from borrowing more than $50,000 annually in unsubsidized federal loans for medical school, Bonner is worried her dream of becoming a doctor is financially out of reach.
“I get told, ‘Well, we really need you. We have a physician shortage, and you’ve done all this work leading up to this point,’ and that’s true as well, and it’s not that I want to quit,” Bonner said in a recent interview. “But there are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can’t take out the full cost of living through loans.”
The tax and spending law includes provisions that significantly alter the student loan process for higher education. The law halts current student loan repayment plans for loans that are granted on or after July 1, 2026. On that date, the law also terminates Grad PLUS loans, which have helped people pay for their higher education degrees and total cost of attendance. Current borrowers will be grandfathered in.
The federal law gives current borrowers enrolled in loan repayment plans for students based on income — such as those plans known as SAVE or IBR — until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. Interest collection will resume Aug. 1 for students enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan.
At the same time, medical or law school students hoping to get unsubsidized federal loans — in which the borrower is responsible for paying the interest at all times rather than the government — will only be able to borrow $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in areas such as history or philosophy have a $100,000 lifetime cap.



There are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can’t take out the full cost of living through loans.


– Michaela Bonner, aspiring medical student


The average yearly cost of medical school for the 2024-25 academic year ranged from around $42,000 to $72,000, depending on whether the school was private or public and whether the student was a resident or nonresident, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Some congressional Republicans say that students need to be working harder to pay for higher education, like medical school, on their own. Others say the caps put the onus back on colleges and universities to rein in the rising cost of tuition. But critics of this legislation say the loan caps are only going to harm students, especially from lower-income backgrounds, and will exacerbate physician shortages.
In recent years states have tried to ease physician shortages by implementing various policy solutions. Since 2023, at least nine states have made it easier for doctors trained in other countries to get medical licenses. States have also participated in interstate licensing compacts, allowing nurses and physician assistants to travel across state lines to work, so long as they are licensed in one state within the compact.
For student loan relief, more than 20 states have enacted legislation to address student loan forgiveness, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a group that tracks states policies. Georgia passed a measure that will expand a cancelable loan program for physicians working in rural and underserved areas. Idaho also created the Rural Nursing Loan Repayment Program, offering nurses $25,000 in forgivable loans after three years of service in a rural area.
States are making it easier for physician assistants to work across state lines

McKenzie Richards, a health care policy fellow at the conservative think tank Cicero Institute who has been studying the pace of physician shortages, told Stateline that the national physician shortage could potentially exceed 100,000 by 2034. At the end of 2024 that projected number was closer to 64,000 physicians.
Richards said states will be looking toward more policy solutions should the student loan changes exacerbate physician shortages.
“We know what’s going to be happening coming down the line in just five years, so I think policies that states can adopt to get out of this are really important to be looking at now,” she said.
“The hope is that by capping [federal loans], it will encourage schools to lower tuition prices,” Richards added. “Then maybe they need to be admitting more students, which would have a great downstream effect for getting more doctors through.”
Other students will be in the same boat, said Lesley Turner, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Chicago and an economist.
“This is going to hit some students worse than others,” Turner told Stateline. “Those [students] in more expensive programs tend to borrow more, and so for those students they will need to return to private student loans or other ways of financing their graduate education.”
Many students were already questioning their capacity to go to medical school before the student loan caps, said Shannon Jimenez, dean of the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine.
“I expect that this bill, this cap, is going to push people out of primary care and into specialties to help pay off those higher interest rate loans,” Jimenez told Stateline. She added that caps will likely deter students from lower socioeconomic statuses from going into primary care — important in places like Arkansas, where she says there is a “maldistribution of physicians.”
“Many schools like us try to attract those students, because they’re more likely to go into primary care and serve in underserved areas. So it’s going to tie our hands in a lot of ways.”
Amid mental health crisis, new compact allows social workers to practice across state lines

Large states and more rural states will feel the gaps more deeply, said Richards, of the Cicero Institute. Louisiana, for example, is projected to be short almost 5,000 doctors from a variety of specialties by 2030, including close to 400 primary care doctors. Already more than a third of Louisiana physicians are close to retirement age — similar to the situation in neighboring Arkansas.
As for whether schools will just be able to lower tuition, Jimenez said, “it makes no sense.”
“We still function in a somewhat market-driven economy and have to compete with other schools around us, so our cost is based mostly on what we have to pay our faculty, and that’s not going to go down,” she said. The annual cost of attendance at her school is between $80,000 and $85,000.
Bonner, the EMT, holds a political communications degree from Regent University and now is studying biomedical sciences at Old Dominion University. She already has $20,000 in loans, she said, and for the rest of college tuition, she has paid out of pocket. Since she’s supporting herself, she hasn’t been able to save much.
She’d planned to take the medical school entrance exam next spring, but now worries about how she’d pay for living expenses while attending. “Medical school scheduling doesn’t allow for working, so you have to take out loans for living expenses,” she said.
“A lot of people, I feel, would be panicked if you had worked for eight to 10 years of your life and found out that all the systems that you were banking on in a really academically challenging space are disappearing,” Bonner said.
“I don’t see a path forward for certain, but I’m fighting to make one.”

From CalMatters economy reporter Levi Sumagaysay:
California homeowners and renters should prepare for their insurance premiums to rise: The Insurance Department on Thursday approved the first catastrophe model that insurers can factor into the rates they charge policy holders. 
Citing increased fire risks and rising costs, insurers have pulled back from providing homeowners and fire insurance in the state in recent years. The insurance commissioner’s plan to try to fix the problem and restore insurance availability includes allowing insurance companies to use catastrophe modeling. 
Catastrophe modeling combines historical data with projected risk and losses. Insurers had been pushing to use it in California just like they have in all other states. As a condition of being allowed to use the modeling in setting their rates, insurance companies will be required to write more policies in the state’s high-risk areas. 
The insurance department has been reviewing models since February and is continuing to review two other models. The department said the models should help avoid “year-to-year (premium) fluctuations following major disasters” while taking into account wildfire mitigation at the individual, community, state and federal levels.A spokesperson for the American Property Casualty Insurance Association said insurers are now reviewing the newly approved model. Companies that choose to use the model will incorporate it into the rate requests they submit to the insurance department.
Another part of Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara’s plan will allow insurers to also account for their reinsurance costs in setting rates. Combined with catastrophe modeling, this additional factor is expected to raise property insurance premiums for Californians in the short term — with the hopes of stabilizing the market. 
But consumer advocates critical of Lara’s plan have pointed out that other states that have long allowed insurers to consider both factors in their rate-setting have also seen rising premiums and availability issues.

Trump, Republicans defund public news

President Donald Trump signed a GOP-backed bill Thursday to revoke $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The cut will affect radio and television stations of all sizes across California, and some will likely lay off staff or limit their coverage as a result, report CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller and Cayla Mihalovich.
The money provides grants to National Public Radio, the Public Broadcasting Service, their affiliates and other independent public media creators. Republicans have argued that these outlets should be funded by private donors, not taxpayers. All nine GOP members of California’s congressional delegation voted for the cuts.
The defunding threatens smaller stations the most, since their budgets rely heavily on federal dollars. The PBS affiliate KEET-TV in Eureka stands to lose nearly half of its operating budget, while NPR member station KZYX in Mendocino laid off its news director after losing a quarter of its budget.
Besides potentially missing out on lifesaving emergency alerts, listeners could also lose local programming, which are shows that are produced in-house by the local station.

Connie Leyva, executive director of KVCR: “If we’re not here, the Inland Empire is just hearing about what’s happening in Los Angeles. We want to know what’s happening in our backyard, what’s happening at the schools around us.”

CA water regulators embrace Newsom-backed plan

State water regulators are throwing their support behind a controversial proposal to manage water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and the rivers that feed it, writes CalMatters’ Rachel Becker.
On Thursday the State Water Resources Control Board advanced a $2.9 billion plan that would direct water users to help restore fish habitat and relinquish some water in lieu of complying with stricter usage requirements. After a period of public comment and hearings, the board will hold a vote on whether to adopt the plan.
The board’s endorsement marks a critical juncture in the decades-long battles over California’s water regulations. If adopted, those who don’t submit to these “voluntary agreements” would face minimum flow requirements. Supporters of this plan include Gov. Gavin Newsom, major water suppliers and the state and federal agencies responsible for delivering Delta water southward.
But critics of the plan, such as conservationists, the fishing industry, Delta communities and Native tribes, argue that cities and farms should face harsher restrictions for depleting water from the fragile watershed, which vulnerable fish and other wildlife rely on.

Mike McKay (R-Western Maryland) in 2024 and 2025. The books are drawing ethics and campaign finance scrutiny. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Two self-published books by a Western Maryland state senator could face negative reviews from a legislative ethics panel and the Maryland State Board of Elections.
“The 90 Day Report,” a paperback by Sen. Mike McKay (R-Western Maryland) and available on Amazon, provides a detailed look at every bill the veteran lawmaker sponsored or cast a final vote on during the 2024 and 2025 General Assembly Sessions.
McKay sees the print-on-demand books as a cost-efficient modernization of the traditional lawmaker practice of informing constituents of their doings during the 90-day legislative session.
But ethics and campaign officials are looking at it against a tangle of ethics rules governing use of official titles, state employees, prestige of office and the commingling of state resources — namely legislative staff paid by taxpayer dollars — and campaign finances. Even if strictly legal, it could run afoul of ethics laws warning of the “appearance” of an ethics issue.
  Sen. Mike McKay (R-Western Maryland). (File Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters.)
McKay acknowledged that the books are under review by both the Joint Committee on Legislative Ethics and by officials at the Maryland State Board of Elections.
“I just think that it’s outside of the box, just modernizing,” McKay said in an interview Thursday. “I’ve just taken the exact same thing that it’s always been and I’m just trying to figure out a new way to communicate to the people who sent me down to Annapolis.”
McKay is a 10-year veteran of the General Assembly who served two terms in the House of Delegates before being sworn in as a senator in 2023.
Lawmakers routinely email and mail — at taxpayer expense — legislative updates to constituents, along with other information they may have requested. Legislative rules limit how widely the mailings can be distributed to prevent their use as state-funded campaign materials.
McKay’s self-published paperback books — and their cover charges — are not typical. The kerfuffle around his 2024 book was a surprise, the senator said.
“I wasn’t intentionally trying to sell books or trying to advertise the books or anything like that,” McKay said. “A lot of these questions, I don’t know anything about it, because it wasn’t our intent. And since it wasn’t our intent, I didn’t know it was a question.”
During his first decade or so in Annapolis, McKay said he had his staff compile information on all bills that got a final vote, as well as legislation he sponsored, and other issues that specifically affected his Western Maryland district.

	Staff would then copy and organize the documents into binders that McKay would provide to local officials of towns he represented. At the time, McKay represented a single-member House district, so he needed relatively few copies.
But soon the volume of copying caught the attention of House office building staff, who asked McKay to use the General Assembly’s in-house print shop.
But McKay said, “They told me they don’t do that,” so he went to a private commercial printer for roughly two dozen or so spiral bound books at a cost of $18 to $20 each.
When McKay became a senator, his district size tripled and providing more copies of the updates — which were also available at no cost on his campaign website — was becoming costly. Someone recommended he use Amazon’s print-on-demand service, where copies would cost him less than $6 each.
“I originally was paying for them myself, out of my business for the first 10 years of it,” McKay said. “I now have three times the (district) … I went from four municipalities — now I think I have 18 — and three county boards.”
  The book compiled by Sen. Mike McKay (R-Western Maryland) is drawing ethics and campaign finance scrutiny. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters.)
In 2024, McKay published his first book — “The 90 Day Report: A review of the 2024 legislative session by Senator McKay.” Copies appear to be printed on demand: An edition purchased by Maryland Matters earlier this year for $7.92, including sales tax, carries a publication date of the day it was ordered.
Inside, on unnumbered pages, is a recount in small print of “wins” for the three counties in McKay’s district. The book also includes updates on bills sponsored by the senator as well as every House and Senate bill that received a final vote in the Senate, along with how McKay voted in each instance.
In March, McKay said he was approached by Sen. Charles Sydnor (D-Baltimore County), co-chair of the legislative ethics panel. McKay described the conversation as friendly and informal. He said Sydnor raised some questions about thanking staff in the book, the use of his official title and state letterhead, a campaign logo on the back cover and a title that closely resembled an annual publication produced at the end of each session by the Department of Legislative Services.
State law bars lawmakers and other public officials from using the prestige of office to benefit themselves or others. All lawmakers get a guide to legislative ethics that warns against the use of official letterhead except for official business or constituent service. It also warns against the prominent use of official titles with a few exceptions, including resumes and employment-related biographies.
Other provisions bar the use of state resources, including office equipment, for “business, personal, or political campaign purposes.”
Lawmakers are warned against using staff for campaign work — a potential issue for McKay, since he pays for copies of the book from his campaign account. State election law requires that all expenses for the campaign have a “nexus between the campaign and the expense.”
“There was nothing official, and he was not in an official capacity, but he was the chairman,” McKay said of the discussion with Sydnor, adding that he attempted to incorporate the discussion into changes made for 2025 edition.
Sydnor declined to comment for this article.

“I believe I made 99.9% of the suggestions,” said McKay. “The reason I say that is just in case I forgot one of the suggestions that I just don’t recall. But there again, this was just communicated to me as we sat in the back room of JPR (the Judicial Proceedings Committee).”
McKay’s 2025 legislative session book came out soon after. It has more color in its graphics, McKay said, and costs $13.50 before sales tax. Maryland Matters did not purchase a copy of that book.
Over the two-year period, McKay said he has handed out as many as 100 copies to lawmakers, constituents and local officials in his district. He buys them himself and reimburses the expense from his campaign account as “printing expenses,” according to a review of his campaign finance records and an interview with McKay.
Outside of those copies, he sold four other books, including one to staff for the legislative ethics panel and a reporter.
McKay does not report profits from the sales of the books in his financial disclosures.
“There’s no money going into me making money for this, and the statements show no royalties … because I’m not making money,” said McKay, who provided statements from the online retailer that showed no royalty payments and no immediate eligibility for royalties. “Amazon, I guess, makes some money off of it. I’m just using them as a printing company, like just a local printer.”
He said he did not know what would happen to any royalties if he earned them by some chance.
“I didn’t get any advice on how that all works, because we never expected to get any money whatsoever from it, and we haven’t, and don’t want to,” he said.
McKay said the ethics panel asked for a meeting in May.




Ethics reports aren’t always secret
In Maryland, most of the work of the Joint Committee on Legislative Ethics is confidential by law. In a few circumstances, the panel recommends public disciplinary action — reprimand and censure — to the House and Senate. Recent public cases include:

In 2024, then-Del. Shaneka Henson (D-Anne Arundel) was admonished by the committee for her relationship with an Odenton church which she assisted in seeking grant funding. The five-page letter represented a rare public release of findings by the ethics panel.
In 2019, the committee recommended public discipline for two members of the House of Delegates: Del. Mary Ann Lisanti (D-Harford) was censured for her use of a racial slur. A month later, the House, acting on recommendations of the ethics committee, reprimanded Del. Hasan M. “Jay” Jalisi (D-Baltimore County) for “an ongoing pattern of unrepentant workplace bullying.”
In 2017, Del. Dan Morhaim (D-Baltimore County) was reprimanded for failing to disclose that he worked as a consultant for a company trying to open a medical marijuana dispensary in Maryland.





“I was interviewed by ethics: How’d you come up with the book? How’d you do this? All positive, not positive, but, you know, questions and all that kind of stuff,” McKay said. “And I answered all of their questions, and just as I’m explaining to you how we got to this point, and that at no point have I ever reached out to a lobbyist or anybody about buying the book or doing anything. It was just a print house.”
Exactly what the ethics panel is reviewing or when it might act or close its review of McKay is unclear. The work of the panel is confidential by law. McKay said he has yet to hear from the committee.
Often the panel is less about what is legal or illegal. Those issues are referred to prosecutors. Instead, the focus can be on the gray areas — the perceptions of impropriety — errors of judgment by a lawmaker that fellow lawmakers deem a dark stain on the reputation of the body.
Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) was unavailable for an interview.
“I am aware that there is an ethics investigation involving one of our Senators,” Ferguson said in the statement. “I trust the adjudicatory process the legislature has established to handle these matters with the seriousness and impartiality they require. All members of the Maryland Senate are expected to conduct themselves with the highest ethical standards, and I remain committed to ensuring integrity and accountability in our institution.”
McKay added that he met this month via video conference with staff from the Maryland State Board of Elections Division of Candidacy and Campaign Finance. The meeting came about because of issues McKay said were referred to the board by legislative ethics.
State Elections Administrator Jared DeMarinis did not respond to a request for comment.
In that meeting, McKay said the board asked for campaign finance records, receipts and invoices from Amazon. State law requires candidates to maintain 10 years of records that must be turned over to the board upon request.
McKay said he complied with every request.
The senator maintained throughout his interview that he did nothing wrong but conceded that if either the ethics panel or the board of elections finds differently, he would comply with their orders. So far, he said neither has had any further contact with him.
McKay did, however, lament the lack of confidentiality in the ethics committee process. The committee’s work is confidential, according to some, to protect public officials from being shamed by meritless ethics complaints.
Parties who file a complaint or are subject to one can disclose the existence of a complaint. The committee, however, does not publicly disclose complaints. In many cases, unless the panel votes to take public action such as censure or expulsion, the results of complaints are rarely made public.
“I’m not trying to think there’s any kind of nefarious or whatever, but what I think is an interesting thing is I’m being transparent and being held accountable to the people of District 1 who elected me, and to be perfectly honest, the people who didn’t vote for me,” McKay said.
“I’m still being transparent and accountable to them,” he said. “What’s interesting is this has now gotten out to two different reporters from either ethics or campaign finance, and we’ll never know, because they’re not going to be fully transparent and held accountable.”

The lament focuses on several points: Mayor Karen Bass was unimpressive in the early days after the Palisades Fire; much of the city feels unsafe and run-down; the Olympics are fast-approaching, and Los Angeles doesn’t feel ready to put on a show of that scale and significance.
These are fair complaints, but they include several fallacies and one key misunderstanding about what city leadership actually looks like.
It’s true that Bass was on a diplomatic mission overseas when the fires erupted in January. When she first returned, she seemed overwhelmed by the magnitude of the challenge. But the recovery has moved relatively swiftly, and there is no evidence to suggest that her absence or early uncertainty made the situation worse. 
Indeed, the fact that Altadena, which is outside the city limits, suffered precisely the same fate and then confronted precisely the same recovery obstacles — and that part of Los Angeles is rebounding at least as quickly — is proof that Bass’s contributions have helped, not hindered, the work in the Palisades. 
This was a fire, bigger than any mayor or fire department. Bass should be judged on the recovery, and so far, she has earned high marks.
As for public safety, while Los Angeles may feel embattled to some residents, it’s actually safer than it has been in many, many years. New updates on crime and homelessness reveal progress on both fronts. Homicides are on pace to reach annual lows in 2025 not seen in decades, and the number of people sleeping on city streets has declined in back-to-back years. 
That does not sound like failure. 
The sense of a city in disrepair is to be reckoned with, but addressing it — in Los Angeles, San Francisco and elsewhere — starts by being clear that the numbers do not support the uneasiness. For anyone who lived in Los Angeles in the 1990s, when more than 1,000 people a year were being murdered — this is a much safer city. And though homelessness remains dismayingly widespread, progress should be applauded.
Is the region ready for the Olympics? No. But the concern about the Olympics is a good reminder of what actually counts for leadership in this city. While Los Angeles is not facing a crisis of political leadership, it does confront a dearth of civic leadership. 
Leadership from beyond City Hall
It was not that long ago that the city’s mayor was just one source of influence in this notoriously diffuse civic culture. The Committee of 25, a loose but powerful collection of civic leaders, once exercised quiet leadership over local affairs. The committee, organized by insurance executive Asa Call, collected some of the city’s most influential executives and marshalled their efforts on behalf of city priorities, from municipal bond measures to the construction of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.
The committee had its failings — it was almost entirely the domain of white, Protestant men, for one thing — but it complemented the mayor and council as a source of leadership.
With the committee’s eventual demise, other notable individuals rose to fill the vacuum. Modest and shrewd, Warren Christopher acted as a kind of civic consigliere over his long and distinguished career. In addition to serving as a top deputy to President Carter and Secretary of State to President Clinton, Christopher chaired the colloquially titled “Christopher Commission” that examined the LAPD in the aftermath of the Rodney King beating in 1991. 
The commission’s findings about racism and brutality at the LAPD laid the groundwork for the modern police department. In all my years of covering local, state and national politics, I have never seen a commission whose recommendations resulted in more profound and lasting change.
Christopher died in 2011, but the baton of civic duty was carried forward by others, most notably billionaire philanthropist Eli Broad, whose civic contributions included school reform, the redesign of Los Angeles’ architectural landscape and the completion of Disney Hall, which stood as a monument to civic failure until Broad took it over and brought it to fruition, delivering the city an architectural and cultural gem. 
Mayors played a role in the work of those civic leaders — Mayor Tom Bradley created the commission that Christopher managed, and Mayor Richard Riordan turned to Broad for help with Disney Hall — but Christopher and Broad had their own standing and regard, independent of City Hall.
Ill-advised political aspirations
That’s what is absent in Los Angeles today. Where the city’s political leadership has its stumbles and failings, its civic leadership is altogether missing in action. 
Witness the aftermath of the Palisades fires. Bass turned to Steve Soboroff to lead that effort, but it quickly bogged down in misunderstandings about his role and whether he should be paid for it. He bowed out in April.
Developer Rick Caruso, meanwhile, convened a group of his own, but it drew largely from his political supporters, and was dismissed as a vehicle for his aggrandizement rather than for genuine city responsibility. 
What made Christopher and Broad effective, in addition to their generosity and intelligence, was their disinterest in holding elected office. Their advice was unsullied by their personal ambition, at least in terms of local politics. Not so for Caruso. 
Caruso could opt to be a civic leader in Los Angeles, but his ambition is too great for that. Instead, he aimed for political office and failed — Bass beat him by 10 points in 2022 — and he may yet try again, so he remains a would-be political figure rather than a civic leader.
Other sources of power and leadership have similarly disintegrated, most notably the Los Angeles Times. The Chandler family once stood at the center of Los Angeles leadership — for better and for worse — and the paper was a mighty voice. 
Today, The Times is a shell of its former self, and its owner is more a subject of ridicule than a leader. To take just one example, he recently announced his intention to create a “leadership council.” It sank without a trace. Who wants to be a member of a leadership council that shows no capacity for leading?
Which brings us back to the Olympics. One of those estimable L.A. figures who made a name for himself in actually guiding Los Angeles, rather than merely seeking political office, was Peter Ueberroth, whose signature contribution was in spearheading the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.
Ueberroth helped make those games a roaring success and set a template for the modern Olympics. That did not, however, translate into political triumph. Ueberroth was a flop in his ill-advised 2003 campaign for governor. 
That only underscores the point: Political leadership and civic leadership are different things. Los Angeles has the former, but it needs much more of the latter.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/110822-LA-StreetMedicine-LV_CM_42.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-25 08:56:19.115445

Even big stations are bracing for cuts.,"In summary
Small NPR and PBS stations in California are teetering after Congress pulled funding from public broadcasting. Even big stations are bracing for cuts.


Dozens of California public broadcasting stations will lose millions of dollars in funding after Republicans in Congress voted to strip them of federal funding, cutting off a vital lifeline in rural communities and limiting access to local news programming in an era of hyperpartisan national media.
While California broadcasters are assuring audiences that they plan to keep their signals running, they also warn that cost-saving changes are inevitable.
Radio and television stations of all sizes across the Golden State say that to survive, they’ll likely be forced to lay off staff and cut programming unless they’re able to make up the losses through fundraising. Their leaders warn that the cuts will disproportionately harm locally produced programs, the most expensive to create but among their most popular content, that inform millions of listeners and viewers. 
Republicans have long wanted to cut funding for public broadcasting, arguing such services should be funded by private donors, not taxpayers. Their efforts prevailed when Congress last week finalized President Donald Trump’s request to rescind $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides grants to National Public Radio, the Public Broadcasting Service, their affiliates and other independent public media creators. All nine of California’s Republican members of Congress voted in favor of the funding cuts.
Now, roughly 35 stations from San Diego to Hoopa in Humboldt County have lost critical funding.
While many public broadcasters remain hopeful that they’ll find ways to endure, all agree the rescission undermines the egalitarian mission of public media – to create a nationwide network that provides access to quality information, stories and music for local communities.
“That has been our superpower,” said Joe Moore, president and general manager of KVPR Valley Public Radio in Fresno. His station lost about 7% of its budget, or $175,000, from the CPB.
“The New York Times doesn’t have the type of investment in Alaska or in North Dakota – or on tribal reservations, bringing local news from these communities – that public radio does.”
Smaller stations whose budgets relied heavily on federal dollars to make ends meet are the most at risk of closure. In Eureka, the community-owned PBS affiliate KEET-TV stands to lose $847,000 – nearly half of its operating budget – due to the defunding of CPB. To survive, all of its funding will need to come from community support, since the station has no institutional backer such as a local college or school district. 
David Gordon, KEET’s general manager and executive director, says that as much as he hopes the station will stay afloat even at reduced capacity, he won’t make the same bold proclamation that, “We’re not going anywhere,” like some stations have.
“I can’t guarantee that KEET will be here once the dust settles from this defunding move,” Gordon said. He emphasized that he was speaking for himself and not on behalf of his station. 
“I hope it is, and I think there’s a good chance that it’ll survive in some form. But absolutely will it? I don’t know if I can say that.”
Nearby, Mendocino-based NPR member station KZYX was forced to lay off its news director after losing 25% of its operating budget, or $174,000, from the CPB. That means news will include fewer in-depth stories, such as interviews with city council members or county supervisors, said Andre de Channes, KZYX’s general manager and director of operations.
“There isn’t the time to source out those kinds of things,” he said. “So the news gets more like a headline news.”
The station serves roughly 130,000 listeners, including in Mendocino County and part of Lake County. When de Channes first learned about the CPB cuts, he immediately worried about fire safety, since listeners who live in off-the-grid rural areas without access to internet or cell service rely on KZYX for emergency information.
Those potentially lifesaving emergency alerts became a rallying cry for public media providers and their allies as they begged Congress to preserve funding for their stations, especially those in remote, rural areas that also tend to be Republican. Frank Lanzone, the longtime general manager of the NPR-affiliated KCBX in San Luis Obispo, said his station has sometimes been the only on-air source providing emergency information during severe weather events. 
“There’s been several times in very bad storms when we’re the only station on the air in our area because of either power outages or people’s generators ran out of propane,” said Lanzone, who has worked in public radio for more than 50 years. 
KCBX, which serves about 45,000 listeners from Santa Barbara to Monterey, will lose $240,000 in funding from CPB, about 13% of its operating budget.
“It’s going to hurt the stations and the people that listen to them who need it the most,” Lanzone said. “The most vulnerable, the ones out in the middle of nowhere.”
Local programs are most at risk
Both radio and television station leaders emphasized that local programming – shows that are created and produced in-house rather than purchased from another producer – will be first on the chopping block. To produce locally focused public television programming, stations must invest additional time, money and work on top of the membership dues they pay to be affiliated with PBS, which unlocks a large catalogue of programming that they can air at no additional cost. 
For PBS viewers in the Inland Empire, that likely means the loss of popular local programs such as “Inland Edition,” an Emmy-winning weekly half-hour public affairs show, and “Learn With Me,” an award-winning bilingual English-Spanish children’s show, both of which are produced in house by affiliate KVCR.
“The local stuff that’s so important to people is probably the stuff that’ll go away,” said Connie Leyva, executive director of KVCR and a former Democratic state senator. The station stands to lose about $550,000 in annual CPB funding, about 6% of its budget. 
She emphasized that the station also wanted to preserve its journalism staff – two full-time reporters and one part-time – who have recently focused on federal immigration raids taking place across the region.
“If we’re not here, the Inland Empire is just hearing about what’s happening in Los Angeles,” Leyva said. “We want to know what’s happening in our backyard, what’s happening at the schools around us, what’s happening at the Home Depots around us.”

Large stations and independents suffer too
While larger radio stations such as KQED in San Francisco are better equipped than their smaller counterparts to withstand the blow to their budgets, they too will lose massive chunks of funding that currently fund journalist positions and popular shows. Tony Marcano, who runs a statewide partnership network of 14 public radio stations and CalMatters known as the California Newsroom, said the loss of public funding will require even more collaboration.
“Smaller stations are likely to be more affected, but that doesn’t mean that the large stations are out of the woods,” Marcano said. “There’ll be pain.”
KQED, one of the country’s most listened-to public radio stations and the largest in California, laid off 45 employees earlier this month and lost 10 more from early retirement offers. The 15% reduction came on the eve of Congress passing the budget cuts and is KQED’s third round of layoffs in just five years. Though the station stressed that the cuts were due to longstanding financial challenges, KQED now stands to lose close to $8 million, or about 8% of its revenue.
LAist, the Los Angeles area’s largest NPR affiliate, laid off eight people earlier this year and has slashed 61 positions since 2023. It will lose $1.7 million in federal funding, about 4% of its budget.
The consequences go beyond newsroom staff and programming. The federal government funds repairs to transmission infrastructure and played a role in helping negotiate artist royalty fees on behalf of local stations. 
Radio Bilingüe, a Central Valley-based organization that is one of the largest Spanish-language radio outlets and broadcasts throughout the U.S. and Mexico, was in the final stages of negotiations for a $1.1 million grant from the CPB to improve its transmission equipment, which hasn’t been updated since the 1980s. But the funding rollback means it will have to find the money elsewhere, said Hugo Morales, the group’s co-executive director and founder. 
“You’re talking about transmitters that are 40 years old,” Morales said. “At some point, it’s going to give out, and we’re going to have to find somewhere else to raise the money for that.”
Morales also made the difficult decision earlier this year to cancel the construction of three additional stations across Arizona and New Mexico that would have primarily served rural communities and farm workers who don’t have access to broadband. The organization and its stations will lose $300,000 in annual CPB grants, roughly 7.5% of its yearly budget. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Radio Bilingüe shared vital information about testing centers, vaccine availability and how to sign up for social services in Spanish and Indigenous languages such as Mixteco and Triqui.
The loss of CPB funding will also jeopardize independent documentary filmmakers supported by the San Francisco-based ITVS, which Congress created in 1990 as an independent service with a mandate to increase diversity and innovation in public media. It received roughly 86% of its budget, $19 million, from federal grants. 
ITVS leaders say the group has partnered with hundreds of independent filmmakers to co-produce more than 900 feature documentaries distributed to PBS stations nationwide. 
“Public media is a space for all Americans,” said Carrie Lozano, the organization’s president and CEO. “These films are not partisan. They are, generally speaking, films that touch everybody’s lives. They are there in service of the public.”
In anticipation of the cuts, the organization laid off 13 employees in June, or roughly 20% of its staff. Lozano expects roughly 10 films to lose out on funding this year – a big cut from the 20 to 40 feature and short documentaries that ITVS typically funds every year. While the organization is determined to stay afloat, Lozano worries the loss of federal investment will prevent important stories from being told and create a domino effect on the rest of the ecosystem.
“There’s no question that this is a huge blow to the field,” Lozano said, “and to everything that surrounds it.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/100818-KQED-Radio-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C691&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-25 08:56:19.115445

Sears/Maryland Matters)After spending 32 years in prison for a double murder he did not commit, John Huffington is determined to sue those he says are responsible for his wrongful incarceration, even though four of the five individual defendants have since died.
“It takes two seconds to put you in, and 30, 40 years to get you out,” Huffington said Tuesday as and his attorneys unveiled his lawsuit against Harford County and five former county prosecutors and sheriff’s deputies involved in his case.
Huffington was 18 when he was convicted of the 1981 murders of Joseph Hudson Jr. and Diane Becker, a conviction he said was the result of misconduct by prosecutors and investigators who fabricated testimony and ignored or hid evidence that would have helped his case. He spent 10 years on death row and took 30 years to prove his innocence.
One of the main targets of his suit is former Harford County State’s Attorney Joseph Cassilly,  who he said knowingly withheld evidence and lied to courts in his case, according to a news release. Cassilly, who stepped down in 2019, after 36 years in office, was disbarred  in 2021 for intentionally failing to disclose evidence in Huffington’s case, according to the suit.
Cassilly died in January. The suit names his estate as a defendant.
His brother, Bob Cassilly, now serves as county executive for Harford County, which is named as a defendant in the lawsuit.
“Harford County government, in which I currently serve as county executive, has no role in this case – the county was never the defendants’ employer,” Cassilly wrote in a statement Thursday.

“However, as Joe’s brother, and as a longtime public servant, I am proud that Harford County has always supported the professionals in law enforcement and in the criminal justice system who protect innocent citizens from violent criminals,” Cassilly’s statement said.
Huffington was released from prison in 2013 and maintained his innocence through a 2017 plea. He was granted a full pardon in 2023 by then-Gov. Larry Hogan. Later that year, the Maryland Board of Public Works awarded him $2.9 million for wrongful incarceration. He received $91,431 for each year he was wrongfully incarcerated.
Huffington’s civil suit claims 10 counts, including malicious prosecution, false arrest and evidence fabrication. The 42-page complaint seeks to demonstrate that Cassilly’s office, as well as the Hartford County Sheriff’s office, knowingly fabricated evidence and withheld evidence that could have proven Huffington’s innocence. 
“What John Huffington’s complaint alleges. and what he will demonstrate in this civil litigation, is that there was no search for truth — certainly not a proper one,” attorney John Marrese said. He was one of several attorneys — from the firms of Romanucci & Blandin, Hart McLaughlin & Eldridge and Saller Ernstberger & McElroy — on hand for Thursday’s announcement.
Huffington had appealed his 1981 conviction and was granted a new trial before being convicted again. In 2013, he was released and ordered to stand trial again. In 2017, to avoid the risk of another trial, he entered an Alford Plea that maintained his innocence, but said prosecutors had enough evidence to convict him. He was sentence to time served and freed.
Huffington said Thursday that he became an active advocate after he was freed. He now devotes his life to helping incarcerated people integrate back into society. He said he owes that to his parents, who have since died, and to his siblings who are still alive. 
“I can’t help acknowledge 32 lost years, but what I refuse is to have 32 wasted years,” Huffington said. “Sometimes the only way to fix it is to make as loud a noise and bring the most attention to it.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_1868-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-25 08:56:19.115445

The Spiral Jetty lies between them on the dry and dusty lakebed. (Photo courtesy of Bryn Watkins)As the search for solutions to the shrinking Great Salt Lake continues, researchers at Utah State University opened up conversations with the biggest water users in the state: farmers. 
Among the findings resulting from those interviews is that farmers in the Great Salt Lake Basin feel they are “scapegoats” and “unfairly blamed” for the complex problem. They say amid debate around the lake, critics often don’t recognize that as the lake has declined, so has agricultural water use. And farmers argue that they have something in common with the Great Salt Lake — that their existence is threatened by the same thing: “unrestrained growth.” 
That’s according to a new report published this week on USU’s Community and Natural Resources Institute’s website, authored by Bryn Watkins and Stacia Ryder. Watkins recently earned her master of science degree from the Department of Environment and Society at Utah State University, and Stacia Ryder is an assistant professor in the School of Social Sciences Department at Utah State University. 



This article is published through the Great Salt Lake Collaborative, a solutions journalism initiative that partners news, education and media organizations to help inform people about the plight of the Great Salt Lake — and what can be done to make a difference before it is too late.


Agricultural water use accounts for 67% of water withdrawals that would otherwise go to the Great Salt Lake, according to the report. The shrinking lake poses a grave threat to the state in many ways, including its economy and the health of Utahns, so policymakers and researchers continue to search for ways to keep the lake healthy long into the future. 
“However, many solutions that have been proposed and pursued have lacked in depth input from those within the agricultural industry,” Watkins and Ryder wrote. 
So, last spring, Watkins conducted “15 semi-structured interviews among commodity farmers in the Great Salt Lake Basin about their experiences at the crux of these problems.” 
Watkins told Utah News Dispatch on Wednesday that those interviews included about 20 farmers in the area with diversified farms. They all grew alfalfa or other types of hay or crops. She said they also included cattle ranchers and ranchers with other types of livestock. 
All of them, Watkins said, expressed a deep sense of concern and care for the land they manage and the role they play in the food supply chain. 
“That’s their purpose. They want to feed their community, and they feel very responsible for it,” she said, adding that the farmers are “very seldom making a buck” and are often “barely solvent.” 
Some of their stories, she said, were “heartbreaking.” 
“They are experiencing the loss of their heritage as development encroaches on ag land,” Watkins said. “And they’re also worried about the health of their soil and water.” 
But as the debate over the Great Salt Lake rages on, Watkins said farmers feel like “everybody’s pointing their fingers” at them and they’re being “alienated by the rhetoric,” even though they want to be part of the solution. 
“When we pit agriculture against the lake, then we miss the fact that they’re both under the thumb of this bigger problem, which I think is growth in Utah,” Watkins said. “Unregulated growth.” 
What farmers told researchers



The report outlined these five key findings:

Utah farmers in the Great Salt Lake Basin feel unfairly blamed for the lake’s issues, despite reducing water use and shrinking agricultural parcels. 
Farmers perceive economic growth as a threat to both the lake’s water needs and their livelihoods. 
Farmers see the issue of the drying lake as just one of many environmental issues they must tend to in their relationship with water and land. 
Farmers frequently participate in water optimization programs and want to conserve water, but there are few proposed solutions that they see as sensible and impactful on lake levels. 
Famers’ key concerns about proposed solutions include insolvency, unintended ecological effects, and the loss of personal purpose. The report also said farmers’ “pervasive trepidation” around making changes for water conservation stemmed from “skepticism and distrust.”

 




	While farmers “certainly feel these connections to the land and water, they believe that when it comes to conversations about the drying lake, they tend to be viewed as the sole destroyers,” according to the report.
“Further, they see themselves as being used as scapegoats who are disproportionately expected to change their water consumption patterns in order to save the Great Salt Lake,” the report said. “Yet, they all note an important but often overlooked fact: as the lake has declined, agricultural water use has declined too.” 
One farmer was quoted in the report saying: “Everybody gets mad that the farmers use all the water. Tell me what, there’s one thing changed in 100 years since Bear Lake and this water system got put in 120 years ago. One thing has changed. Farming’s not getting bigger. Why do we have a water problem now?”

Farmers, Watkins and Ryder wrote, say they and the Great Salt Lake “actually suffer from the same threat: unrestrained growth that puts both the lake and their own livelihood at risk.” 
“So, while willing to participate in water conservation efforts like irrigation optimization programs, farmers are wary to cede resources to urban institutions they don’t trust and by whom they don’t feel respected or understood,” the report said. 
It’s not just climate change that’s threatening the Great Salt Lake, Watkins and Ryder wrote. Utah’s rapid population growth has also been contributing to its struggles, the report says, noting “a changing climate paired with human overconsumption has contributed to the drying of the Great Salt Lake.”
“Rising temperatures will lead to greater evapotranspiration and decreasing headwater streamflow and groundwater storage, resulting in increasing dryness in the Great Salt Lake Basin regardless of human water consumption,” the report says. “This in turn threatens the ecosystems, economies, and cultures of the Great Salt Lake Basin, accelerating the local impacts of climate change.” 
Looking ahead, Utah is on track to continue to grow, with a population that’s projected to at least double or maybe even triple over the next 40 years. Demand for housing is also projected to continue to rise, with the state estimated to need to build 27,900 homes per year for the next 20 years to keep pace with demand. 
“This creates a complicated issue where in order to address the drying of the Great Salt Lake, regional population growth must actually be coupled with reduced water consumption,” the report says. 
 Solutions?



The report urges policymakers to keep these issues in mind while shaping solutions for the Great Salt Lake:

The agricultural community is invested in taking care of land and water, but are not the sole problem and cannot be the sole agents of change. 
Poorly managed growth threatens not just the Great Salt Lake but also agriculture and the agricultural community’s options for reducing water consumption. 
The issue of the Great Salt Lake exists within the broader ecological context of Utah. 
That there is no one-size-fits-all solution for reducing agricultural water consumption. 
Solutions need to include farmers impacted by policies, and policies need to be tailored so that farms can have the ability to choose to pursue reduced water consumption in ways that work best for them. 
Farmers’ concerns need to be taken seriously and where possible addressed in policies, even if not all stakeholders share their concerns.
Time, effort and resources must be dedicated to enhancing trust and transparency when it comes to policy decisions for water conservation in managing the Great Salt Lake. 




Ryder said that to farmers, the Great Salt Lake “is one piece of the conservation puzzle. … They see the issue from a more holistic perspective when it comes to the environment and ecosystem.” 
“In discussing the issue, they advocate for a broader, more farming-friendly perspective to address drought,” the report says. “This includes considering how potential solutions for increasing water to the Great Salt Lake might lead to other environmental issues.”
For example, while discussing the potential of “water-intensive agricultural fields to be converted to solar farms,” the report said, “one interviewee noted that this could lead to other localized issues: ‘You gotta keep the weeds down and if you don’t, you either gonna have a weed explosion or a dust problem. You’re moving one dust problem from another.’”










“When we pit agriculture against the lake, then we miss the fact that they’re both under the thumb of this bigger problem, which I think is growth in Utah. Unregulated growth.


– Bryn Watkins


Watkins said one of the report’s biggest takeaways was that growth development pressures also need to be factored into the debate. 
“I don’t think it’s a matter of saying, ‘stop building,’” she said. “I think it’s just about building smart. I would like to see Utah grow up rather than out. It would be great to see more vertical housing, high density, small footprint, in places that we already live.”
She added that farmers feel “really on the back foot” when it comes to development pressures, and at the same time they’re also facing criticism from Great Salt Lake advocates who are “begging them to use less.” 
“We do need to use less — and also it would help somewhat if farmers were insulated from that encroaching development,” Watkins said. “If there were limits to zoning, if there were regulations on how many large plot homes (are allowed) to every small, high-density home, if that ratio were maybe skewed toward high density, vertical housing instead of these larger homes that take up a lot of lawn and a lot of space and gobble farmland.”

Should alfalfa be grown in Utah?
Ryder acknowledged that some argue alfalfa shouldn’t be grown in Utah’s desert climate in the first place. 
“We know alfalfa is not native to this area,” she said. “Should it have been started as a crop in a dry climate? It’s a good question.”
But she also pointed out when people debate the Great Salt Lake, some people say “we shouldn’t even be living here to begin with … it’s a desert.” 
But Ryder said both of those arguments don’t acknowledge the reality of the present. “The reality is we’re living here, we’re developing alfalfa here,” she said. “How do we address these problems while also recognizing that these things are embedded in life as a Utahn?” 
Watkins said there’s a slew of reasons why alfalfa does make sense as a crop in Utah and the West, including that it’s a great “nitrogen fixer” and helps reduce soil erosion. While alfalfa does use more water than many other crops, it can also have “greater water use efficiency,” according to the USU Extension, when comparing its harvestable biomass to other crops. 
Great Salt Lake is again on the decline, and summer likely won’t help it

Alfalfa is also a major part of the West’s agriculture. Each year, it’s grown on about 6.8 million acres in 11 western states, including Utah. 
“Nationally alfalfa is the third most important economic crop and its production in the West alone was worth 8.5 billion dollars in 2018,” according to USU Extension’s website. “It is also a major feed source that supports milk production (13.7 billion dollars in 2018) and the several other livestock industries in the West.”
Watkins said the debate makes her think about cream cheese. 
“Here’s the reality. I think that we forget, sometimes, when we’re talking about alfalfa, that we are talking about our food,” she said. “I don’t know that people always connect when they see a flood-irrigated alfalfa parcel … I don’t think they see that and understand the supply chain that leads to the cream cheese in their fridge. But that is true.” 
She pointed to Schreiber Foods in Logan, a major cheese and yogurt distributor that “makes most of the cream cheese in the U.S.” 
“We all have to acknowledge that the benefits of our food system do come to us, even as we’re all collectively suffering some consequences as well,” Watkins said. “We’re all in this together. So I think we have to have a lot of deep respect for the heritage that we as Utahns have with agriculture, including alfalfa farming.” 
Watkins said when it comes to the Great Salt Lake, saying “alfalfa farmers have to go” is “really unproductive rhetoric.” 
“We don’t have to silver bullet it and say that they’re the problem and once they get out of here, then we’ll be OK,” she said. “Our food system depends on them. We depend on them. We’re part of the community together, so I think everybody has to pitch in, and they’ll pitch in too. But they can’t be the whole problem.”

Brandon Harding, DHR’s food assistance director, said Thursday at DHR’s board meeting that the cuts will raise the price of running the SNAP program, which p[...]","A farmer's market advertising SNAP benefits in Florida. Alabama's Department of Human Resources anticipates a $39 million increase in state costs for the SNAP program by fiscal year 2027 due to federal budget cuts, with potential additional costs of $177 million by 2028 if the state's payment error rate isn't lowered. (Lance Cheung/USDA)Officials with the Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR) are preparing for significant financial impacts resulting from federal budget cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). 
Brandon Harding, DHR’s food assistance director, said Thursday at DHR’s board meeting that the cuts will raise the price of running the SNAP program, which provides food assistance to low-income families. Currently, the federal government covers 50% of SNAP administrative costs. Under the new resolution, this will increase to 75% for the state in fiscal year 2027, which starts on Oct. 1, 2026. That will raise program costs by $39 million. 
But the price could go even higher in fiscal year 2028. If the state’s “payment error rate,” which measures the frequency SNAP sends recipients an incorrect amount, remains unchanged from the 2024 fiscal year, Alabama could be forced to pay an additional $177 million in state match, or 10% of the SNAP benefit allocations. Alabama’s payment error rate was 8.32% in 2024, among the lowest in the Southeast.
“Alabama has historically performed well … amongst our peer states in the southeast, and many of these years, we performed well across the country,” Harding said to the board.

The state’s match could be reduced if the payment error rate is reduced to 6% or lower, but Hardin said that will require “upfront investments in staffing levels and infrastructure to make sure that we consistently hit that mark.”
LaTrell Wood, a hunger policy advocate with Alabama Arise, a nonprofit organization focused on poverty issues, said the “error rate” accounts for issues like missed payments, underpayments or data discrepancies, rather than intentional misuse of funds.
“There’s a much larger fraud question to be considered when it comes to skimming and program participants having their benefits stolen, and those dollars not being spent in the state of Alabama, but as far as maintaining and sustaining the program under current legislation, we will have to come up with the costs,” Wood said.
Hardin said that out of $1.77 billion issued in SNAP benefits in Alabama in fiscal year 2024, payment errors totaled about $36,000. He said that error on the recipient’s end is rarely due to fraud. The errors stem from changes in household situations, such as a change of address impacting utility allowances. If a recipient initially received a standard utility allowance based on their shelter costs but then moved into a place where utilities were included in the rent, they would no longer qualify for that allowance. This type of error would continue unnoticed until their next review, which happens every 12 months.
Carol Gundlach, a policy analyst with Alabama Arise, said “that is not the rate we should be focusing on. She said the error rate is more like an audit to ensure the department is complying with benefit levels and timeliness requirements, which is then checked by the U.S.D.A.
“I don’t want to be rude to Congress, but I almost think they pulled it out of the hat,” she said. “There are some other rates that do have to do with fraud, but it is not the error rate.”
A provision in the federal bill allows states with very high error rates to delay their increased cost share until fiscal year 2029 or fiscal year 2030, but Harding firmly stated, “Alabama will not fall in that.” 
“Because that is not how we operate, and we are not going to operate that way,” he said. “We want to make sure that we have really good rates and that we’re producing our stuff on time, that they’re accurate and that they’re clearly understandable.”
“We are going to continue to push forward. We’re going to have the best error rate that we possibly can,” he said.
To reduce the error rate, DHR is considering shortening the certification period for clients from 12 months to six months. This would enable the agency to identify and correct more errors. But shortening the certification period would also require a significant increase in administrative staff and associated costs.
Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, chair of the Senate Finance and General Fund Committee, which funds DHR, said in an interview Thursday afternoon that DHR had not directly contacted him regarding the changes but said that “that the big beautiful bill law is going to push costs down upon us, but we have no clue as to how or what that’s going to be like yet.”
Rep. Rex Reynolds, R-Huntsville, chair of House Ways and Means General Fund Committee, said “it’s got to be addressed,” saying that the legislature will have to make “corrections” to the budget. He suggested that the state might need to reduce funding to multiple programs by smaller percentages to absorb the increased costs of SNAP.
“We’re going to make this work. We may have to tighten other areas of the budget to make up critical shortfalls. But we’re going to remain positive about this thing,” Reynolds said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/snapmarket_0-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-07-25 08:56:19.115445

(Photo illustration by Getty Images)Parents or guardians of about 175,000 Nevada children are already ineligible for the federal child tax credit, and an additional 35,000 Nevada children will lose eligibility under President Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill, according to a new analysis.
That’s a 17% reduction in the number of families who will be able to claim the credit. 
Though the legislation modestly increases the maximum amount of the tax credit from $2,000 to $2,200 per child starting in 2026, the bill also implements more restrictive income requirements, effectively reducing the number of eligible households.
The law also prohibits children who are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents from receiving the credit if their parent or guardian lacks a Social Security number. 
The changes to the credit will render an estimated 1 in 3 children nationwide under age 17  ineligible for the full credit, according to a policy brief by the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University.
“Nevada, unfortunately, is in the top 10 states of having the largest share of children left behind,” said Megan Curran, the policy director for the Center on Poverty and Social Policy. 
Under the child tax credit in effect prior to the stricter eligibility requirements, roughly a fourth of Nevada children – about 175,000 – have been ineligible, according to the center’s analysis.  
Under the tax and spending law passed by the Republican Congress and signed by Trump, a third of Nevada children — about 210,000 — are expected to be excluded from the credit starting in 2026.
The center provided Nevada Current an estimate of how many children could potentially be excluded from the tax credit under the new law by congressional district: 67,000 in CD 1, 39,000 in CD 2, 42,000 in CD 3 and 62,000 in CD 4.
“The child tax credit is another one of those small ways that we support families with the expenses of raising children,” said Elisa Cafferata, executive director of Children’s Advocacy Alliance in Nevada. “To make it harder to get that benefit and that support is just going to make it harder for families to do what they need to do to take care of their kids.”
‘Extremely concerning’
The child tax credit in its current form already excludes thousands of low-income families nationwide, and not all households qualify for the full $2,000 credit that has been in place. 
Under the revised income parameters, despite the tax credit’s higher maximum amount, those households that continue to qualify for the credit likely won’t receive as much of a credit as they were seeing under the pre-Trump version of the tax provision.
The credit is structured so that each additional child means a family has to earn more money in order to access the full credit. 
The structure, Curran said, flies in the face of logic. 
The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, passed by Democrats in Congress and signed by Democratic President Joe Biden, temporarily extended and expanded the child tax credit. 
Not only did the legislation increase the maximum credit from $2,000 per child to $3,600 per child under 6 and $3,000 for children 6 to 17, it also made the credit fully refundable so low-income families that were previously ineligible could benefit, and households could choose to receive the benefit monthly.
Child poverty in the U.S. was cut in half over a single year.
“It was that combination of those two things that actually brought child poverty to the lowest level we’ve ever had on record in this country,” Curran said. “Hunger dropped. Families were better able to meet their expenses.”
The extension expired and efforts to continue those credits were blocked by every Republican in Congress, in addition to former Democratic U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia.  
“We have a very dramatic example of what a significant benefit a child tax credit provides to families,” Cafferata said, referring to the 2021 relief bill. “We immediately… lifted 44,000 children out of poverty” in Nevada. “Then that tax credit expired, and the number of children in poverty went back up, and now that’s that many more families struggling every day.”
There have been various proposals, including by some Republicans, to make the child tax credit more beneficial. Even Vice President JD Vance called for a $5,000 tax credit while on the campaign train. 
Instead the bill slightly increases the maximum credit per child to $2,200 while erecting more obstacles making it harder for families to receive it. 
A two-parent household with two children has needed to make $36,000 in order to qualify for the full tax $2,000 credit. The new law increases credit to $2,200. But to receive a full credit and that additional $200, the household must earn an additional $12,000 to meet a new $48,000 threshold, according to the center’s analysis of the tax credit provision.
For a single parent with two children, the household currently needs to make $28,500 to receive the maximum $2,000 tax credit. The threshold under the new law is $40,000 to receive a maximum of $2,200, according to the center.
The minimum wage in Nevada is currently $12 an hour or $24,960 a year. 
The center’s report notes the changes will disproportionately disqualify some demographics:

54% of American Indian or Alaska Native children; 
51% of Black children; 
44% of Latino children; 
65% of children with a female single parent; 
34% of children under age six; 
43% of children in large families; 
40% of children in rural areas.

Parents who lack a Social Security number have previously been able to claim a tax credit for children who are U.S. citizens or permanent legal residents. Those children are now excluded. 
There are an estimated 42,600 children in Nevada that are U.S. citizens and have undocumented parents, according to a joint analysis from the Brookings Institution and the Center for Migration Studies.
“These kids are citizens,” Cafferata said. “They should get the benefits of being American citizens. I think America does best when all our kids are able to thrive. This parsing out of benefits is going to, in the long term, not benefit this country.”
The Republicans’ multi-trillion-dollar domestic spending and tax cut package imposes steep cuts to Nevada’s biggest public safety net programs, including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), while bolstering spending on immigration enforcement and extending the 2017 tax law that favors taxpayers with higher incomes.
The same families at risk of being excluded from the child tax credit because of the new requirements are also the same households at risk of losing Medicaid and food assistance, Curran warned. 
The changes to Medicaid are expected to begin in 2027, after the midterm elections, the combined components paint a dire outlook for the social safety net many families rely on, she said. 
“It’s important to look at each of the pieces of the bill individually, but also it’s important to look at their combined effect, particularly on kids,” Curran said.  “And the combined effect on kids is extremely concerning.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/childtaxcredit-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-25 08:56:19.115445

Illustration by Getty Images.Editor’s note: Retired journalist and DFL activist David Brauer offered a different take on the convention in Thursday’s Reformer. You can read it here.
Delegates at the Minneapolis DFL endorsing convention last weekend sat for over 10 hours accomplishing almost nothing. A single ballot taken for the mayor’s race failed, with an incomplete vote count. 
Then, at 9:15 p.m., after hundreds had filtered out, the convention instituted a literal eleventh-hour rule change. Fifteen minutes later, the body had endorsed an entire slate of mayoral and Park & Recreation Board candidates for the first time in decades, including Sen. Omar Fateh for mayor.
To Fateh’s voters in the room, it was a triumph. To many outsiders, it looked like a train wreck. 
Is this really how Minneapolis Democrats want to choose their leaders?
The DFL endorsement process, where delegates meet to determine which candidates get the party’s support, has always walked a delicate balance. The party faithful want a say in their own representation, but it’s also troubling to have a few hundred people potentially determine who wins elections in a city made up of hundreds of thousands. 
One of the ways we can maintain legitimacy is through regular, predictable process. DFL conventions are notorious for their slow votes, rules debates and careful monitoring and disputes over delegate credentials. Those components are often miserable for attendees — but they maintain a sense of fair play. 
Any semblance of normality and regularity at the DFL convention first wobbled, then collapsed completely.
A novel electronic voting system was deployed the day of the convention. It malfunctioned, leading to doubts over whether all votes were being recorded. 
Bear with me as I walk through the flaws in the delegate math: There were 800 available delegate seats at Saturday’s convention, but only 579 votes were recorded on the first ballot. Typically, nearly every delegate votes on every ballot.
Unfortunately, no one knows for certain how many of those 800 delegates were present, and the credentials report contained obvious mathematical errors and impossible figures. But the organizers did report a “ballot pool” prior to the first vote — the number of delegates and alternates combined. It was 1,031. This implies that if almost every delegate voted as per usual, there were about 580 delegates, 450 alternates, and 220 empty delegate seats. This arrangement is mathematically implausible — there were clearly plenty of alternates to fill those 220 empty seats.
The more likely scenario is that the number of seated delegates and upgraded alternates was somewhere closer to 750 or 780, and several hundred votes were lost in transmission. 
The voting system was supposed to provide a confirmation of votes received, but hundreds of attendees reported receiving none. (I only received a confirmation after four attempts to vote.)
Initially, only Mayor Jacob Frey’s campaign vocally objected to this busted ballot. But there has been further recognition of the problem in the days since. Candidate DeWayne Davis failed to meet the 20% viability cutoff by a single vote and was dropped from contention; this week, he released a statement arguing that many votes had been lost, while pointing out other irregularities. Davis asserted that, absent these errors, he may well have survived to later balloting rounds. The ballot error was immediately obvious on the floor, with many delegates gasping in shock at the low total of votes. But ultimately, redoing the first ballot required a two-thirds vote of the assembled delegates, and Frey opponents had enough votes to block any kind of redo. So the convention went on, warped by this serious error.
Making matters worse, the convention organizers announced that the chief teller — responsible for the entire electronic voting system — experienced a medical emergency and left the convention. They reported that as she had departed, she’d recommended a shift to traditional paper balloting for subsequent votes. This announcement amplified confusion and frustration among the assembled delegates.
As the convention ticked towards its 10 p.m. stop time, tension grew. A majority of the room had voted against Frey, but split between multiple candidates. For many left-wing attendees, the possibility of consolidating those votes against the mayor was tantalizingly in reach — but time was very short, and park board elections sat in the way.
The convention began to race through high-stakes procedural votes quickly, resolving those votes by a show of badges, instead of an actual count. 
After multiple changes to the balloting process — including a briefly adopted plan to utilize paper ballots — Minneapolis Councilmember Aisha Chughtai moved to implement a sweeping rewrite of the rules at approximately 9:10 p.m. This would cram the seven park board races and mayoral race under consideration into a single voting period, to be mostly resolved by a show of hands. This restructuring of the process was passed in a brief 30 second vote, less time than it took to even recite the changes to the audience. 
Rule changes like the one proposed by Chughtai can be blocked by 33.3% of delegates; in the day’s single counted ballot, the mayor had secured 31.5%. As best as anyone could tell, even a handful of non-Frey voters preferring no endorsement would be sufficient to prevent this change. Nonetheless, no full count was ever conducted.
At this point many delegates began to leave, having lost faith in the process. At 9:16 p.m. Frey’s team instructed his delegates to vacate the convention, in a last-ditch effort to break quorum. But business continued in their absence, and only minutes later the left-most candidate was endorsed — virtually by acclamation — in every race.
Arguably the park board candidates got the worst of it. 
Each park board race was being considered by a separate set of delegates. But the sweeping Chughtai motion changed the rules for every race at once, so that delegates for Districts 1 through 5 were rewriting the rules for District 6, and so forth. It is a truism of the DFL convention process that delegates control the rules of their convention, but in the park board races, that principle was ignored. It is far from clear that a quorum even existed for each of these park votes.
In the end, after a dozen hours and dozens of votes, only two fully-counted votes ever occurred: the initial, dubious mayoral ballot, and a final paper ballot for at-large park board seats. Everything else was resolved in uncounted voice and badge votes. In those votes, convention organizers roughly eyeballed the room and decided whether the threshold (often 60% or 66%) had been met.
Beyond potential procedural objections, there’s a deeper problem: How can anyone trust or care about endorsements selected in this process? 
I walked in Saturday hoping for no mayoral endorsement, so the city’s voters could decide in November — but I was happy to accept any normal result. But nothing that day felt normal. The result only shows which subset of several hundred Minneapolitans was able to sit in their seats for 11 hours and then careen through last-minute rule changes invented on the fly. 
What does the outcome even represent? It’s hard to say. A certain degree of procedural chicanery takes place in every endorsing convention. But push things too far, and results start to feel random, pointless and unfair. 
On Saturday, the winning campaign surely knew there was a problem with the vote count, but refused to fix the problem, because it redounded to their benefit. Is that really how the Minneapolis DFL wants to pick its first mayoral endorsee in decades?
Speaking personally, this is not how I want my city’s leaders chosen. If the DFL wants voters to take it seriously, it needs to ensure conventions don’t devolve into high-stakes gamesmanship for insiders.

Ideally, even losing candidates should leave feeling like they got a fair shake, not that they got cheated. Irregularity, by contrast, breeds illegitimacy. 
And if our convention process can’t produce legitimate results, maybe the DFL should abolish it altogether.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/VOTING-MAZE-1024x540.jpeg,,,2025-07-25 08:56:19.115445

Mike Kehoe talks with the State Board of Education meeting during its December meeting before officially taking office in January (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).The Missouri State Board of Education has an empty seat, chronically vacant since lawmakers created a position for a teacher to advise the board seven years ago.
Like the other board members, the spot is appointed by the governor. But former Gov. Mike Parson, who took office shortly before the seat was created, never chose someone for the position. And thus far, Gov. Mike Kehoe hasn’t either.
“We would like to see an active classroom teacher be on the state board to provide that perspective of someone who’s in the classroom now and say what the immediate needs of educators and students are in the classroom,” Mark Jones, communications director for the Missouri branch of the National Education Association, told The Independent.
The State Board of Education, at its board retreat in July, discussed the vacancy during a discussion of the board’s legal responsibilities.
“This position still hasn’t been appointed, and I don’t know if there are any plans to do that at this point,” Sarah Madden, general counsel for the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, told the board.
Pamela Westbrooks-Hodge, a board member from Pasadena Hills, questioned why the seat was empty.
“I would hope there’s a sense of urgency,” she said.
Madden responded that she didn’t have an answer for why the position has never been filled. 
Despite the position being largely unpaid apart from expense reimbursement and lacking voting authority, teachers have been willing to step up.
“Those teachers that are there every day in the classroom, they have that firsthand knowledge, so they’re able to share that with the board,” said Matthew Michelson, director of education policy at Missouri State Teachers Association. “A lot of them would want to do that, and they would want to be able to explain how decisions impact classroom teachers or how it impacts the profession.”
Jones said he knows two former Missouri Teacher of the Year awardees who have inquired about becoming the teacher member but never got tapped to join the board.
State law requires that they must be an “active classroom teacher” with at least five years of experience. The requirement to be an active teacher is important, Michelson told The Independent, because the state of education moves quickly.
“Even if you took a teacher from 2019 pre-COVID and you put them on the state board, I don’t know that they would have the same perspective as someone who was in the classroom last year,” he said. “Things have just evolved so quickly, so having someone that is currently in the classroom and that is dealing with the issues of today is really important.”
The other board members are barred from having direct ties to the classroom, with statute restricting them from being “connected, either as an official or as an employee, with any public, private, or denominational school, college or university.”
 Former state Rep. Becky Ruth speaks during House debate in 2021 (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
The idea for a teacher representative came over a decade ago, Michelson said, with a member of the teacher’s association pitching it. Then-state Rep. Becky Ruth, a Republican from Festus and a past president of the teachers association, took the idea to the state legislature in 2015.
Her original bill asked for voters to weigh in on requiring three members of the eight-member board to be educators. By 2018, the legislation evolved to propose adding a teacher as a non-voting member, and it passed as part of an omnibus education bill.
“Ultimately it ended up being more of an advisory position because, frankly, that is what the legislature was more inclined to get something passed with,” Michelson said.
At the time, he never would have imagined that the seat would sit empty for years.
Board vacancies are not rare in Missouri. According to a state website dedicated to boards and commissions, there are over 1,000 positions left vacant or filled with a member serving on an expired term.
Some boards and commissions, like the Citizen’s Land Development Cooperative Commission, are completely vacant. But the State Board of Education rarely has its voting-member positions unfilled.
“It just depends on what the priorities of the governor are and what other boards and commissions he needs to fill,” Jones said. “But I think seven years is a long time to go without a direct teacher voice to the board.”

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo and the Democratic-controlled Nevada State Legislature clashed on myriad issues this year, leading to a record 87 vetoes during the session and impasses on several policy issues.
For better or worse, libraries were a casualty of inaction.
Advocacy organization EveryLibrary this month analyzed bills introduced into state legislatures during the first half of this year and found an increase in both the number of bills meant to restrict libraries and the number of bills to protect them
They identified 133 bills in 33 states that they believe would damage libraries, including bills to criminalize the actions of library staff, restrict library funding, or redefine obscenity. While many died, 14 had passed as of mid-July and several were still alive in other states, an increase over the previous year.
Meanwhile, 76 bills in 32 states were introduced to protect or extend library services, including bills that protect against censorship and affirm a “right to read.”
In Nevada, two bills designed to protect libraries were passed by legislators but rejected by the governor.
Assembly Bill 445 and Assembly Bill 416 were both Democratic-sponsored bills that received some bipartisan support. Both were vetoed by Lombardo.
AB416, playfully described as a “ban book bans” bill, would have prohibited school boards, school employees and volunteers from limiting access to library materials simply based on content. It would have created a formal process for challenging library materials.
The bill also would have made it a felony to use force, coercion or intimidation to attempt to prevent access to library materials.
Lombardo, in his veto letter, said the bill would remove “critical decision-making authority” from schools, districts and parents. He also raised the issue of constitutionality, writing that the bill may prohibit protected speech because it bans “retaliation” but doesn’t define what that is.
The second bill, AB445, sought to shield staff at public libraries, including at schools, from criminal or civil liability for providing access to or assisting patrons in accessing library materials, so long as they were acting “in good faith.”
Lombardo, in his veto letter, called the bill “untenable due to its vague and overly broad language” and said it undermines oversight by removing accountability.
PEN America documented 10,046 instances of book bans during the 2023-2024 school year, marking a substantial  increase over the prior three years.
Their database includes no instances of book bans in Nevada. Still, public schools and libraries in the Silver State have seen public outcry for having books with depictions of sex, LGBTQ characters, or people of color. Last summer, Washoe County School Board saw a coordinated flood of public comments urging trustees to remove certain books.
This year’s legislative session also saw a group of six Senate Republicans sponsor a bill that would have required every public school to establish and maintain a list of all print and digital materials available in the school library, as well as all instructional materials. While not included in EveryLibrary’s analysis, and not explicitly about banning books, such databases are typically designed to make it easier for groups to identify and challenge materials they do not agree with.
That proposal, Senate Bill 248, was never given a committee hearing, an unsurprising outcome given the Democrats’s control of the state Legislature.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-1556466811.jpg,,,2025-07-25 10:56:14.265750

(Photo by Giuseppe LoPiccolo/Capital News Service)Maryland has lost 12,700 federal jobs since the beginning of the second Trump administration in January, a top state finance official said Thursday.
Ben Siegel, the Maryland deputy comptroller for policy, public works and investment, said the loss is the most significant in the state since the federal government’s budget sequestration from 2013-14, when about 8,000 jobs were lost over two years.
“These are people’s lives, right? These are individuals,” Siegel said. “We look at the stats and the data, but it’s really about people.”
A spokesperson for the state Department of Labor said Thursday that the cuts, which do not include federal contractors, are the largest of any U.S. state.
During the virtual meeting with state lawmakers and members of the public Thursday, Seigel and Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman spoke about the impacts federal policy changes and funding cuts have had on Maryland’s workers and the economy.
“In a nutshell, we’ve had a special relationship with the federal government for many years,” Lierman said Thursday. “It’s been a symbiotic relationship. Not only do we benefit from having a large number of federal employees, employees who work at the federal government in Maryland, but the federal government has benefited from our highly skilled workforce, our fantastic universities and public school system.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But as President Donald Trump continues his efforts to slash federal spending and lower payrolls, few states feel as much of an impact as Maryland, which has the third-most federal workers in the U.S. — behind only Virginia and Washington, D.C., itself.
Last month, Lierman’s office released a report conducted alongside the University of Maryland, College Park’s Robert H. Smith School of Business that analyzed the state’s relationship with, and economic dependence on, the federal government.
That report called the federal government Maryland’s “economic engine.” Last year, the state received more than $150 billion in federal wages and retirement income, contracts, grants, and direct payments, which includes Social Security. That makes up 10% of the state’s entire Gross Domestic Product.
All told, there are almost 230,000 residents employed by the federal government, making up about 6% of the total workforce and almost $27 billion in wages, the report said.
Lierman said the report was created to give the state a baseline understanding of the importance of federal support for Maryland’s economy as it tracks changes going forward.
“We have had a happy marriage,” Lierman said. “But we are really teetering now and sort of counting up the assets, because we may be splitting.”
The meeting came less than a week after the U.S. Department of Labor released its monthly jobs report, which showed that Maryland lost about 8,500 jobs in June. Of those positions, there was an estimated decrease of 3,500 federal jobs — the largest single-month drop in almost three decades.
“We saw pretty major job losses in the June jobs report for Maryland, and that data will eventually find its way to our revenue,” Lierman said.
In March, the state’s Board of Revenue Estimates projected that about 30,000 federal workers in Maryland would lose their jobs this year. That would see a total loss of about $3 billion in wages, the board estimated.
Seigel said at the board’s next meeting in September, it will release updated estimates for the year.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_3757-e1743190066700.jpg,,,2025-07-25 07:56:24.525544

While the Palisades Nuclear Plant closed in May 2022, the facility has been cleared to bring in new fuel and transition its operators to on-shift status. According to the plant’s owner, Holtec International, the facility will generate more than 800  megawatts of carbon-free energy, enough to power more than 800,000 households. 
“This is a proud and historic moment for our team, for Michigan, and for the United States,” Holtec International President Kelly Trice said in a statement. “The [Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s] approval to transition Palisades back to an operating license represents an unprecedented milestone in U.S. nuclear energy. Our mission remains clear: to restart Palisades safely, securely, reliably, and in support of America’s energy future – while supporting local jobs and economic growth for decades to come.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Restarting the power plant has been a key priority for politicians on both sides of the aisle at both the state and federal level, with the Trump administration recently disbursing the fourth payment in a $1.5 billion loan for the restart announced under former President Joe Biden. However, the project is not without its detractors. 
Kevin Kamps of the anti-nuclear advocacy group Beyond Nuclear argued the plant is not a done deal, with the group planning to appeal against the final approval of three license amendment requests in federal court. 
Residents living near the plant have also raised health concerns, with one study finding residents living near the plant are five times more likely to develop thyroid cancer compared to the lifetime potential of the rest of the nation.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/P8120192-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-25 07:56:24.525544

Kate Lewton  is a reporter with Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
ROCHESTER — Liberty Hill Farm is straight out of a movie set: stately dairy cows, grandkids playing in the grass, barn cats napping on the porch.  Beth and Bob Kennett bought the picturesque farmhouse in 1979 and five years later began hosting visitors for overnight stays. Added income for the Kennetts, a taste of a classic Vermont scene for their guests. 
Today, the practice has a name: agritourism. 
Beth Kennett still remembers the first family the farm hosted in 1984 that encouraged them to take on the second stream of income.
“We started in February with a family from New Jersey with five kids here for a whole week to ski at the Middlebury College Snow Bowl,” Kennett said. “They said if I could take care of them and their five kids, I could take care of anybody. And they still come back — they brought their grandkids.”
In order to combat changing markets, Vermont farmers are implementing agritourism experiences such as farm stays, tours and more to diversify their incomes, with the help of growing support systems from the University of Vermont’s Extension Office and the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets.
Diversification like farm stays are important because farmland consolidation has made it harder for smaller farms to compete with their larger industrial counterparts. There are more than a million acres of farmland in Vermont, but  313 dairy farms were lost since the 2017 census. Farms counted by the census must produce at least $1,000 in annual agriculture sales. More than 50% of Vermont farms sell less than $10,000 each year, while roughly a fifth sell over $100,00 dollars. Often other forms of income are needed for livable earnings. 
Selina Rooney, a former dairy farmer, helps run her family’s sugaring business, Rooney Farm, in Morrisville. She works for the state agricultural agency to help implement agritourism, and said that while no one is getting rich from agritourism, it’s a necessary and creative way to make an additional on-farm profit.
“We’re in an industry where we’re price takers instead of price makers. We’re told how much we’re gonna get for our milk, or our timber, or our maple,” Rooney said. “Being a price taker, you have to figure out other sources of income.”
The term agritourism might feel new to the public, but opening up farms to the public is an old practice that has existed for hundreds of years, according to Dr. Lisa Chase of UVM Extension, who said said the concept term originated in Italy. 
“They were seeing rural migration to the cities, but they had landscapes and farm buildings that were thousands of years old and falling into disrepair,” Chase said of Italians. “So they came up with incentives.” 
In 1985 Italy passed the Agritourism Law, which provided grants and incentives to farmers coming back to the countryside and opening their farm for visitors and education. The name has slowly gained traction since and Chase helped to delegate its spelling, with an “i” and not an “o”, in Vermont. 
In Vermont, farm tours or experiences that allow the public to interact with livestock and agricultural processes can help visitors better understand where their food comes from. 
Big Picture Farm, a goat farm located in Townshend owned by Louisa Conrad and Lucas Farrell, is well-known for their goat caramels. Beyond producing sweet confections, they have started Goat Hangouts, which, yes, includes getting snuggles and giving pets.

“It’s really beautiful because I think a lot of people don’t get that ability to just touch a farm animal and really be with them as opposed to just sort of looking at them from the other side of the fence,” Conrad said. 
It is not only animals that visitors can see firsthand, but agricultural processes like sugaring for maple syrup. At Rooney Farm, the sugarhouse is open for visitors throughout the season to stop by and see where maple products come from for themselves. 
“One of the best things about agritourism is the education piece, because farmers are so passionate about what they do,” Rooney said. “I could talk to somebody about maple syrup for like two days straight. And I wouldn’t get tired of it because I’m so passionate about it.” 
The Rooney’s also offer overnights at Sunrise Hut, a quaint cabin located on their property available from April to October. Equipped with mountain views, a nearby swimming hole and recreation path, the cabin is perfect for the traveler that might want to experience a farm with some primitive privacy, explained Rooney. 
Another form of a farm stay that the Kennetts offer at Liberty Hill is more immersive. Visitors stay in the farmhouse with the family, eat their home cooked meal, and obtain a brief glimpse into the intimacy of Kennett life on their farm.
Beth Kennett believes that these experiences are transformative for families, especially those new to nature. Kennett still remembers a decade ago when three boys of different ages staying at the farm became friends.
They were all from urban areas and after dinner, had seemed to disappear. Being an attentive grandmother herself, Kennett went outside to investigate.
“We brought in hay that day, and it was sitting in the yard because nobody had time to get it unloaded on the elevator into the barn. They were lying on top of the hay bales staring up at the sky, watching for shooting stars,” Kennett said. The night sky, free of light pollution, was clear for miles, Kennett said.
“The dad called me up 10 years later just to make sure we were still taking guests because he said, you have no idea how magical that was,” Kennett said. “They’re like 17 and 27 [now] and they’re still talking about that night lying on the hay bales, looking at the sky.”

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Low-income Hoosiers are about to get a whole lot hungrier. 
At least, that’s the concern of state advocates and national researchers focused on combatting food insecurity after Congress decided to cut funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, earlier this month. 
“We anticipate that folks will start penny pinching and seeking alternate sources even before the cuts come online. But I think we’ll also see a lot of folks who just decide, ‘My gosh, you already made me do all this paperwork and it’s basically a pittance. I’m not making enough money at work; I don’t have time to jump through these hoops,’” said Mark Lynch, the director of advocacy at the Indy Hunger Network. “I think that’s our biggest fear: that hunger will increase for all of those reasons.”
How will the megabill impact Indiana’s budget? Hundreds of millions in federal dollars will be lost

The latest estimate projects that the federal government will save between $5.7 billion and $6 billion each year on SNAP, starting in fiscal year 2028 because it is shifting some costs to states. New work requirements for recipients, which start two years earlier, will trim federal spending by another $68.6 billion. 
That delayed impact will prolong uncertainty for the experts, but means that millions of enrollees won’t feel the brunt of the cuts until after the critical midterm elections — which some critics say is a political calculation to retain a Republican majority in Congress. However, it will take states some time to implement the new changes required under the federal budget bill. 
Some of the savings come from shifting the cost to states and penalizing states with error rates above 6% — which also includes underpayments. 
“I think a lot of people are very concerned about this because they’re putting states in a very difficult bind,” said Erica Kenney, an associate professor of public health nutrition at Harvard University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. 
“… Lowering the error rates to 6% means that you need to have some really stronger policies going on,” Kenney continued. “But then, at the same time, they’re going to cut the funding that states get from the federal government for the administrative agencies. So you’re giving these state agencies less resources to address the errors and then punishing them if the errors are too high.”
Kenney and fellow Harvard associate professor of public health, Cindy Leung, emphasized the importance of SNAP and shared their concerns about funding cuts. 
“I don’t think there is much out there if you don’t have SNAP. SNAP is irreplaceable. SNAP is the only nutrition assistance program that is under (the U.S. Department of Agriculture) that targets all Americans,” Leung said. “… SNAP has been the main line of defense against poverty and hunger for decades.”
Indiana has 588,184 SNAP beneficiaries across 281,112 households, as of April 2025.
 More about SNAP

Previous research indicates that SNAP reduces food insecurity by 30% — and has an even bigger impact on those with severe need, the Harvard experts shared. 
Other programs, such as the Women, Infant and Children program or free and reduced price lunches at schools, target specific populations. The latter, however, could also shrink if SNAP enrollment is reduced because local enrollment is used to funnel dollars into the program.
An estimated 38% of SNAP households work and simply don’t make enough to feed their families, said Leung. Those who don’t work include the elderly, those with disabilities and children. 
  Mark Lynch, Director of Advocacy with the Indy Hunger Network
Often, SNAP is used as a last resort because the paperwork poses a barrier, Leung said, and is used for just a few months during times of extreme poverty.
“… People only get SNAP if they’ve really exhausted their other resources — they don’t have any more money in their savings account, they don’t have family or friends that they can ask to borrow money, they can’t find other employment,” Leung said. “When we’ve talked to people on SNAP, we’ve heard continuously that SNAP is a lifesaver. That SNAP has helped them out when they were in their most dire situation.”
Having a well-fed community also reduces the prevalence of chronic disease and cognitive impairment for older adults. During the COVID-19 pandemic, states expanded their SNAP programming and reported drops in food insecurity — only to reverse those gains once eligibility and benefits tightened up again. 
  Erica Kenney, an associate professor with Harvard University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health
SNAP reduces healthy care expenditures and medical costs for participants — even reducing emergency room visits, Kenney added. By getting more and better access to food, pregnant mothers birth babies with higher birth weights, setting their children up for healthier lives. 
“Because of past historical events, I really worry about what health disparities and what food insecurity is going to look like in this country,” Leung said. 
Some states, like Texas, are already shifting their food insecurity programming in response to SNAP funding cuts. The Lone Star State opted out of a program that feeds families during the summer months because of the cost associated with federal funding uncertainty, according to the Texas Tribune. Cost also played a role in Indiana’s decision to withdraw from the program, also known as SUN Bucks, which deposited a small amount of money onto parents’ benefit cards. 
“The decision by the Braun administration not to do SUN Bucks was really the first time that money was taken out of pockets in a very real way,” said Lynch. “We saw families more engaged with summer feeding programs which — good on the state of Indiana — they expanded.” 
  Cindy Leung, an associate professor with Harvard University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health
Still, Lynch said one location outside of Marion County had a two-hour pickup line for summer meals. Fortunately, organizers had enough food but “that’s a pretty good example of what’s going to happen if, across the board, there are 15-20% SNAP cuts for Hoosiers.” 
Notably, SNAP doesn’t cover a participant’s full food budget, often covering between two to three weeks of food purchases. 
But advocates and researchers alike had concerns about whether non-SNAP programs could effectively close the gap in food insecurity left by cuts, Kenney said.
“SNAP is just really, really effective. The charitable food system is there (and) I think we’re going to see a lot more people relying more on the charitable food system — they’re going to have to,” Kenney said. “I’m sure we’re going to see a lot of very good-hearted, kind-hearted people stepping up and trying to volunteer and help their communities through the charitable food system. But I don’t think it’s going to be enough to counteract the cuts that we’re seeing.”
Indiana opted to keep state funding for food banks flat during the next biennium at $2 million, the rare budget line item that didn’t get slashed following a dismal revenue forecast. This week the Indiana State Department of Agriculture, led by Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith, announced how the $2 million would be disbursed to Indiana food banks.
 What about SNAP-Ed?

One portion of SNAP will be eliminated this September: the SNAP Education line item worth $536 million. 
Indiana’s $7.4 million portion is used to fund education programming like cooking classes, guides to budgeting and nutrition-dense recipes. 
But the biggest impact could be the loss of a statewide app known as Community Compass that maps out food pantries, stores accepting food benefits and more. First launched in Marion County, a statewide funding boost expanded the app’s boundaries to include all Hoosiers back in 2021. 
“All of that comes from SNAP-Ed dollars,” Lynch said. “… we have no idea where (more funding) is going to come from.” 
The Indiana Department of Health said it paid Indy Hunger Network $118,847.11 for the Community Compass for federal fiscal year 2025. Plans for the future of the app, however, are uncertain. 
Other SNAP-Ed programming, such as that provided by Purdue University’s Extension Service, will also be impacted, though it’s unclear how many staff could lose their positions.

Families First is partnering with statewide organizations to protest the cuts to Medicaid, SNAP and other programs on Saturday, July 26. Eight Indiana locations include: Greencastle, Salem, Merrillville, Mitchell, a Winchester to Richmond caravan, the St. Joseph County Courthouse, Fort Wayne and Terre Haute. 

Lynch highlighted other uses, including the Cooking Matters program that uses community kitchens at senior living facilities, jails, women’s shelters and apartment complexes to teach cooking skills and hand out groceries. 
“In a perfect world, Congress comes back … and maybe they’ll try to bring that (funding) back up in some type of other legislation,” said Lynch, citing some support for SNAP-Ed among Republicans. “… At this point, the law has been passed. And we’re going to see ramifications from that are going to be devastating to rural, urban and suburban families all throughout Indiana.”
When asked, Leung said she didn’t have a sense of how this aligned with the Make America Healthy Again agenda, as promoted by U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 
“It does seem very counterintuitive when you eliminate nutrition education funding … because people need to have the knowledge and the awareness as well as the accessibility to healthy foods in order to be healthy and live a healthy lifestyle,” Leung said. 
Lynch put it more plainly when speaking about the movement on a state level. 
“You’re talking about Making Indiana Healthy Again and, boy, losing those SNAP-Ed dollars is not going to make that happen.”
Kenney noted that SNAP-Ed planning resources are also available to everybody, regardless of whether or not they have federal funding. 
“I’m just really worried. I’m worried about what’s going to happen to a lot of households — worried about kids, in particular, but households in general,” summarized Kenney. “This is the largest cut SNAP has ever seen in its history…”
“I think SNAP is undergoing some historically unprecedented changes,” added Leung. “… This is going to have ramifications long past the current administration.”

She was nearly 18 weeks pregnant. Her water had broken, and her pregnancy was no longer viable. Her condition was deteriorating. Doctors knew she needed emergency care. Instead of treating her, they called lawyers.
She was turned away from two hospitals in Missouri and a third in Kansas before finally receiving care in Illinois. By then, she was nearly fully dilated and at serious risk of life-threatening infection. Federal investigators later cited the Missouri hospitals for violating EMTALA, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, which requires hospitals to stabilize patients with emergency conditions.
EMTALA mandates emergency care. Missouri law created hesitation. In the gap between them, patients suffered.
Although federal law requires treatment regardless of state abortion bans, Missouri’s laws caused so much legal confusion that even a bleeding, unstable patient was denied timely care. In 2023, investigators issued deficiency findings against the hospitals that turned Farmer away. If uncorrected, these violations can lead to the loss of Medicare and Medicaid funding.
This was not a failure of medical judgment. It was the result of a legal system that forced doctors to choose between providing necessary care and risking their medical license.
Missouri’s abortion ban, passed in 2022, only allows the procedure is when it is necessary to preserve the life of the pregnant patient. But the law offers no clinical criteria, no mention of infection or hemorrhage and no process for documenting good-faith decisions. Vagueness became its own deterrent.
A Jackson County judge blocked Missouri’s abortion ban earlier this year, finding it conflicted with the constitutional right to reproductive freedom that was approved by voters in November 2024.
The judge’s decision made the many abortion restrictions temporarily unenforceable and upheld both constitutional rights and the will of the people. It was a decisive act of judicial leadership at a moment when state agencies remained silent.
But the state’s abortion restrictions remain on the books, and Missouri Attorney General Andre Bailey has appealed to reinstate them. The state has issued no updated guidance, leaving hospitals unsure and doctors legally exposed. Until this legal battle is resolved, providers face ongoing confusion and risk, putting patients in jeopardy.
While abortions can now legally resume in Missouri, the lack of clear state guidance keeps hospitals and doctors uncertain, further endangering patient care.
Supporters of the law have argued that discretion gives doctors room to act. But in practice, uncertainty causes delay. A rupturing ectopic pregnancy or a septic miscarriage clearly qualifies as an emergency under federal law. Missouri law did not define these conditions as emergencies. Without that protection, doctors hesitate.
A 2023 survey by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine found that over 60% of OB-GYNs in abortion-ban states delayed care due to legal fear. The same survey documented more than 100 cases where pregnant patients in medical emergencies were denied or delayed treatment.
Missouri has released no data on how abortion laws affect emergency care. Its infant mortality rate remains among the highest in the country.
Nearly 42% of Missouri counties lack adequate maternity care, including OB-GYN coverage. These are warning signs of a healthcare system already in distress. Instead of stabilizing it, state law has undermined access to essential reproductive services.
Missouri’s reproductive laws have long reflected state control over patient autonomy.
From 1913 through the 1960s, the state authorized forced sterilizations in state-run institutions, disproportionately targeting Missourians who were poor, disabled or Black. That history casts a long shadow. Today, Black women in Missouri are more than twice as likely as white women to die from pregnancy-related causes, a disparity that reflects ongoing inequities in access, trust, and care.
Clinical judgment breaks down when every decision carries legal risk. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has warned that abortion bans are preventing doctors from delivering basic care and causing deep moral injury. Missouri’s own Department of Health has reported ongoing maternal health provider shortages, especially in rural areas.
Even with the abortion ban currently blocked, the state has done nothing to clarify emergency standards, protect physicians, or align its laws with federal requirements.
Young people are especially vulnerable. Missouri’s legal confusion adds to every barrier teens already face. Most adolescents are less likely to recognize a pregnancy early, and many lack access to comprehensive sex education. With parental consent laws and few resources for confidential care, they are left to navigate vague restrictions without clarity, privacy, or support.
These risks are real: two-thirds of U.S. teen girls now live under abortion restrictions.
Like Mylissa Farmer, even lawmakers face delays under abortion restrictions.
In 2024, U.S. Rep. Kat Cammack of Florida experienced a rupturing ectopic pregnancy. Her treatment was delayed while hospital legal teams reviewed the state’s abortion ban. She later said she had to look up the law herself and call the governor’s office to get care.
In Texas, Amanda Zurawski developed sepsis after her water broke prematurely. Doctors delayed her care while awaiting legal clearance. Both women faced life-threatening emergencies. Only one had the political access needed for timely emergency reproductive care.
Other states have done more to prevent delays. Colorado defines a medical emergency as any condition that risks serious or permanent harm. New Mexico protects doctors acting in good faith from criminal prosecution. Utah courts have blocked parts of that state’s abortion ban due to vagueness. Even Texas has issued guidance enforcing EMTALA.
Missouri has done none of these things.
The state law that forced Mylissa Farmer to cross state lines for care may be blocked, but the legal fear it created still deters care when it is needed most. Hospitals operate without clear standards. Doctors remain unprotected. Nothing prevents this from happening again.
In 2026, Missouri voters may face another ballot initiative that could reshape abortion access once more. But constitutional rights mean little when hospitals lack clear instruction and providers fear prosecution.
Missouri must act. Define medical emergencies. Protect physicians who follow federal law. Align the statute with EMTALA. Emergency rooms are not courtrooms. The next patient should not need a lawyer or a six-hour drive to survive.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Abortion-Arizona-3-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-07-25 07:56:24.525544

“I look forward to complying with the ruling handed down today,” Scott said shortly after Thursday’s hearing. “The Public Disclosure Commission does important work to ensure transparency in our elections. People have a right to know who’s funding campaigns for public office.”
Because Scott didn’t dispute the allegations outlined in an 11-page stipulation, Thursday’s hearing focused on the amount of the civil penalty.
The commission’s compliance officer, Tanya Mercier, recommended a $30,000 fine for the committee, citing “a pattern of noncompliance” evidenced by the prolific number of errant reports. She said she did not think the committee acted with intention, but it also did not make a “good faith effort” to follow the law. She recommended a $1,000 fine for the haircut violation.
Scott established the campaign committee, the Fighting 43rd, in March 2024. He raised $147,304 and spent most of it en route to winning a two-year term representing Seattle’s 43rd Legislative District.
Throughout the campaign, he filed late and incomplete reports of money raised and spent.
In the primary, expenditures on printed campaign materials and political advertising were either not reported on time or “were missing required details meant to inform the public about the Committee’s advertising activities,” according to the stipulation. Many of the inaccurate filings did not get corrected until earlier this year.
Scott told the commission his first treasurer was inexperienced and left mid-campaign. A professional firm, Argo Strategies, came on board days before the November 2024 election, he said. 
Commission staff also found Scott’s campaign committee wrongly identified the sponsor of two mailers sent out in the general election as “Better Washington” instead of “The Fighting 43rd.”
And Scott’s multiple visits to a Seattle barber shop in the primary violated the state’s prohibition on such use of campaign funds.
Asked about that violation, Scott said candidates are expected to make a lot of appearances and he’s now “a little more educated” on the permissible uses of campaign funds.
Commissioners made clear they felt Scott had really messed up. But they acknowledged the challenges of being a first-time legislative candidate without an experienced treasurer.
Scott argued a $30,000 fine was excessive and pointed out the commission had recently levied lesser fines on the state Republican Party, Let’s Go Washington and Service Employees International Union Healthcare 1199NW for reporting lapses that involved larger sums.
Commissioner Jim Oswald said he was “seriously surprised” to see such a large penalty recommended in light of those decisions involving organizations with more resources.
“Frankly, this would be an overreaction. These are serious violations,” he said. But it didn’t appear Scott was purposefully flouting the law, he said.
Commission chair J. Robert Leach had reservations, too, saying what occurred “doesn’t rise to the level of some of what we’ve dealt with in the past.”
“I don’t think we want to make him the headline of the year for the PDC,” Leach said. “I think Mr. Scott made the wrong decisions. I think he understands how he got there. Please comply in the future.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1586-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-25 07:56:24.525544

(Getty Images)Hoosier kids shouldn’t be in orientation and buying school clothes in late July. Alas, children will soon be back in the classrooms instead of finishing out a nice summer.
Fair warning: I am entering grumpy, boomer territory. But it’s not just my age. Even the younger members of the Indiana Capital Chronicle believe this has gotten out of control.
“September is how the Lord (and the harvest) intended,” a reporter quipped during a Slack conversation this week.
Indeed, all of us remembered starting the academic year around Labor Day, and we grew up across at least six different states.
In 2009, parents pushed the Indiana General Assembly to require a uniform start date, or at least one that was after Labor Day. There were hearings, but ultimately, local control was retained.
The decision is left to individual districts. The Metropolitan School District of Warren Township in Indianapolis started Thursday, for instance. Many others are set to return July 30, July 31 or Aug. 1.

An IndyStar listing covering more than 30 central Indiana districts or schools had Aug. 14 as the latest start date — but that was just one Catholic high school.
The creep toward earlier starts began when educators saw learning loss from the long summer. And thus began the balanced calendar.
But as far as I can tell from recent scores, students aren’t doing any better in recent decades than they were before.
Schools also say it’s necessary to meet the state’s 180-day instructional requirement.
One parent at a 2009 legislative hearing counted the weekdays between the fourth Monday in August and the end of May, showing plenty of days available to meet the requirement without infringing on summer.
“Summertime is a magical time in a child’s life,” he testified. “Three months of fun. No responsibility.”
Instead, schools have largely redistributed time out of the classroom, adding weeklong fall breaks, additional days in December and other small breaks.
Others have argued that utility costs are higher in August, and that kids going back early impacts tourism activities that rely on youth workers.
It’s not just Indiana, though. Pew Research Center found in a 2023 analysis that some students start in late July, with many back by mid-August.
There are differences across geographic regions. Schools tends to start earlier in southern regions than farther north, broadly speaking.
Here is what Pew found:

More than two-thirds of students in the U.S. Census Bureau’s East South Central division (Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi and Tennessee) went back to school the week of Aug. 7. They joined another 19% of students who had started classes earlier.
In the West South Central division (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas), 94% of students returned to school between Aug. 7 and Aug. 18.
But in the six New England states, almost no one goes back to school before the week of Aug. 28.
And students in the Middle Atlantic states (New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania) go back even later. About three-quarters won’t hit the books until after Labor Day, which falls on Sept. 4 this year.

Indiana falls into the East North Central region, with the majority starting in mid-August.
I think it’s time to re-evaluate the school calendars with an eye toward starting later.
Some of my concern is absolutely nostalgia. But I also don’t think the shift has netted students and parents anything of value.

Under a directive from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and the Trump administration, the National Park Service has removed an exhibit at Muir Woods National Monument that aimed to tell a more comprehensive history of the site. The exhibit was installed in 2021 and amended to highlight previously untold narratives of the Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo peoples who stewarded the land for hundreds of years, and the efforts by the California Club, a women’s organization, to save the forest in the early 20th century. Muir Woods is the first National Park to remove an exhibit after President Donald Trump issued an executive order, called “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” to eliminate a “distorted narrative” that the President says was being spread through the national parks, monuments and other federal institutions in the United States. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)A Minnesota-grown effort to archive national park signs has collected more than 1,000 crowdsourced images after President Trump ordered the removal of content that “disparage[s] Americans” or includes “improper partisan ideology.” 
Save Our Signs was created by librarians, historians and data experts at the University of Minnesota. The project calls on people to visit national parks and upload photos of signs to preserve the information before it can be taken down. 
Molly Blake, a social sciences librarian at UMN, is one of the co-founders of the project. She described the national park system as “the nation’s largest outdoor history classroom.” 
“One thing that I think is especially important is that this information is very deliberately accessible to everyone, and it’s taxpayer funded,” Blake said in an interview with the Reformer. “That made me feel very strongly that this should be preserved somewhere so that people can see it.” 
Save Our Signs is working with the Data Rescue Project, an organization that preserves government data sources it considers at risk under the Trump administration. 
In an executive order issued in March, Trump directed Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum to find and remove public monuments, memorials and signs that “inappropriately disparage Americans,” stating that these installations should “focus on the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people.” 
In response to the order, Burgum directed land management bureaus like the National Park Service to display signs asking the public to report content that meets the criteria of Trump’s order. The effort has not been entirely successful; some visitors are submitting comments asking the parks to cover more of the country’s actual — as opposed to an idealized, fictional — past. 
If carried out in full, the order would shield visitors from the truth about a range of historical subjects, including slavery, Jim Crow, Native genocide, environmental degradation and climate change. Indeed, The New York Times reported this week that several signs are under review, and many of them relate to slavery and the Civil Rights Movement. Other topics include the government’s treatment of Native Americans and the impacts of climate change. 
At least one sign has been altered — an exhibit at Muir Woods National Monument. Rangers there created it to lend historical context to an existing sign in the park. The additions included information about the Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo people who had originally inhabited the land, as well as information about John Muir — the park’s namesake — who used racist language to describe Native Americans. Pictures from the exhibit are now featured on Save Our Signs’s website. 
Although signs on other public lands are also affected by the executive order, the archiving effort is focused on national parks because of their unique responsibility to preserve sites’ history. 
“These sites have been really, really carefully curated to tell a complete and complex story of U.S. history. So you have sites that describe moments of progress, places that were really central to the Civil Rights Movement and the abolitionist movement, for example. And then you also have sites that tell really painful parts of American history, including slavery, including the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II,” Blake said. “And all of those stories are really important to preserve.”
Save Our Signs plans to publish the data it collects by October 13.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2226854074.jpg,,,2025-07-25 07:56:24.525544

(Photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)The board overseeing implementation of the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future recommended Thursday that it work with the state Department of Education to develop a “clear” strategy to address the delayed implementation of teacher collaborative time, which became a battleground in the 2025 General Assembly.
It was one of dozens of proposals unanimously approved by the Accountability and Implementation Board Thursday as it continues to fine-tune the Blueprint, now heading into its fourth year. The board has until Aug. 1 each year to make updates to the document that serves as a guide for state agencies, all 24 school systems and other stakeholders to follow and help implement the statewide plan.
The board also suggested that 27 recommendations from a Blueprint special education work group be included in the multibillion-dollar education reform plan.
The majority of changes reviewed Thursday focused on the plan’s second pillar, or priority, that deals with high quality and diverse teachers and school leaders. Several revisions to the comprehensive plan were adoptions of policies that had been approved this year by legislators.
One deals with the creation of a national teacher recruitment campaign and calls for consultation with a nonprofit organization with expertise in working with state education agencies. The $2 million campaign, scheduled to run through June 2029, is part of the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act signed into law in May.
The act also includes a teacher relocation incentive grant, offering up to $2,000 to out-of-state licensed teachers to as an inducement to move to Maryland, to both ease the current teacher shortage but also cut into the 6,000 conditionally licensed teachers in the state. The department will establish processes and procedures to accept applications and award grants to school systems starting around Oct. 1.
Higher ed commission warned of ‘sea change’ to Pell Grant eligibility, student visas

The board received nearly six dozen responses from Blueprint advisory committees and the public on other recommendations to the comprehensive plan.
Several comments focused on ways to improve communication and outreach to the public with updates on the Blueprint plan. The board plans to create materials geared for educators, parents and students and make them available in different languages besides English.
Although it is specifically part of the Blueprint plan, AIB Executive Director Rachel Hise said the board will continue to “respect” local collective bargaining agreements done by each school system. That reflected a recommendation made by Mary Pat Fannon, executive director of the Public School Superintendents’ Association of Maryland.
“Each district has unique staffing and budget constraints, constraints preserving local autonomy and bargaining is essential, and state level involvement or public commentary on local agreements should be minimized,” Fannon wrote.
On Thursday, Fannon spoke virtually before the board and offered a “thank you” on updating the plan with recommendations from the association.
Other revisions and updates to the Blueprint comprehensive plan include:

Getting the department to convene a work group to assess the current mixed-delivery system on full-day prekindergarten, to determine why some private providers have declined to participate in the publicly funded program, among other goals.
Getting the department to award grants for local school systems that collaborate with colleges and universities for prospective teachers. The money would include books, tuition and fees for teacher candidates, stipends for mentor teachers and administrative costs of the program.
Posting Blueprint data on the AIB website via data dashboards by Dec. 1 and updating it when information becomes available.

The board does not have an August meeting scheduled, but could have two or three new members when the seven-member body reconvenes Sept. 18.
Current board member Joseph Manko is one of six candidates sent to Gov. Wes Moore (D) last week to fill three open seats on the board. The governor has up to 30 days to choose three individuals for the board openings.
Although Manko’s term expired July 1, a board spokesperson said an email that board counsel said he can continue to “serve until a successor is appointed and qualifies to serve.”

(Photo Courtesy of Ballah)Maryland and 24 other states have expanded their lawsuit against Trump administration attempts to dismantle AmeriCorps, adding the Office of Management and Budget for “unlawfully” withholding more than $38 million from the program.
The action came after U.S. District Judge Deborah L. Boardman in June ordered the Trump administration to restore AmeriCorps programs and workers that it had ended without notice in April, and to restore nearly $400 million in federal grants that were canceled.
Since then, however, OMB has “significantly undermined service delivery by withholding, delaying, or improperly conditioning funds intended for Plaintiff States’ Service Commissions and AmeriCorps. programs.” The amended lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court of Maryland, adds OMB and its director, Russell Vought, as defendants in the suit, which originally named the Corporation for National and Community Service, operating as AmeriCorps, and its interim head, Jennifer Bastress Tahmasebi.
The suit cited AmeriCorps programs like Salisbury University’s ShoreCorps,  the largest AmeriCorps program in the state. ShoreCorps had 178 members enrolled from August 2024 to August of this year, who had delivered 53,000 service hours through April at 57 government and nonprofit organizations around the Eastern Shore.

But the Salisbury program was still marked “not funded” for fiscal 2025, according to amended complaint.
“Despite an order to restore funding to critical AmeriCorps programs that serve Maryland’s most vulnerable, the Trump administration is withholding tens of millions of dollars intended for programs that educate our children, care for our elderly, and feed our families,” said Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown, who serves as co-lead of the suit.
“We will not allow the President to sidestep a court order and jeopardize programs Marylanders depend on and threaten the efforts of volunteers whose service uplifts families who struggle to make ends meet,” Brown said in a press release.
A White House spokesperson said last month AmeriCorps failed eight consecutive audits and made more than $45 million in improper payments last year.But the state’s suit claims that since President Donald Trump’s inauguration, his administration “has engaged in unprecedented efforts to unilaterally terminate federal programs, spending, and personnel without Congressional approval.”
Besides Maryland, the 24 other jurisdictions on the suit are the District of Columbia, and the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_6968-cropped-e1746485657221-1024x771.jpeg,,,2025-07-25 07:56:24.525544

“It really has been a true lifeline for the entire family,” Young said in a press call Thursday. “We have tried to provide care for my sister, and her needs are so demanding, so extreme, that a family by itself can’t manage to make this work. We need help, we need support, we’ve thrown ourselves into this to the extent that we can, but many, many other families are in similar situations.”
Young said that when Medicaid cuts hit Colorado in the past, the state could no longer provide residential care for his sister. She went through 20 different residential facilities in a span of 18 months, all of which were “inadequate” because they did not have proper funding, he said.
“Often, she was ejected from a placement because she overwhelmed the providers, sometimes without even a phone call,” Young said.
Young was one of the financial officials from five Democratic-led states, including Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman, on a call Thursday hosted by Americans for Responsible Growth, a national advocacy group that works with state financial leaders. They warned about how Republicans’ recent passage of their “One Big, Beautiful Bill” will harm Medicaid and Medicare recipients ahead of the 60th anniversary of the programs.
The law cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, a state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes.
Dave Wallack, executive director of Americans for Responsible Growth, said that since President Donald Trump took office, Republicans have “systematically gutted health care programs, fired thousands of federal workers, and slashed more than a trillion dollars for Medicaid, the largest cut in the program’s history.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Wallack said the cuts will lead to 17 million Americans losing health care coverage and more than 50,000 preventable deaths annually. Young said in Colorado, more than 375,000 recipients could lose Medicaid coverage. Democratic officials from New Mexico, Illinois, Minnesota and Maryland all said that rural communities in their states will be hit hardest by the cuts, and they will feel the effects first.
Rural hospitals at risk
Lierman said 42% of Maryland’s population is supported by Medicaid or Medicare. She said the two programs were designed to take care of “vulnerable Americans” who would be “sicker and worse off” without the coverage they provide.
“These programs are economic powerhouses that drive prosperity in our communities and strengthen our state’s fiscal foundation,” Lierman said. “Cutting Medicaid is both fiscally reckless and morally bankrupt, abandoning our most vulnerable residents, including our seniors and people with disabilities, while destroying the economic foundation that so many of our communities depend on.”
New Mexico Treasurer Laura Montoya said her state is the No. 1 recipient state for Medicaid in the nation, and 80% of the babies born in New Mexico are born into Medicaid. She said the federal law’s changes to Medicaid will “force hospitals and clinics to either raise premiums or copays or shut down entirely,” and 15 hospitals in rural communities are already at risk of closing their doors.
“Our state’s entire provider network depends on the state’s current Medicaid coverage landscape,” Montoya said. “These cuts will increase health care costs for all New Mexicans regardless of Medicaid enrollment, not to mention more uninsured individuals could end up skipping preventative care leading to worsened health outcomes, higher cost for emergency care, and more crowded emergency rooms and urgent care facilities, placing even more strain on an already overwhelmed system.”
The shift of responsibility for states to fund Medicaid could also destabilize New Mexico’s entire support network, including housing assistance, early childhood education, public safety and economic development, Montoya said. The New Mexico Legislature passed a measure creating a Medicaid trust fund to safeguard services amid federal cuts, she added.
Illinois Treasurer Michael Frerichs said 44% of the Medicaid recipients in his state are children, 9% are seniors, and 7% are adults with disabilities. Nine rural hospitals in Illinois, all in Republican districts, are at risk of closing because of funding cuts, he said.
Federal job losses jumped to 12,700 in Maryland, most of any state

“When hospitals close and health care providers cut back, people lose their jobs. They lose their income, and their health insurance,” Frerichs said. “Illinois’ economy will be destabilized. The cruel, inhumane Trump big, bad budget bill will wreak havoc across Illinois for years to come.”
Julie Blaha, Minnesota’s state auditor, said about 25% of Minnesotans are enrolled in the state’s Medicaid program, which also supports 30% of births. For Black and Indigenous communities, those numbers are even higher: The state’s medical assistance program covers 80% of Black babies born in the state and 90% of Indigenous babies.
Blaha said it is more cost-efficient to keep people on these health care programs in a stable place, as it’s more expensive “to pull somebody up who’s fallen through.”
“It is time to stand up and tell Congress and tell Trump to roll back these terrible cuts and try to stop the avalanche before it crushes us all,” Blaha said.
‘Among the greatest policy achievements’
Health care is a “major economic driver” in Colorado, Young said, as hospitals employ about 1 in 5 Colorado residents and generate $1 billion in tax revenue yearly. Reduced federal investment in health care will lead to clinic closures and reduced tax revenue that will affect quality of life for “Coloradans of every age and income bracket,” he said.
“Colorado cannot afford to downsize our health care sector,” Young said. “We’re already facing dire workforce and health care shortages, especially in rural and frontier communities. The state can’t make up for these losses either.”
Medicaid and Medicare are “among the greatest policy achievements in American history,” Young said, as the programs strengthen health care systems and lift people out of poverty. He said the programs can be strengthened while saving money, but “this slash and burn technique” will be “devastating.”
“When people get the care they need, they hold down jobs, they provide for their families and avoid catastrophic medical debt,” Young said.

Micah Beckwith's office, located inside the statehouse, appeared closed and vacant on July 11, 2025. (Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith’s statehouse office has been repeatedly closed during public business hours in recent weeks — at times with no signage posted and no staff inside — even as Gov. Mike Braun has ordered a broad return to in-person work for state employees.
The Indiana Capital Chronicle visited the lieutenant governor’s office six times between late June and mid-July and found it dark or locked on four occasions. Three of the closures — June 20, June 27 and July 11 — fell on Fridays.
Internal office communications obtained by the Capital Chronicle appeared to show staff were allowed to work remotely on some of those days.
One June 20 message, for example, indicated that, “Due to the LG travel schedule – the office will be closed and everyone may work from home. Please update your calendars accordingly.”
Jim Kehoe, a spokesperson for the lieutenant governor’s office, told the Capital Chronicle June 30 that the office “just happened to be closed on those days because of staffing.”

“It was really just coincidence that it happened two Fridays in a row,” he said. “I do not anticipate that happening again, and if it does it will be the exception.”
But nearly two weeks later, on July 11, another Friday, the Capital Chronicle again found the office locked, with no lights on and no staff inside.
The office was open on July 18, with at least one staffer visibly present.
The lieutenant governor’s office was also closed on July 3, a Thursday, for what staff described as an “office field trip” to a farm in Noblesville. A sign posted that day read, “Sorry we missed you! Our team is currently unavailable due to an all-staff meeting. Please scan here if you would like to schedule an appointment.”
In a message to staff that week, office leadership advised that “if you aren’t joining us at the farm – work from home cuz the office will be closed.”
In a follow-up email to the Capital Chronicle, Kehoe said the office’s approach was consistent with the governor’s direction: “Our work from home policy complies with Governor Braun’s executive order.”
The state transparency portal shows the Lieutenant Governor’s office has 39 employees split between offices in the Statehouse and an adjacent office building.
Beckwith debates Hoosiers in chippy town hall

Asked about the closures, Braun reaffirmed his push to get employees back to their offices.
“Unless there’s a good reason for that, where it may make no difference … to really get things done, you’ve got to collaborate,” Braun said Thursday. “And I saw so many instances and some actual recordings I heard of folks working from home that would have been confusing even to see which day they were answering the phone.”
He added that there are a few jobs where remote work makes sense but said “most of them, you need to be together to collaborate. You’re already paying the expenses — the leases and the buildings and the upkeep. Why not? Doesn’t make sense.”
Braun’s back-to-work executive order, issued Jan. 14, called for a sweeping end to hybrid work arrangements and emphasized a return to daily in-person staffing across all state agencies. 
The policy, which took full effect July 1, specifically instructed agency heads to eliminate regular remote work on Fridays and to ensure the public has full access to services during standard business hours.
The order applies to all executive-branch employees, including staff in the lieutenant governor’s office, unless exempted for operational reasons.
“When it comes to other state office holders, they’re independent,” Braun said. “I’ve been very clear: I want to get things done and focus on kitchen table issues.”

In a letter sent this week that arrived at the prosecutor’s office Thursday, Russell Beckman, a retired Kenosha Police Department detective, has asked the DA, Xavier Solis, to meet with Beckman and Bell’s father, Michael M. Bell.
Beckman has been working with the elder Bell for more than a decade to analyze the events on the night of the fatal shooting and challenge the official police account of the incident.
Their research has turned up “credible and well documented issues with the integrity of the investigation,” Beckman wrote. “There are multiple indications of a cover up of the true circumstances of the death by high level Kenosha police and government officials.”
The letter comes after a change in the administration in the DA’s office, and after years of conflict that Bell and Beckman have had with the previous DA, Michael Graveley.
After Graveley opposed an independent investigation of the case — and made claims about some of the evidence that Bell and Beckman disputed — they unsuccessfully sought legal sanctions against Graveley through the state Office of Lawyer Regulation.
Graveley, who served as DA for two terms, did not run for reelection in November 2024. His successor on the Democratic ticket, Carli McNeill, a veteran prosecutor in the DA’s office, lost to Solis, who ran as a Republican.
Michael E. Bell was fatally shot during a confrontation with police in the driveway of the home where he was living on Nov. 9, 2004. A Kenosha Police Department internal investigation exonerated all the officers involved within two days.
Officer Albert Gonzales shot the younger Bell at point-blank range after another officer at the scene shouted that he believed Bell had grabbed his gun.
The elder Bell sued the city, ultimately winning a settlement of $1.75 million in 2010. He subsequently campaigned for a state law requiring that police hand over investigations of deaths in their custody to another agency. The law was enacted in 2014.
Since the settlement of his lawsuit, Bell, with the assistance of Beckman and various technical consultants, has highlighted eyewitness testimony as well as physical evidence that contradict key details in the police department’s account of the events.
Because of those discrepancies, Bell and Beckman contend that the officer who thought his gun had been grabbed was mistaken, and that Gonzales was in a position to realize as much but fired his gun too hastily.
Gonzales, who ran unsuccessfully for sheriff in 2022 and has self-published his own account of the incident, has stood by the official police account.
In his letter to Solis, Beckman wrote, “I feel compelled to state that it is my belief that the actual shooting death of Mr. Bell’s son was legally justified, despite my concerns that it was not necessary.”
Nevertheless, Beckman charged in the letter, Kenosha police and city officials were responsible for “criminal acts committed to conceal the true circumstances of the death. I submit that this cover up started immediately after the shooting and continues to this day.”
Along with the letter, Beckman submitted a 95-page document outlining discrepancies and details that he and Bell have compiled to support their argument against the Kenosha Police Department description of the shooting and their claims of a willful coverup.
One discrepancy that Bell and Beckman found involves where various officers were standing during the confrontation in which Bell’s son was shot.
While the Kenosha Police account placed Gonzales on Bell’s son’s left side, with his gun pointing away from the house, eyewitness testimony and the medical examiner’s report indicated that Gonzales was on the young man’s right side, and his gun pointed toward the house.
That is a key difference that could demonstrate that the other officer who thought his gun was being taken was mistaken, Bell and Beckman contend.
“My son was being accused of trying to violently disarm an officer, and that he was the cause of his own death, according to the Kenosha PD,” Bell said Thursday.
“And that’s not the case. It was an accident,” he added, referring to the shooting. “But instead of coming back and saying it was an accident, they lied about it, and they discredit my son, and they discredit our family, and they discredited the law enforcement system. And so those things are really important to me.”
After Bell retrieved a sample of siding from the house several years later that included an indentation possibly from a bullet, he repeatedly sought the fatal bullet from the city of Kenosha, hoping to compare it to the indentation and support his and Beckman’s scenario of the incident.
As part of that campaign, Bell offered to donate $200,000 to charity and to indemnify the city in return for the bullet. City officials repeatedly rejected his appeal.
This past November, according to Bell and Beckman, they obtained records showing that an officer had signed out the bullet from the evidence material in 2007.
The officer did not document his reasons for doing so and did not disclose he had done so during a deposition in Bell’s lawsuit against the city that was underway at the time, they state in the appendix to the letter to Solis.  
“That’s really a new finding,” Bell told the Wisconsin Examiner, raising additional questions about the police handling of the incident.
The Wisconsin Examiner contacted Solis by email and left a voicemail message Thursday seeking comment on his initial reaction to the letter. The DA has not yet responded.
Bell has begun working with a documentary filmmaker interested in producing a film about his case. He posted a promotional video for the project on Facebook Thursday and later on YouTube as well.

(Laura Guido/Idaho Capital Sun)Lifelong Boise resident Susan Hudson, 72, lately has felt the American values and freedoms she and her parents have worked toward are eroding. 
“I’ve been worried and upset, and kind of obsessed with the way things are going in our country,” Hudson said. 
In an effort to follow her mother’s World War II-era advice to “do your bit,” she sought out the national nonprofit advocacy group Workers Circle. The group was founded 125 years ago by Jewish Eastern European immigrants to the U.S., “fleeing autocracy and persecution and seeking democratic freedoms and economic opportunities,” according to its website. 

Democracy Circle

Information about Democracy Circles can be found at circle.org/democracycircles 
To inquire about starting one, fill out the group’s online form.



In 2021 and 2022, the group was in the process of trying to push the administration under then-President Joe Biden to do more to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, a bill that would create a new formula for determining which states and localities had a pattern of voting discrimination, provide federal government oversight to prevent discrimination, and require public disclosure of voting changes 180 days before an election. 
The bill narrowly passed the U.S. House in 2021 but stalled in the U.S. Senate. 
Noelle Damico, director of social justice at Workers Circle, said that once the act died, she and other demonstrators from the organization brainstormed on the train ride home about what they could do next. A college student suggested a network of small local groups who could work in tandem across the country to continue advocating for changes. 
“It’s a very simple premise,” Damico said in a phone interview. “It’s that you bring together groups of people you know, people to whom you are connected, people who care about our democracy … essentially it uses the power of people’s relationships.”  
In 2023, the Democracy Circle model officially formed, and people in any state could connect with Workers Circle to get tools and training for organizing their own local group, Damico said. 
Hudson reached out in late December and launched her small Democracy Circle in January. She had been an adjunct professor at the Boise State University writing department for years, and said she enjoyed working in small groups. 
In convening her own circle, Hudson tried to reach people she knew close to her age as well as younger people to create a “crosscurrent” of experiences. There are around five to six people actively engaged in her small group, and they try to connect with other people in the community and other groups.

 Boise Democracy Circle focuses on voting rights, immigration 

A major focus of the group had been to oppose the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility, or SAVE, Act. The bill creates new documentation requirements to prove citizenship for voting and registering to vote in federal elections. 
Some voting advocates have voiced concern that it would disenfranchise voters who are eligible but don’t have the required documents, such as those without a passport or women whose married name doesn’t match their documents. 
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane advocated for the bill during a Subcommittee on Elections Hearing in April in Washington, D.C., the Idaho Press reported. 
Hudson’s group in June tabled outside the Boise Public Library Collister branch to provide handouts with information about the act and encourage people to contact their elected officials. 
However, the members didn’t give much of their “schpiel,” Hudson said, as many people approached them to talk about their own experiences or feelings about the state of democracy. 
“Listening is what we ended up doing there,” Hudson said. “Almost everyone who wanted to talk with us in any detail just unloaded their frustration, and in a couple of cases, their outright despair.” 
The group had brought along a list of addresses of local elected officials – from the Boise mayor to the Idaho congressional delegation – and postcards, and encouraged people with frustrations to make them known to their representatives. 
Hudson’s group meets once a month, usually by Zoom, and has also participated in protests, written post cards and made phone calls to elected officials. Part of the issue for Hudson is a nationwide increase in divisiveness and vitriol. She believes the model helps build community to counter that. 
“You just work person-to-person, and then there’s maybe some hope that we’ll get a critical mass, and something can happen,” she said. 
The next issue they’ve set their sights on is the mass deportations taking place. 
Through Workers Circle’s “Talk to Your Sheriff” initiative, the local group is hoping to meet with Ada County Sheriff Matt Clifford and discuss the level of coordination and action taken with the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
Idaho law enforcement agencies, under an executive order by Gov. Brad Little and a new state law, are required to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. A federal judge blocked some of the state immigration enforcement law, House Bill 83, from being enforced in an injunction while the constitutionality of the law is challenged in court, but allowed the portion of the legislation that requires cooperation to go into effect, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
Hudson said she, or whomever is sent as a representative for the group, plans to listen and learn to the sheriff’s perspective and hear what the Ada County Sheriff’s Office is doing. She has also reached out to local faith leaders to hear their concerns and gather questions they want answered. 
She said her desire to organize the group and engage in advocacy is strongly rooted in her family. Her mother grew up in a Republican household in Moscow, Idaho, and her father came from the Midwest. Both their families were devastated by the Great Depression. 
Her mother was a Government Girl — women who filled administrative positions in defense and other government agencies — in Washington, D.C., and her father was a New Deal statistician. 
“They looked at that as kind of a duty,” she said of service. 
And she is also motivated by her role as a parent. 
“You’re always a parent, even when your kids are grown up,” she said. “And I just feel like this is an opportunity for me, using democratic means and democratic processes to try not to leave the world such a mess for the next generation.”

In 2024, Banner Wyoming Medical Center met the majority of its 17 contractual covenants — such as maintaining essential services and adding new technologies. It fell short in four areas.
The post Wyoming’s biggest hospital gets mixed performance review following ownership transition appeared first on WyoFile .","When Natrona Collective Health Trust hired a consultant this spring to assess Banner Health’s management of Wyoming Medical Center, the aim was to clarify conflicting narratives swirling around Wyoming’s biggest hospital and judge if Banner is meeting certain obligations. 
Critics had maintained that since Banner purchased Wyoming Medical Center, management had allowed unacceptable and dangerous slips in the quality of care for patients. Hospital administration and others, meanwhile, contended Banner had provided crucial resources to sustain care through the pandemic and beyond. 
The Natrona Collective Health Trust, a private health foundation that was founded to support the needs of the Casper hospital, commissioned consultant PYA to assess the scenario. In the newly released assessment, PYA found that in 2024, Banner met the majority of its 17 contractual covenants — such as maintaining essential services and adding new technologies. The same report found Banner lacking in four areas, including commitment to safety and patient satisfaction. 
Though generally pleased with the report, Banner Health and Natrona Collective Health Trust representatives have vowed to address the areas that have gone unmet. (Natrona Collective Health Trust is a financial supporter of WyoFile.)
“We’re going to be adherent to the agreement,” Banner Western Division President Margot Karsten said during a meeting this week. “Fourteen out of 17, that’s a good track record, and we’re going to be perfect next year.”
The assessment, and Banner’s response to it, could shape the future management of Wyoming’s biggest hospital, a regional trauma and referral center that serves a huge swath of the state.
“This is an important topic in our community, and it has been for a long time,” Natrona County Commissioner Dave North said. “We need to move forward and grow, make sure that we’re doing what we have to do to meet those obligations, and make sure our community is getting what it needs, especially from our health care providers.”
The run up
Banner Health purchased Wyoming Medical Center for roughly $200 million in August 2020. The nonprofit hospital previously operated under a lease agreement with Natrona County, which owned the facility. Banner Health, headquartered in Phoenix, folded the hospital into its network of 33 nonprofit hospitals in six states.

The Natrona County Commission approved the arrangement, touted by supporters as a way to leverage Banner’s resources to create a preeminent facility and reduce the amount of care that leaves the state. Today, Banner Wyoming Medical Center operates two campuses and 14 care clinics.
In the transaction, Banner agreed to comply with contractual stipulations, including providing 24/7 emergency department care and retaining certain levels of maternity and trauma care, along with other essential services. 
But not long after Banner took over, stories began to percolate in the community about service declines, doctors quitting, long waits and poor care. Those experiences spurred a group of concerned citizens to launch a campaign aimed at bringing the level of care back to what they said the community deserves. 
Stories of long wait times, prescriptions going unfilled, understaffed departments and an exodus of doctors disrupting continuity of care were unacceptable, the citizens group said. The group worried eroding services would send residents elsewhere, degrading hometown quality and compounding health care challenges.
Banner defended its management. Ownership changes always trigger turnover and turbulence, CEO Lance Porter said at the time, but Banner had worked to iron out issues and provide excellent care. 
The citizens brought their concerns to Banner administration and Natrona Collective Health Trust — which oversees Banner’s contractual compliance. The group also asked the Natrona County Commission, which plays a role in enforcing Banner’s obligations, to weigh in.
The Health Trust hired PYA in February to provide a third-party determination of whether and how Banner is living up to its commitments. 
The results 
In the months since, PYA reviewed the 2020 sale documents, toured the hospital and interviewed some 25 stakeholders. Consultants dug into appointment-wait-time data and patient transfer logs, among other information. 
One thing was clear, said Lee Ann Odom, a PYA principal. 
“We will say collectively that the entire community, you could feel the passion and the care and everybody’s alignment around wanting to have high-quality, excellent patient experience here in Casper,” she told commissioners during a Monday presentation of the findings.

The assessment, which compared 2024 with 2020, identifies 17 covenants Banner Health is on the hook for. In 2024, Banner met 13 of those. It maintained the Wyoming Medical Center as a Wyoming service area hub and acute care center, kept up essential services and collaborated with other hospitals, the report found. 
However, consultants also found four areas lacking. One involved the Wyoming Advisory Board. That panel was established to act as a liaison for the public to provide input to Banner Health and Wyoming Medical Center. Such boards are industry standard in instances of management transition.  
“It is critically important as organizations transition that they listen and they listen carefully and they listen authentically to the communities that they serve,” Odom said. Though the board met in 2024, she said, consultants did not find satisfactory evidence of active listening, with the community having meaningful input into things like strategic planning, CEO performance, clinical programs and expansion.
Banner also failed to meet its capital investment commitment. It had committed to spending $30 million on capital investments by 2023, but only reported outlaying $17.8 million. 
And finally, PYA docked Banner for falling short on its “commitment to quality, safety and patient satisfaction” and “growth of clinical capabilities, services and access.”
Hot seat
During the discussion that followed PYA’s presentation, commissioners put both Banner and Trust representatives in the hot seat with pointed questions. 
Commissioner Dallas Laird asked Trust representatives why the advisory board failed to function properly. 
“I cannot say why that is the case,” Trust Board Chair Eric Nelson answered, “but I can tell you, we’re committed to finding that out, to making sure that that advisory committee is empowered to do what it needs to do.” 
Laird also asked about the missed capital investments deadline. 
Banner Wyoming Medical Center CEO Porter said the hospital has embarked on 19 major renovation projects and that reporting time between allocated and disbursed funds can lag.

“If you remember, one of the major reasons Wyoming Medical Center was sold is because they didn’t have access to capital, and so we inherited a building that was very old,” Porter said. “And so we’ve engaged in some of these renovations that have been needed for a very long time.” 
The hospital’s 2025 annual report, Porter believes, “will show that we are in full compliance and on track to be in compliance going forward.”
Banner is proud of the PYA assessment, Porter added. 
“Without a doubt, health care has improved since 2019,” he said. “We have expanded our access. We’ve expanded our number of physicians and providers that are providing care. I think we’ve done a phenomenal job.” 
Commissioner Peter Nicolaysen regretted that the PYA report only focused on 2024, he said, rather than including the first three years following the transaction.  
“I think that the community’s expectation was that the level of health care and medical care in the community, as of the transaction date, was going to be maintained, if not improved,” he said. “Over my first two years on this board, I heard from countless citizens of our community, with some tragic stories” about Banner’s level of care.
In addition, Nicolaysen said, “we’ve lost dozens and dozens and dozens of health care professionals … So I’m concerned that we’ve lost a lot of ground just to begin with.”
What’s next?
Banner will address the four covenant areas it was found lacking, Western Division President Karsten told commissioners. It is already making improvements for the advisory committee and will also bring its capital investment tracking more in line with actual spending, she said.

Banner has made progress, Bob Price of the concerned citizens group said, but work remains to be done to ensure it meets obligations for operating the hospital. The citizens’ group offered several recommendations to the commission. Increasing financial transparency, demanding stronger community health care metrics and strengthening annual reporting standards all made the wish list. 
“We do feel that it must fall to you, the county commissioners,” Price said. “The decisions made now will shape outcomes for years to come.”
The Trust will also do more, representatives said. 
“We are responsible for ensuring that the covenants that were made at the time of the transaction are being lived up to,” said Trust CEO Beth Worthen, “and we take that responsibility extremely seriously.”
PYA was retained for three years.

Commonly found farther north in boreal forests, great gray owl breeding distribution dips down into the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem — all the way down to the Winds’ southern tip. 
The post Southernmost of its kind appeared first on WyoFile .","Like many Wyoming residents on the 4th of July, Frank Stetler fled the parades, explosions and mayhem a couple years ago, opting instead for the quiet of the mountains.  
The Lander resident, who works as a Wyoming Game and Fish Department nongame biologist, sought refuge in the southern Wind River Range. 
Headed down a trail, he noticed a snapped-off lodgepole pine snag with an “odd shape” on top. 
“Then, all of a sudden, I was like, ‘Oh, the odd shape on top of this lodgepole is looking back at me,’” Stetler recalled. 
It was an unmistakable gaze for a serious birder like Stetler, a past chair of the Wyoming Birds Records Committee. He knew immediately: Great gray owl. Not only that, but based on calls he heard and the proximity of another great gray he spotted shortly thereafter, it was a nesting female. 
Holding up his phone camera to a binocular lens, Stetler snapped a photo of the find.
It was exciting. The distribution of breeding great grays, a large owl with an especially pronounced facial disc, wasn’t known to extend so far south into the Rocky Mountains. Other than the genetically distinct great gray subspecies, Strix nebulosa Yosemitensis, which lives in California’s Sierra Nevada Range, this was the southernmost of its kind. 
Stetler and others kept an eye on the closely guarded nest site, but owlets never materialized that summer of 2023. 
The Winds owl’s nest site was a challenging location, at more than 2,500 feet higher than the more typical great gray nest sites found in Jackson Hole. The high altitude pushed the nesting timing back by a whole month. And it was located in a place where it could be easily disturbed by people recreating or looking deliberately for the great gray — a prized find. 
“If birders travel to Wyoming, for any birding, [great grays] are usually at the very top of the list,” Stetler said.

Although the nest failed, there’s some evidence that great grays are continuing to eke out an existence in the southernmost reaches of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. 
“We had one in [Lander] City Park this winter that hung out for at least a month,” Stetler said. 
Unfortunately, the bird was found dead from a suspected vehicle strike. But there have been others. 
“We had one in town, off of Mortimore Lane, a month ago,” Game and Fish nongame bird biologist Zach Wallace said. “I saw it.” 
And there are still signs of Strix nebulosa high in the Winds.

On Saturday, great gray expert Katherine Gura, a Colorado State University research scientist, went up to survey the vacated nest site and larger territory that Stetler stumbled into two summers before. For hours, she hooted and combed over the Shoshone National Forest, scanning the skies for movement and timberstands for roost trees. 
Targeting the wet meadows where great grays make a living on voles and other rodents, Gura found what she was looking for. 
“I didn’t end up finding any owls, but I did find two fresh feathers, so the area is still occupied by great grays, which was exciting to confirm,” Gura reported to WyoFile in an email. “The wind and rain picked up, so it wasn’t great searching weather,” she added. “I’m sure they were around nearby!”

Once again, as temperatures climb skyward and instream flows on our once world-famous rivers plunge to new record lows, state agencies and those organizations supposedly dedicated to preserving those rivers have come up short.  Not just a little short, lethally short. 
There’s no point beating around the bush: We’re losing one of Montana’s greatest legacies –clean, cold rivers teaming with wild, not hatchery-raised, trout.
One might credibly wonder: How this is even possible? How could the state’s “Public Trust Doctrine” be tossed in a corner? How can lame organizations supposedly advocating for rivers and fish could be so incredibly ineffective as river after river is restricted to fishing or — as the Upper Madison and Big Hole — closed completely? 
It’s not like this is something that snuck up on us.  The trends are clear, and have been clear for more than 40 years as snowpacks dwindle in our shorter, warmer winters, melt faster in our earlier, hotter springs (90 degrees in May this year), and the rivers and fish bake in our longer, hotter summers.  
This is not a question of fact — it’s a question of government malfeasance to ignore the realities, the opportunities, and the solutions.  There are laws on the books to allow the state, organizations, or private individuals to lease water for instream flows and funding to do so.  All of it is on a willing lessee-lessor basis — the old capitalist system in action where if you want something, you pay for it.
Yet, the most recent and egregious example of water capitalism has nothing to do with keeping the rivers and fish alive – quite the opposite.  The town of Big Timber has decided to sell more than 100,000 gallons of Boulder River water daily to the increasingly infamous Crazy Mountain Ranch to truck water to its golf course for their mega-wealthy out-of-state clientele. 
After other water rights holders filed complaints with the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation claiming the ranch was illegally stealing water to which it did not have rights, the agency finally took action to stop the diversions.  
And that’s where Big Timber comes in.  The city has water rights on the Boulder River for municipal purposes.  Yet, despite the fact that the Boulder is flowing at half of average, Big Timber is pumping water out of the river into tanker trucks to be hauled up to the Crazy Mountain Ranch…but for a price, of course.
There’s so much wrong with this it’s hard to know where to start, but a good place would be to question for exactly what uses Big Timber’s water rights were permitted.  And you can bet it was not to be sold and trucked to a completely different drainage to water a private golf course.
This is a horrific precedent – and hopefully will be found illegal — because if Big Timber can get away with selling municipal water rights to private, for-profit corporations, there’s no reason every other Montana municipality couldn’t follow suit and trash what’s left of our long-suffering rivers to fatten their city budgets.
The ever-slow-to-act Department of Natural Resources and Conservation should already be involved since whatever water Big Timber is selling is likely for a non-permitted use and in effect robbed from downstream water rights holders.
It’s bad enough Gov. Greg Gianforte won’t keep our rivers healthy and flowing.  But allowing a municipality to sell precious water to billionaires for their golf course is totally unacceptable — and nothing short of governance gone horribly wrong.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MaxPixel.net-Pipe-Faucet-Water-3863039-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-25 06:56:38.184539

(Photo: John Partipilo)Despite deep ties to Tennessee conservatives and Republican power players, Belmont University is finding itself targeted by the Trump administration and its allies.
Belmont has long been intertwined with the GOP. Gov. Bill Lee was once on its board, and the state’s former Republican House speaker served as an adjunct professor, while its law school dean was the former U.S. Attorney General under President George W. Bush. The medical school is named for HCA co-founder Thomas Frist Jr., brother of former Republican Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and Tennessee’s wealthiest person.   
All these ties make the recent attacks by U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles of Culleoka more noticeable. Noem accused the university of “obstruction against federal immigration law.” 
Ogles’ former campaign treasurer and prominent conservative donor Lee Beaman is on the Belmont University Board. 
Yet Ogles called for the U.S. Department of Education to investigate the university for violating President Donald Trump’s executive order to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs and called for the elimination of any federal funding for the university if found in violation  
Both accused Belmont of a litany of violations related to immigration and DEI after a conservative news outlet published an edited video of a school staffer discussing inclusivity programs and potential students who might not be legal U.S. residents.
This type of language has turned Belmont into persona non grata with Trump allies, but it also means the alleged undocumented students graduated from high school and did well enough academically to be admitted to the challenging and pricey university.
Ogles has been calling for investigations into several Nashville-related organizations since Trump’s election
He demanded an investigation of Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell for updating a longstanding policy requiring city personnel to report interactions with federal immigration agents.
Of course, Ogles didn’t send out any statements showing he raised only $53,000 this year for the next election. But that’s another matter.
In this newest threat, Ogles says Belmont is “injecting anti-gospel DEI into its curriculum,” a violation of Trump’s order.
“The preservation of faithful Christian education in Middle Tennessee is non-negotiable,” Ogles said in a recent statement.
Ogles did not return a phone call for this article.

Belmont’s changing landscape  
Gov. Lee served on the Belmont board from 2011 until his first election in 2018, even though he graduated from Auburn University. Lee Company, which he placed in a blind trust, continues to hold a suite at the Curb Center where Belmont’s basketball teams play home games.
Granted, Belmont isn’t quite the same college it was 40 years ago when this writer haunted its hills and hooped for the former Rebels in old Striplin Gym, the site of numerous Battles of the Boulevard with Lipscomb.
Back then when enrollment was around 2,000, Belmont was connected to the Tennessee Baptist Conference, which provided funding and picked the college’s board members. All students were required to go to chapel two or three times a week and sit in assigned seats so attendance could be monitored. Some scofflaws got others to sit in their seats so they could skip. Seniors were to go to a seminar with a college dean, a requirement that wasn’t strictly enforced. (I skated.)
These days, with enrollment around 9,000, students can opt for other spiritual fulfillment through programs besides chapel, though it is still offered.
Belmont cut ties with the Tennessee Baptist Conference in 2007 and agreed to a $11 million settlement to set its own course with a board no longer dominated by the Baptist Church and, eventually, with members who didn’t have to be Christians.
Belmont wanted to grow, but it couldn’t stretch its legs unless it broke away from the Tennessee Baptist Conference, a part of the Southern Baptist Conference.
While attached to the past and its former life as Ward-Belmont College for Southern belles, Belmont has increasingly tied itself to Nashville’s music and arts community.
Curb Event Center, named for record industry executive Mike Curb, opened in 2003, completing the basketball program’s move to the NCAA from NAIA and a shift in athletics overall as the university dropped the Rebels moniker and its old Confederate trappings for the Bruins. The transformation wasn’t easy as the basketball teams, with no home gym or conference, had to play for several years at the Municipal Auditorium or go on the road. 
When Curb opened with an attached parking garage, offices, practice gyms and fitness areas, it seemed Belmont had built a four-star hotel on campus to replace a Motel 8. The center was a welcome relief from dumpy Striplin, and former players felt the university had graduated from the low-budget days when players were happy to have a bologna sandwich and bruised apple on road trips. 
Fast-forward to 2025, and Belmont is offering medical and law schools in addition to what is considered the premier music-business college in the country, often providing students with Music Row internships. 
Alberto Gonzales, the U.S. attorney general under President George W. Bush from 2005 to 2007, is dean of the law school, where former Tennessee House Speaker Beth Harwell taught as well. They’re not exactly bleeding-heart liberals, even if they don’t fit today’s chaotic conservatism.
Money doesn’t seem to be a problem, either, considering the multimillion-dollar, pillared academic buildings that line the campus.
The university also has a little building on Belmont Boulevard called the Fisher Center, that makes the Schermerhorn Symphony Center pale in comparison.
But if you want clear proof the university has gone to hell in a handbasket, consider its new outlook on alcohol.
Once scorned, banned and considered cause for removal, alcoholic beverages are allowed at university events. 
(You might be asking: What’s the difference between a Methodist and Baptist? A Methodist will say hello on the way out the door at the liquor store.)
No, they aren’t selling beer at ballgames, and fans aren’t getting hammered like Tennessee Vols backers at Neyland Stadium. A little wine and beer might be available at Belmont activities, if the organizers can swing it.
Belmont, though, remains an ecumenical, Christian university, and the administration under President Greg Jones is serious about recruiting all types of students. So far, the university has remained above the fray, declining to respond to questions about Ogles’ threats, none of which are likely to stop Belmont from thriving along Wedgewood Avenue on Nashville’s south side.

Federal agencies are working to establish a unified definition of ultraprocessed foods. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)A handful of government agencies have partnered to create a unified definition of ultraprocessed foods, which they hold are linked to adverse health outcomes.
The effort is part of the ongoing Make American Healthy Again directive led by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.
“Ultra-processed foods are driving our chronic disease epidemic,” Kennedy said in a press release. “We must act boldly to eliminate the root causes of chronic illness and improve the health of our food supply. Defining ultra-processed foods with a clear, uniform standard will empower us even more to Make America Healthy Again.”
HHS, in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Food and Drug Administration, announced a joint Request for Information, as the first step in the process to develop a federal, uniform definition of ultraprocessed foods.

Kennedy’s Make American Healthy Again report, released in May, included an entire section about ultraprocessed foods. The report cited the NOVA food classification’s definition that says ultraprocessed foods are: “industrially manufactured food products made up of several ingredients (formulations) including sugar, oils, fats and salt and food substances of no or rare culinary use.”
These substances include flavors, colorants, non-sugar sweeteners, and emulsifiers. The MAHA report said generally, ultraprocessed foods are ready-to-eat foods that are high in sugars, refined grains or sodium and low in fiber and essential nutrients.
According to the press release from HHS, USDA and FDA, around 70% of packaged products in the U.S. food supply are typically considered ultraprocessed. The release also said children get around 60% of their calories from these foods.
The release and the Make America Healthy Again report point to ultraprocessed foods as a “driving factor” in the “crisis” of childhood chronic diseases. The consumption of these foods, according to the release, is linked to cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, cancer, obesity, cancer and neurological disorders.
“The threats posed to our health by foods often considered ultra-processed are clear and convincing, making it imperative that we work in lockstep with our federal partners to advance, for the first time ever, a uniform definition of ultra-processed foods,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said in the release.
Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins vowed to include the “the great men and women of the agriculture value chain” in the conversation throughout the process.
“President Trump has made it a priority to improve health outcomes for American families and communities,” Rollins said in the statement. “And this Request for Information is yet another step in seeking commonsense ways to foster improved and more informed consumer choice.”
The health impacts of ultraprocessed foods are also part of a research initiative between FDA and the National Institutes of Health. A uniform definition will help to “pave the way” for consistent research, policy and the ability to address associated health concerns, according to the HHS release.

(Courtesy of ACLU Nebraska)OMAHA — Another of the roughly 70 undocumented workers detained after a June 10 immigration raid in Omaha was released on bond this week — but only after a nationally known civil liberties group intervened and federal officials acknowledged an “oversight.”
The Guatemalan man was among about 25 of the Glenn Valley Foods workers still held in a North Platte jail. About another 25 others already were out on bond, and about 17 earlier were returned to their native countries, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

But the case of the just-released worker marks what advocates called a “cruel” new twist not only in the ongoing Glenn Valley Foods investigation, but also in how immigration detentions are being handled nationally, according to his legal team, which expanded recently to include the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska.
“It seems like the rules are changing on a daily basis,” said Mindy Rush Chipman, executive director of ACLU Nebraska.
 July 8 memo 

Here are the latest layers of the Guatemala man’s saga, his lawyers said, adding that he feared to be named publicly.
An immigration judge on July 9 set a $10,000 bond, which the man paid the next day with help from Prairielands Freedom Fund. His family made the four-hour trek from Omaha to North Platte and was waiting for him when the group was told that ICE had blocked his release.
A nearly two-week tussle between lawyers ended in federal admission of an “oversight” from ICE, ACLU said, and led to a bright moment for the Guatemalan man: He was reunited July 21 with his partner and two children and is at home while his lawyers try to build an asylum case for him to stay in the U.S. 
Feeding some of the federal government’s resistance to releasing him on bond, the lawyers believe, is new and sweeping guidance the Trump administration issued via a July 8 memo that essentially denies bond hearings or release for immigrants who arrived in the country illegally, calling on nearly all to be detained for the entirety of the time while they legally fight deportation.
Practically, that likely translates into lengthy jail stays lasting months or years. In the case of the Omaha man, for example, his next hearing was scheduled for April 2026.

Attorneys contend the policy shift is based on an incorrect legal interpretation by the Justice Department that rips away noncitizens’ right to a bond hearing and is a tactic to drag out detention to the point that unauthorized immigrants will choose to leave the country, basically deporting themselves. 
“It’s apparent ICE has one goal: remove immigrants as swiftly as possible,” said Omaha attorney Paul Forney, the Guatemalan man’s primary attorney. “In this case, ICE has demonstrated a blatant disregard for the rules, regulations and my client’s civil liberties.”
 ‘Closes a loophole’ 

An ICE spokesperson, on the other hand, said in a statement to the Nebraska Examiner that the change in approach “closes a loophole to our nation’s security” that the Biden administration and others had based on what it describes as an “inaccurate interpretation” of federal law. 
According to the memo, federal detention authority for people in the country without authorization is “extraordinarily broad and equally complex,” and the new direction aims to ensure “immediate and consistent application” of the Department of Justice’s legal interpretation while more operational guidance is developed. The memo, first reported by the Washington Post, noted that legal challenges are expected.
ICE officials declined to comment on several aspects, but said in a statement that the federal agency “never denied” the man “his freedom.” They said he illegally entered the country and alleged that he used stolen ID to work.
“ICE has every intention of continuing to work to ensure he is removed to Guatemala,” the statement said. “It’s time the focus be returned to those who are victimized, not those who are doing harm.”

Rush Chipman said her organization took on the case partly out of concern for due process. She said dozens of people detained by ICE in Nebraska, including some who were apprehended in the Glenn Valley raid, remain jailed after an immigration judge set a bond that typically leads to release. Some of the detainees have paid bonds and are still detained, she said.
“Whatever our immigration status, all of us have rights,” Rush Chipman said. “The federal government cannot legally disregard due process or hold people in custody … because of a new baseless determination that millions of community members are suddenly ineligible for release on bond.
“This can not become our country’s new normal.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
 Investigation still ‘ongoing’

The Guatemalan man has a long journey ahead as he seeks a legal way to remain in the U.S., she said. 
His predicament began June 10, when ICE led more than 80 federal, state and local law enforcement officers to execute a federal search warrant at the Glenn Valley plant. It was the state’s largest worksite enforcement operation since President Donald Trump took office the second time, and since a 2018 raid in the O’Neill area. Roughly 70 workers were detained.
ICE has described the operation as a “federal criminal investigation into over 100 cases of stolen identities.”
According to available federal court records, it appears that only one of the detained workers has been criminally charged for allegedly using the Social Security number of a U.S. citizen.
Asked for an update, the U.S. Attorney’s Office of Nebraska and ICE Homeland Security Investigations in a joint statement told the Examiner this week that the investigation still was ongoing.
They said ICE referred “administrative” identity theft violations to be resolved in immigration court for many” of the Glenn Valley workers. Separately, ICE asked the Nebraska U.S. Attorney to consider criminal charges for fraudulent use of Social Security numbers.

At least one case has been barred by a statute of limitations issue, the statement said, but it has not given up on others.
The agencies said that in some cases, administrative removal efforts provide a more cost effective way than pursuing federal criminal prosecution. 
In addition to the single criminal case related to Social Security fraud, two other workers have been criminally charged for other offenses, a Honduran man accused of brandishing a box cutter and resisting arrest and a Mexican man for re-entering the country after having been previously deported.
Lawyers working with the Glenn Valley cases say the bulk of those detained face administrative charges, not criminal, based on not being authorized to be in the country.
 Bond release blocked

Family members of the Guatemalan man had expected to bring him home upon payment of his bond July 10. At a July 9 immigration court hearing, a judge had found the man no flight risk or danger to his community and paved the way for his release, Rush Chipman said. 
She said the client had no criminal charges or convictions and faces the administrative charge of being in the U.S. without proper authorization.
“There is no authority at all to hold someone in this circumstance,” she said, though the Trump administration believes otherwise.
The man’s family was told after their drive, however, that his release was blocked based on objections from immigration authorities, who claimed the federal government had filed a notice of its intent to appeal. 
Forney, the man’s attorney, said there was no record of such notice, a point he raised repeatedly. Forney sought help from the ACLU, which intervened July 17.

On July 20, the ACLU said that an ICE attorney acknowledged “an oversight” and the man was released the next day.
 Bright in ‘dark chapter’ 

Rush Chipman said her organization continues to work with partners to help those locally and nationally affected by the “sudden change” in legal interpretation. 
She called it a dark chapter, but said she was buoyed by small victories, such as her client’s return home to continue his battle against removal.
Said Rush Chipman: “Seeing this man be able to hold his baby for the first time in well over a month was incredibly powerful.”

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.

The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.










The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling.


– Oregon Republican state Rep. Cyrus Javadi


Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.

Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.

Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

At Thursday’s Indiana Commission for Higher Education meeting held at Ivy Tech’s Madison campus, agency staff outlined how they plan to implement a new state law that requires public institutions to seek approval to continue low-enrollment degree offerings.
CHE officials also shared updated data on the more than 400 programs already impacted through “voluntary actions” by state colleges universities.
The affected degree programs made up about 20% of Indiana’s academic offerings but accounted for just 4% of all graduates, according to commission data.
“This degree program review process is an excellent complement … to helping students have clear choices and understanding what those are,” said CHE Commissioner Chris Lowery. “This is the first step to helping make [students’ decisions] easier.”
‘No impact on students’
According to the commission, 404 degree programs across six institutions have so far been affected. Of those, 74 were eliminated; 101 were suspended; and 229 were merged or consolidated.
The total is down from the 408 programs initially announced in June after at least one institution asked to delay or revise their plans, said Matt Butler, CHE’s chief academic officer.
Board leadership repeatedly emphasized that the overall degree changes are expected to have little to no impact on students, however.

Butler specifically pointed out that most changes were consolidations and suspensions — not outright eliminations. Programs on the chopping block all had zero enrollment or were already on track to be phased out, he said.
“These are zero to low, very low, enrollment and completion programs,” Lowery added.
Suspended and merged programs will go through a federally required “orderly teach-out,” which allows currently-enrolled students to complete their original degrees or transition to an equivalent.
“In effect, there was no impact on students,” Butler said. “This is a substantial but measured reduction of the degree program portfolio.”
The review process is part of the commission’s broader strategy to improve postsecondary outcomes amid declining college-going rates. The state’s college-going rate fell again in 2023 to just 51.7%, according to a new CHE report — down from 68% in 2012.
Fewer options, clearer choices
Lowery noted that many Hoosier high school students report plans to attend college but fail to follow through. 
He cited a 2023 survey commissioned by CHE which found that roughly 80% of Hoosier students and their parents saw value in pursuing higher education, yet the state’s college-going rate continues to decline.
“We have this delta of roughly 20% between those students who say they’re going to go … and those who end up taking action and actually enrolling,” Lowery said.



CHE officials believe one barrier is the overwhelming number of degree choices. Since the early 2000s, Indiana’s public institutions have added more than 1,000 bachelor’s degree programs — a 40% increase, even as enrollment has declined.
“We wonder why students are challenged in making these choices,” Lowery continued. “This degree program review process is an excellent complement … to helping students have clear choices and understanding what those are.”
What comes next
With the new law in effect, Indiana’s public higher education institutions must seek commission approval to continue any degree program that falls below a specific three-year average graduate threshold:

10 graduates for associate degrees,
15 for bachelor’s,
7 for master’s, and
3 for doctoral or education specialist degrees

CHE staff said they’re currently compiling a “mutual consensus list” of programs that fall below those benchmarks. Institutions will receive that list this month and must confirm its accuracy and submit program-level data — including enrollments, completions and credit hour production — to justify continuing any flagged degrees.










We wonder why students are challenged in making these choices.

Programs may be approved to continue under several categories, including as “mission critical,” “mission aligned,” or “discretionary.” CHE will leave those definitions open for institutions to interpret in the first year, officials said Thursday.
To avoid penalizing new programs, CHE has also adopted a “ramp-up” period that gives schools additional time — up to 10 years for bachelor’s degrees and 12 for doctorates — to meet the graduation thresholds before coming under review.
Final decisions will be based on staff recommendations, reviewed by the commission’s Academic Affairs and Quality Committee, and voted on by the full board.
Streamlining in practice
Some of the most significant restructuring has so far happened in teacher training and world language programs.
Ball State University, for example, is consolidating four separate STEM education majors into a single bachelor’s degree in science education, with students selecting concentrations like chemistry, life science or physics. 
Indiana colleges cut hundreds of low-enrollment degree programs ahead of state mandate

Purdue Fort Wayne is merging early childhood, elementary and secondary education degrees into a unified offering, while Indiana University plans to reorganize 27 education programs across its system.
On the world languages front, 31 programs were affected, with most merged or suspended and just one eliminated.
CHE officials said those types of mergers reflect smarter use of faculty, facilities and advising systems, and make degree choices easier for students.
Lowery added that the consolidation effort rounds out several years of policy work aimed at making college more accessible. Other ongoing commission focuses include expanded career coaching, increased financial aid and a freeze on tuition at most public institutions.
“This starts to really bring together the elements that we have seen in our own data and research,” he said. “That’s to help students access, afford, and make decisions relative to their education.”

(William Woody for Colorado Newsline)After a proposed provision in the recent Republican tax break and spending cut law that would have opened up millions of acres of federal lands for sale was axed, Colorado climate leaders and public lands advocates still didn’t have much to celebrate. 
That’s because the massive federal policy bill‘s surviving provisions governing oil and gas leasing on federal lands are “an egregious step back for the environment,” according to Melissa Hornbein, a senior attorney at the Western Environmental Law Center. 
The law makes it easier to lease federal lands in several Western states for oil and gas extraction. It also limits the ways by which this land can be regulated and lowers the royalty rate that oil and gas companies must pay the government, among other related provisions. 
“This bill goes in the wrong direction, essentially promoting oil and gas leasing, and then on top of that, it’s hamstringing (government) discretion to minimize the on-the-ground impacts of oil and gas infrastructure,” Hornbein said. “It’s exacerbating the climate crisis.”

The law, achieved through the reconciliation process in Congress and signed July 4 by President Donald Trump, who calls it the “big, beautiful bill,” mandates that the secretary of the Interior Department make federal lands available for oil and gas leasing on, at minimum, a quarterly basis in nine states, including Colorado. The available lands are governed by the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. 
Those agencies handle swaths of public lands that are typically multiuse. On Colorado’s public lands, hikers trek through forests of spruce and pine trees, families go camping and fishing and hunters search for elk in the northwest. The lands are also often used for commercial purposes, including by tourism and recreation companies, and for resource extraction. The state is home to 24 million acres of federal land.










This bill goes in the wrong direction, essentially promoting oil and gas leasing, and then on top of that, it's hamstringing (government) discretion to minimize the on-the-ground impacts of oil and gas infrastructure ... It’s exacerbating the climate crisis.


– Melissa Hornbein, senior attorney at the Western Environmental Law Center


By prioritizing oil and gas leasing above other uses for certain lands, the law “hurts everybody but the extractive industries,” said Colorado Springs resident and outdoorsman David Lien.
Lien, a longtime champion of public lands, frequently hunts in the San Juan National Forest near Durango, and he has hiked peaks across the state.
“We were able to stop the direct sell-offs (of public lands), but we probably didn’t anticipate how bad some of these other provisions would be,” Lien said. “To use a hunting term, I’d say the reconciliation bill passed by Congress has gutted public lands, in respect to extractive industries.”
The Bureau of Land Management declined an interview request for this article. 
“The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a historic piece of legislation that will restore energy independence and make life more affordable for American families by reversing disastrous Biden-era policies that constricted domestic energy production,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in a statement on Tuesday. “This marks a significant shift in how we manage our public lands, support energy development and work with local communities. The Department is proud to implement President Trump’s agenda and get the federal government back to working for the American people.”
Limited regulation
Federal lands used for oil and gas leasing are regulated by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management through a variety of means, including resource management plans, which are long-term land-use blueprints. 
Prior to the signing of the GOP reconciliation bill, these plans served as a starting point for regulation, not a finish line. But the law has made it so the government “may not add new restrictions outside of the conditions of approval included in the resource management plans” for oil and gas leases, according to a Bureau of Land Management statement.
Allison Henderson, the southern Rockies director for the Center for Biological Diversity, said this provision poses a “significant risk” to the environment, water supplies and vulnerable species of animals that live on public lands, because resource management plans “do not provide kind of the nitty-gritty, site-specific types of mitigation measures that are necessary.”
Resource management plans are typically updated every 10 to 20 years, and a single plan can often cover a wide region spanning hundreds of thousands of acres. Henderson said this makes the plans not adaptive or area-specific enough to be adequate as the exclusive means for environmental regulation of oil and gas leases on federal lands. 
“The RMPs are doing these broad, kind of general covers of big picture stuff,” Henderson said. “So this provision really seems to be like it’s trying to prevent anything more protective from going forward, which means that a lot will fall through the cracks.”
Lower royalty rate
Beyond its anticipated adverse effects on the climate, the law also decreases the revenue that states and the federal government bring in from leasing public lands for oil and gas extraction. 
When federal land is leased for resource extraction, oil and gas companies must pay royalties to the government. The GOP law sets the royalty rate for new onshore oil and gas leases at 12.5%, which is below market rate and significantly lower than the Biden-era royalty rate of 16.67%. This change means the government is expected to earn billions of dollars less in royalties over the next decade.
Oil and gas lease royalties in Colorado are split roughly equally between the federal government and the state. In 2024, oil and gas lease royalties for onshore federal land in Colorado totaled $131 million, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior natural resource revenue database.
“In addition to being a significant attack on public lands, this is also going to be causing us to lose billions of dollars in royalties, and then who knows what the ultimate billion dollars of cost it’ll be as a result of the climate emissions that are going to end up happening because of these leases,” Henderson said.

The federal agency also called for more collaboration from local communities and agencies.
Special Agent in Charge Robert Eikhoff said 40% of Mississippi’s law enforcement agencies do not provide information to the National Incident Based Reporting System. In 2023, the FBI reported that 73.2% of law enforcement agencies nationwide reported their data to NIBRS. 
The FBI can only assist agencies where it sees a need.
Winston County and the city of Louisville were chosen for a targeted operation due to increased criminal activity. In Winston County, with a population of less than 17,500, the national reporting system data shows crimes against people increased by 130% from 2020 to 2023. In 2024, 104 crimes were reported by the Winston Police Department and 99 were reported by the Winston County Sheriff’s Department.
Eikhoff wants local agencies to report data to the national system to understand what “communities are experiencing” and to help become “partners” with federal law enforcement.
The FBI created the system in the 1980s, but it didn’t become the official crime data tracker until 2021. It tracks 44 more offense types than the previous tracker, includes demographic data, and location categories like hotel or school, among other data that provides context to crime. 
The last reporting system only listed the most serious offense from each reported crime. It now includes every offense committed as part of a crime.
A recently passed Mississippi law mandated that all local agencies report numbers to the FBI data base by Dec. 31, 2025. A previous version of the law would deprive state funding from law enforcement agencies that didn’t report data. As early as 2013, the Department of Justice has offered grant money to help agencies report their data.
Former Byram Police Chief Luke Thompson was part of the initial meetings to help law enforcement agencies report their data to the National Incident Based Reporting System, in 2017. He was surprised to learn that Mississippi tracked domestic violence fatalities from statewide newspaper coverage.
In 2025, the FBI is hoping to collaborate with other local agencies that might lack the equipment and budget to investigate crime.
“If we don’t have that relationship, then we can’t have that conversation and express to them what resources are available through us,” Eikhoff said.
Rural counties and financially struggling law enforcement agencies don’t always have the tools and manpower to investigate serious crimes. The consequences can be low clearance rates and low morale.
The mean annual wage for police and sheriff’s patrol officers in Mississippi was $42,900 in 2023, which is among the lowest in the country. Old equipment and proper training requires higher police budgets than some rural cities and counties offer.
“We appreciate the FBI and the resources that you gave us to make these arrests,” said Louisville Police Chief Sean Holdiness. “Hopefully, we can get back to normal.”
Although violent crime has decreased over the last three years, the FBI announced the existence of at least 200 gangs operating in Mississippi. They estimate that 20 national gangs are operating in Mississippi today. They include “neighborhood gangs.”
“These neighborhood gangs, they’re younger, they’re not driven wholly by the financial gains that you get from the national gangs,” said Eikhoff. 
Eikhoff brought up a shooting that he estimates had over 100 rounds.
“That is what got our attention,” he said.
Mississippi has the highest gun death rate in the United States. The overall gun death rate increased 66% from 2013 to 2022. In October 2024, a federal jury convicted a Mississippi man for trafficking over 60 weapons from Belzoni to Chicago.
No specific number of guns were reported seized yet as part of Operation Summer Heat in Mississippi. In Kentucky’s recent Summer Heat operation, 82 guns were seized.
“The fact that someone’s carrying a weapon in and of itself is something that we have to be very mindful of in terms of constitutional rights,” Eikhoff said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/24172125/IMG_2304.jpg,,,2025-07-25 06:56:38.184539

(Krisanapong Detraphiphat | Getty Images)“What is done in the dark will be brought to the light” sounds good in theory but doesn’t work in practice without proper application of the right kind of light. Police procedurals and true crime fans are familiar with the dramatic crime scene device of gathering the principles, turning off the lights, and using an ultraviolet (UV) light to expose the icky remains of deeds been done. Things not visible to the naked eye in the regular light. Things otherwise hidden, or unknown, or not even really considered until the unnatural light shows what really happened. 
In the policy world, there are no UV lights to forensically examine what is left behind on the political carpets and cultural sheets. But you can follow the money. And pumping money into something will quickly reveal how something is and isn’t working, true priorities, and level of competence. 
The how and why of the opioid crisis is a conversation in the far distance behind the pressing demands of “do something.” The latest round of “do something” discourse regarding the opioid crisis is what is being done with the settlement money. In West Virginia, the split goes 72.5% to the West Virginia First Foundation, 24.5% to local governments, and 3% to the state. 
As reported by Caity Coyne, we now have the data on the first opioid settlement allotments to local governments. More than half of the funding went to law enforcement in various ways. Different types of quick reaction efforts with first responders and emergency medical services made up 10% and 9% of the expenditures, respectively. Following that was paying off jail bills, with treatment programs a distant fifth place. 
Money, or more specifically how people in positions of authority spend money, tells us the truth. And the glaring truth so far beyond the big dollar sign headlines is that the same folks are going to do the same things they’ve been doing before. Which means after a brief fiscal spreadsheet bump, the same results will return and continue unabated. Following the money leads the honest observer into dark rooms of how local and state government really is — or isn’t — working on the opioid issue, and finding out that the right UV light shows plenty of bad residue.  
It’s hard to blame local governments for using the one-time windfall to try and fix long running fiscal problems. Municipalities wanting to use the money to stem the surging jail bill costs came up immediately when the distribution of funds first became reality. Allowable, under the very broad guidelines of the settlement money. But prioritizing the near-term budget issues compared to the long-term cost of not addressing the opioid crisis is an example of monies pitched as help and a fresh start going to fund business as usual.  
The funding gap between punishment and treatment is the most glaring in the settlement expenditure data. More than 50 years and more than a trillion dollars into the War on Drugs, making law enforcement an ever-growing business that will, by both omission and commission, require a constant drug customer to maintain funding is the standard operating procedure. “Do something” fits into law enforcement data points and viral videos better than the messy, expensive, inexact science of treatment that has a lot of ugly to it before improvement comes. 
Cops cracking down makes for good PR and bite-sized video clips. Good PR makes for good funding. An addict trying to get a second or third chance at treatment while navigating the criminal justice system, seeking help from social services, and trying to put their family back together in family court does not make good PR. That sort of human struggle makes for horrible video clips, and tends to bring out the absolute worst in modern media audiences that judge immediately and en masse before moving quickly on.  
In a perfect world, such realities would be highlighted with regularity and as much attention as the big dollar sign settlement announcements were. In that world the very hard and detailed work of bettering people would get as much attention as the flashy buying of equipment, hiring of more personnel, or temporarily balancing an always-struggling municipality budget. 
But we don’t live in that world.  
We live in a world where far too many are happy to think throwing money at the problem will make it go away. A world where somehow handing big money to folks who were not competent or wise in the handling of lesser sums prior will suddenly solve everything. A world that is happy to be doing something on the surface that looks like a quick, clean doing something, but doesn’t want a UV light to ever show the icky mess of what is really going on. A world that is fine with all sorts of bad as long as “those people” are available for blame, and dollar amounts spent is more important than actual results.
 All of this is being done right out in the open. The reporting is there, the numbers are there, the intentions are there. Folks who ask how the opioid crisis became so bad in the first place can find the answer in how the opioid settlement is unfolding: Gradually, then suddenly. The reality is most folks can’t be bothered with dark rooms and UV lights that might show the truth not readily visible. 
This isn’t TV, after all.

Santiago/Getty Images)Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.

The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.
Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.

Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.

Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

A candidate for an open seat on the Detroit public school district’s board withdrew her name from consideration as questions arose about the use of ChatGPT in her application materials.
The Detroit Public Schools Community District confirmed that Traci Ricks withdrew her application on Wednesday. She had been scheduled to be interviewed for the position by the board Thursday evening.
Ricks has not said publicly why she dropped out. She alerted the school district on the same day Chalkbeat and BridgetDetroit asked about the survey responses.
Phone calls, as well as multiple messages sent via email and social media for accounts belonging to a Detroit resident with that name were not returned. The district did not immediately release contact information for the candidates.
One survey response attributed to Ricks on the district’s website included text that appeared to have been copied and pasted from a dialogue with ChatGPT, a chatbot that uses generative artificial intelligence.
Ricks identified herself as an educator and advocate in the 13-question survey, which is a mandatory step in the school board appointment’s application process. She was one of 15 people vying for the open seat left vacant by Angelique Peterson-Mayberry, who resigned this month. The new member will finish out her term through the end of 2026.
One of the questions that candidates were required to answer was, “From your perspective, what are the challenges facing our school district?”
This is the response attributed to Ricks: “ChatGPT You said: How should I respond to this question as it pertains to my interest in a vacant DPSCD school board seat: What approach would you take to help pass millage renewals, millage increases or Headlee override elections? ChatGPT said: Here’s a strong and strategic way to respond to that question, tailored to your candidacy for a vacant DPSCD school board seat.”
Some of the same or similar language was used in responses to other questions.
Board member Sherry Gay-Dagnogo said Wednesday she doesn’t think it’s necessarily a problem if an applicant uses AI to prepare application materials.
“As long as the thoughts were original and come from thinking — and that will become evident during the interview process — I don’t think that it is automatically something that is done negatively,” she said about Ricks’ application.
The board member said she supports the use of evolving technology, like ChatGPT, when it is used as a tool to refine perspectives.
Stephen J. Aguilar, associate professor at the University of Southern California Rossier School of Education and associate director of the university’s Center for Generative AI and Society, said there can be helpful and ethical ways to engage with generative AI as a tool to inform one’s understanding and views.
However, he said copying and pasting answers directly from ChatGPT is “cognitive laziness.”
As AI becomes increasingly common, Aguilar said more questions will come up about how it should be used.
“Folks really need to understand and interrogate what their role is in using AI,” he said.
In addition to the survey responses, the Detroit candidates were required to submit resumes and letters of intent in their applications. The district has not publicly released the candidates’ resumes or letters.
Chalkbeat asked the district for those materials and was told an open records request was necessary to review them.
That request was filed on Monday. On Tuesday, the district responded that it needed an extension of 10 business days — the maximum permitted under state open records law — to provide the documents.
Candidate interviews began on Monday. All of the candidates’ application materials and interviews will be scored by board members. On Friday, the board chair and vice chair, along with an independent third party, will tally the scores.
The board will vote to select its new member at a public meeting starting at 5 p.m. on July 28 at Martin Luther King Jr. Senior High School.

(Photo by Emily Elconin/Getty Images)Amid recent political rhetoric about rising crime and violence in American cities, a new analysis shows that violent crime has continued to decline this year.
Homicides and several other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, dropped during the first half of 2025 across 42 U.S. cities, continuing a downward trend that began in 2022, according to a new crime trends report released Thursday by the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
Homicides fell 17% in the first half of 2025, compared with the same period in 2024, among the 30 cities that reported homicide data, according to the report.
During that same period, five cities saw increases in homicide — ranging from 6% in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to 39% in Little Rock, Arkansas.
While the report’s authors say the continued drop in violent crime — especially homicides — is encouraging, they note that much of the decline stems from a few major cities with historically high rates, such as Baltimore and St. Louis.
More than half of the cities studied have higher homicide rates than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, though, the analysis found that there were 14% fewer homicides during the first half of 2025 compared to the same period in 2019.
The authors say more research is needed before crediting any specific policy or practice for the continued drop in violent crime.
The group’s findings come as President Donald Trump continues to amplify concerns about crime, at times citing misleading statistics and narratives.
Most violent crime rates have fallen back to pre-pandemic levels, new report shows

In a Truth Social post earlier this week, Trump claimed that cashless bail — a practice that allows people charged with a crime to be released pretrial without paying money, unless a judge deems them a threat to public safety — were fueling a national crime surge and endangering law enforcement.
He wrote: “Crime in American Cities started to significantly rise when they went to CASHLESS BAIL. The WORST criminals are flooding our streets and endangering even our great law enforcement officers. It is a complete disaster, and must be ended, IMMEDIATELY!”
Some research suggests that setting money bail isn’t effective in ensuring court appearances or improving public safety. Opponents of ending cash bail often raise concerns that released suspects might commit new, potentially more serious crimes. While that is possible in individual cases, studies show that eliminating cash bail does not lead to a widespread increase in crime.
The Truth Social post also marked a sharp shift from Trump’s remarks during a June roundtable with the Fraternal Order of Police, where he claimed the national murder rate had “plummeted by 28%” since he took office — a figure that overstates the decline and overlooks the fact that murder rates began falling well before he returned to office.
According to data consulting firm AH Datalytics, which manages the Real-Time Crime Index — a free tool that collects crime data from more than 400 law enforcement agencies nationwide — the number of homicides between January and May 2025 was 20.3% lower than the same period in 2024.
Similarly, data released in May by the Major Cities Chiefs Association showed that homicides fell roughly 20% in the first quarter of 2025 compared with the first three months of the prior year. The group’s data is based on a survey of 68 major metropolitan police departments nationwide.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Researchers at the Council on Criminal Justice note in their report that it’s difficult to pinpoint a single reason for the drop in homicides, but they note that fewer people appear to be exposed to high-risk situations, such as robberies.
Most major crimes fell in the first half of 2025 compared with the same period last year, according to the council’s report.
Motor vehicle thefts dropped by 25%, while reported gun assaults fell 21%. Robberies, residential and non-residential burglaries, shoplifting, and aggravated and sexual assaults also saw double-digit declines
Drug offenses held steady, while domestic violence reports rose slightly — by about 3%. Carjackings declined 24% and larcenies were down 5%.
Compared with the first half of 2019, before the pandemic and nationwide reckoning over racial justice and policing, overall homicides are down 14%, robberies by 30%, and sexual assaults by 28%.
Still, more than 60% of the cities in the council’s study sample report homicide rates that remain above 2019 levels.
Motor vehicle theft remains the only crime tracked in the report that is still elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels — up 25% since 2019 — although it has declined sharply since 2023.
The council also released another analysis on the lethality of violent crime, showing that while violent incidents have decreased, the share of violence that ends in death has increased significantly. In 1994, there were 2 homicides per 1,000 assaults and about 16 per 1,000 robberies. By 2020, those figures rose to 7.2 and 55.8, respectively.

Josh Shapiro to join 23 states and the District of Columbia in suing the Trump administration for withholding funds already allocated by Congress.","A parked school bus. (Photo by Phillippe Gerber/Getty Images)Recently, the U.S. Supreme Court gave the Trump administration the go-ahead to eliminate the positions of 1,300 U.S. Department of Education employees in its push to dismantle public education as we know it in this country.
Along with personnel cuts that will reduce the agency by half,  nearly $7 billion already allocated by Congress for K-12 education nationwide slated for release on July 1 was also withheld hours before it was to be disbursed. The only warning the states got was a three sentence email on June 30 announcing the freeze.
This has blown a $230 million sized hole in budgets throughout Pennsylvania’s public education systems, prompting Gov. Josh Shapiro to join 23 states and the District of Columbia in suing the Trump administration for withholding funds already allocated by Congress.
Stakes are high. The Philadelphia school district, the largest in the state, also accounts for the fourth largest expenditure of federal education funds to any school district in the nation.
In keeping with President Donald Trump’s promises on the campaign trail “to return the responsibility for education to the states,” the administration has begun severing the partnership between the federal government and the states.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Conservative lawmakers and their wealthy patrons have had nearly two centuries to warm to the idea of publicly financed education for America’s young people. During that time, their affection for universal education has only grown colder.
The idea that tax dollars should subsidize the educational aspirations of all Americans — including economically disadvantaged children — appears to be anathema to a class that preaches individual initiative as the only legitimate path to an egalitarian future. 
The federal Department of Education offered no explanation for its action, but a spokesperson for the White House Office of Management and Budget stated without citing  any evidence that “grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”
The $230 million previously earmarked for “after-school programs, teacher training, literacy, and education for migrant and non-English speaking students” according to reporting in the Capital-Star is mission critical, but the OMB and DoE made no promises about how long a full review of the allocated funds will take.
The downstream effects of Washington refusing to disburse the earmarked funds that Congress has already approved will be felt immediately in the commonwealth’s ability to plan most things requiring federal assistance moving forward. Again, the uncertainty this generates may be the point.
This is where a look at how the abrupt pulling of federal funds earmarked for Philadelphia schools is particularly instructive. Philly schools have been in crisis for years and can’t raise enough revenue to cover its annual budget without the infusion of city, state and federal funding.
Last year, the school district received $9.13 million for recruiting and teaching teachers, principals and staff through Title II-A; It received $4.6 million for instruction for English-learning and immigrant students under Title III-A and $13.2 million for academic enrichments, technology, student well-being and improving conditions in schools under Title IV-A.
On July 18, the Trump administration agreed to release $1.3 billion of the $6.8 billion it froze. This will keep 21st Century Community Learning Centers grants that fund summer and after-school programs under Title IV-B chugging along. Philly schools received $12.6 million in Title IV-B funding last year, so this is good news even if it leaves the bulk of the school district’s budget underfunded.
This is why Gov. Shapiro and his colleagues are hoping to be successful  in their suit against the Trump administration. The Founding Fathers insisted that the most reliable bulwark to tyranny is an educated and informed electorate. 
This democratic ideal is worth more than the weight of standing armies. Generations of politicians have operated with a similar conviction: that a democracy is only as good as its schools.
Without the federal dollars already promised, Pennsylvania and its public school districts  will have to come up with a funded alternative plan that addresses the needs of its most vulnerable students at a time of maximum partisanship.. Breaking America’s social contract to educate its children is a no-brainer for Donald Trump, a man who has no respect for anything as genteel as a social contract — or any contract.

Trump’s own venture into education before his presidency was a sketchy diploma mill called Trump University. The seeds of his contempt for higher learning are visible in that scam in which he was ordered to pay a $25 million class action settlement to 6,000 students enrolled in the fake university that bore his name.
Education is not among Trump’s strong suits, but that won’t prevent him from holding the educational futures of Pennsylvania students or students across the nation hostage to his whims.
“We won with young,” Trump bragged shortly after winning the Nevada caucuses nine years ago when most failed to take him seriously or literally. “We won with old. We won with highly educated people. We won with poorly educated. I love the poorly educated,” he said to much derision.
A celebration of the “poorly educated” wasn’t a subversive attempt at humor on Trump’s part. It was an excruciatingly honest declaration of his intent. The poorly educated are a big part of his constituency. By slashing the education budget of Pennsylvania schools, he’s just trying to — expand his base.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/schoolbus-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-25 05:56:17.007223

(Photo by Michael G. Seamans/ Maine Morning Star)Maine’s democracy remains among the most accessible and resilient in the nation, with strong voter turnout, a largely representative state legislature, and an increased shift toward clean elections, despite some socioeconomic inequities in voting.  
That’s according to the 2025 State of Democracy in Maine report, compiled by the League of Women Voters of Maine, Maine Citizens for Clean Elections, and Maine Students Vote, which offers an assessment of several areas of the state’s democratic health — voter turnout, clean elections, campaign finance, government transparency and accountability.
“Despite some areas for improvement, we want Mainers to feel very confident in their democracy and that they should feel proud of where we stand,” said Jen Lancaster, communications director for Democracy Maine.
Maine has made progress over the years in improving accessibility for elections, leading to one of the highest voter turnouts in the country in recent elections. But people that are engaged in local, state and national elections still represent homeowners, wealthier communities and tend to not include the state’s diversifying population, the report found. Some other barriers to a healthy democracy include inaccessible county government systems and an overburdened judicial system.
State legislature is largely representative, but skews older 
Despite steady gains in gender parity — women now hold 41% of legislative seats, up from 27% two decades ago — the Maine Legislature remains disproportionately composed of older, wealthier white men, according to the report. Baby boomers make up nearly 60% of legislators, compared to 36% of the population. Structural barriers such as low legislative pay and lack of child care might be disproportionately affecting women and younger candidates, the report says.
However, Maine’s cabinet under the state’s first female governor, Janet Mills, has reached gender parity and beyond: women now hold 55% of executive leadership roles, a first in state history.
And the efficiency gap — a standard for measuring how closely the partisan makeup
of an elected body matches its voter base — is less than 1% for both the House of Representatives and Senate, meaning that the partisan makeup of the state legislature closely reflects the partisan split in votes cast, the report found. A high efficiency gap is indicative of gerrymandering.
Voter turnout is uneven across class lines
Maine continues to lead the nation in voter participation, ranking third nationwide with a 74.8% turnout rate in the November 2024 election (which was a bit lower than the record-setting 2020 turnout). Youth participation also outpaces the national average: 60% of young people aged 18-29 voted in 2024, second only to Minnesota.
But the report also found that voter turnout in the poorest House districts across the state, including some large diverse areas such as Lewiston, was half that of the wealthiest ones, such as Falmouth or Cape Elizabeth. Renters and residents of high-poverty districts were significantly less likely to vote, suggesting structural barriers to participation.
Lancaster said that voter turnout varying by home ownership in particular was a surprising finding of the report.
Renters are more likely to face residential instability, which makes it harder to know where and when to vote and to connect with local political issues and candidates, according to the report. For renters who move frequently, updating their voter registration address might also be an additional barrier.
Voter ID referendum threatens voter protections 
Maine is one of only two states — alongside Vermont — that allow incarcerated citizens to vote and is one of 14 states that does not require photo ID at the polls. These rules, along with same day voter registration, online voter registration, and absentee ballot drop boxes have helped keep turnout high. 
Maine Supreme Judicial Court upholds voter ID ballot question language

But the “Voter ID for Maine” initiative that will appear on the November 2025 ballot threatens to roll back many of these gains. The conservative Dinner Table PAC launched the campaign in April 2024 as an effort to require voters to show photo identification at the polls, citing concerns of voter fraud. However, the official five-page petition submitted to the state in January seeks to change several additional aspects of Maine election law. If passed, the referendum would impose strict ID requirements, limit absentee voting access, and repeal ongoing absentee voter status for seniors and voters with disabilities. 
The League of Women Voters of Maine labeled the initiative an example of voter suppression.
County governments and probate courts aren’t transparent
While Maine has made notable strides in election transparency and access, the report flags county governments and probate courts as stark exceptions. Unlike other branches of government, these institutions operate with limited public oversight, outdated online presence, and inconsistent transparency standards.
County government is responsible for staffing jails, sheriffs offices, district attorneys offices and spending of federal funds, such as American Rescue Plan funds and some of the opioid settlement money the state has received.
But people who run for county commissioner, sheriff and district attorney are often uncontested, the report found. In the last decade, only 35% of district attorney races had more than one candidate on the ballot. In sheriff races, only 28% were contested. In the last three elections, only 40% of county commission races were contested, and three races had no candidate on the ballot.
Information about county government meetings, financial audits or services is hard to get online, with website quality often being poor, the report also found.
Probate courts, which operate outside of Maine’s judicial system, also vary widely in how they manage case information and public records. Some counties lack even basic digital access to court schedules or decisions.

(Stock photo by Joe Sohm/Getty Images)As the last coal plants in Colorado shut down, nuclear power proponents are campaigning to replace them with nuclear reactors. An advisory committee for the city of Pueblo recommended that Xcel replace its Comanche 3 coal plant with an “advanced nuclear power plant.” Bolstering that effort, the Colorado Legislature recently passed a bill redefining nuclear as a “clean energy resource.”
Colorado’s only experience with nuclear power was not a good one. The Fort St. Vrain reactor near Platteville operated from 1979 until 1989, when it was shut down due to safety problems. It took three years to decommission the plant at a cost of $125 million, which, like the $200 million of plant costs, was passed on to Xcel ratepayers. A special facility has stored 244 canisters containing the reactor’s high-level radioactive waste for the past 36 years. Ultimately, they will need to be transported over Colorado roads to an as yet unidentified deep geologic site to be stored for thousands of years.
Should Colorado give nuclear power a second look? I argue no for three key reasons.
High cost and high risk
According to the financial firm Lazard, the cost of the electricity produced by a nuclear power plant (in dollars per kilowatt-hour) is three times that of solar and wind. The only new reactors recently built in the U.S., Vogtle Units 3 and 4, were completed seven years behind schedule at a cost of $36.8 billion — more than two and a half times the original budget. That high cost has resulted in higher electricity bills for Georgia Power ratepayers.
There is much talk today about developing new, untested small modular reactors, or SMRs (defined as 300 megawatts or smaller in size) to ostensibly lower the cost, and this is the technology being promoted in Pueblo. The problem here is that virtually anything — be it a power plant or a container of pretzels from Costco — is cheaper per unit item the bigger it is. Nuclear plants have gotten much larger over time because of this economy of scale. The Vogtle units are each 1,100 MW. A 300 MW plant will have a higher capital construction cost per kilowatt, and its delivered electricity cost will also be significantly higher. The one SMR design approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NuScale, which was scheduled to be built in Idaho, was canceled because its projected capital cost had risen to $20,000 per kilowatt — more than 10 times that of utility-scale solar with battery storage.
Very long lead times
The total time from concept to operation for a new nuclear power plant is about 15 years, compared to solar and wind plants, which take one to two years. Fifteen years is a long time to wait to address climate change and air pollution. And during that time, you could spend far less money deploying solar and wind and preventing all those emissions.
Bad fit for Colorado’s renewables-based electric grid
Nuclear proponents argue that because nuclear plants run 24 hours a day, they can fill in the gaps when solar and wind are not available. But let’s take a closer look at that claim. Xcel plans to provide 80% of its electricity from solar and wind in just the next five years. Although Colorado is very sunny year-round, grid operators must be prepared for occasional “dark lull” periods of four days or more when local solar and wind resources are limited by the weather. Xcel plans to burn stored natural gas in low-cost combustion turbines during these brief periods.
Now imagine if new nuclear power plants come onto the grid in 15 years. Like all nuclear plants in the U.S., they will need to be run at full power 24 hours a day to sell enough electricity to pay off their high debt. So, what happens when an occasional dark lull occurs, and solar and wind power drop off? The utility won’t be able to boost nuclear plant output because it will already be at full power. Furthermore, because it will duplicate power already being provided by solar and wind, it will cause that renewable electricity to be wastefully curtailed.
Nuclear power is too costly, too risky and too slow to deploy. And not only would nuclear power not support renewable energy generators on the grid, it would also actually work against these clean, low-cost technologies.

(Photo by Ken Castro/Rhode Island Current)The smell of smoke should never be the last thing a person experiences in their own home. Yet for residents of the Gabriel House assisted living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, that nightmare became a reality last week.
The fire that tore through their building, killing 10 residents and injuring more than 20 others, wasn’t just a tragic accident; it was a catastrophic failure of a system that promised safety and delivered a death trap.
Gov. Maura Healey’s emergency safety orders for all 273 assisted living residences in Massachusetts are a necessary first step. But why did it take bodies being carried from a smoldering building to mandate that evacuation routes be posted on a resident’s door? Why did it take a fatal blaze for the state to demand that facilities simply report the age of their fire safety systems?
These aren’t just uncomfortable questions. They are an indictment.
For too long, we have mistaken compliance paperwork for a culture of safety. We trusted that profit-driven facilities and overstretched state agencies were upholding their end of the bargain. The fire at Gabriel House burned that illusion to the ground.
The fact that the state must now order facilities to communicate safety plans to families reveals a terrifying gap in transparency. The mandate for immediate fire safety assessments confirms what many have feared: that the agencies tasked with oversight may have been flying blind, unaware of the crumbling infrastructure and inadequate protocols inside the very buildings they were supposed to monitor.
This isn’t just about one facility. It’s about a statewide system where the well-being of our parents and grandparents has been subordinated to bureaucratic convenience and the bottom line. The COVID-19 pandemic already exposed the fragility of our elder care systems. We learned nothing if we are now facing a fire safety crisis that was just as predictable and just as deadly.










We trusted that profit-driven facilities and overstretched state agencies were upholding their end of the bargain. The fire at Gabriel House burned that illusion to the ground.


If we are serious about preventing the next Fall River, our response cannot end with the governor’s press conference. Real reform is not a suggestion box; it is a set of non-negotiable demands. The industry’s pledges of cooperation are welcome, but trust must be earned through action, not press releases. We must demand:
·  Aggressive, Unannounced Inspections. End the charade of facilities self-assessing their way to a passing grade. We need surprise inspections with real teeth and steep, public fines for non-compliance.
·  Mandatory Staffing-to-Resident Ratios for Evacuations. A perfect evacuation plan is worthless without enough staff to execute it. We must establish and enforce staffing levels sufficient to get every resident out in a crisis, not just on a sunny afternoon.
·  A “Safe Buildings” Fund and Mandate. The state must create a fund to help older facilities modernize with critical upgrades like sprinkler systems, while also mandating that all facilities meet modern fire codes within a strict timeframe. No more grandfather clauses for safety.
·  A Public Safety Dashboard. Every family has the right to know the safety record of a facility before they entrust their loved one to its care. All inspection results, violations, and staffing levels must be published online in an easily accessible database.
Implementing these, and other, reforms could be achieved without wasting time for more study. An Assisted Living Commission, established in last year’s long-term care reform law, is due to report within weeks, although its draft report is largely silent on life safety recommendations. The commission should not worry about its August 1 reporting deadline if it gets this issue right. Attorney General Andrea Campbell is on the cusp of releasing new assisted living consumer protection regulations that could easily address issues responsive to the Fall River tragedy. There’s no reason to delay and both actions would be fitting memorials to the victims of the fire.
The residents of Gabriel House were more than statistics. They were mothers and fathers, grandmothers and grandfathers. They were people who trusted the Commonwealth to keep them safe in their final years. We broke that trust.
We cannot bring them back. But we can honor their memory by ensuring no other family has to receive that horrific phone call. The true test of our leadership will not be in the flurry of activity last week, but in the sustained, relentless oversight months and years from now, long after the cameras have moved on.
The ashes in Fall River are a stain on our conscience. The wake-up call has sounded. We cannot afford to hit snooze again.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)Attorney General Jeff Jackson traveled to Hillsborough on Thursday to visit a pumping station that flooded during Tropical Storm Chantal, spilling millions of gallons of wastewater into area rivers.
Jackson made the visit to the Hillsborough River Pumping Station to bring awareness to flood resilience funding that was frozen by the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA), of which roughly $5.1 million would have gone toward the construction of a new pumping facility on a hill outside of the floodplain. Flooding from Tropical Storm Chantal on July 6 rendered the existing pumping station inoperable, however, leading to the sewage spill.

“We’re talking about millions of gallons of untreated sewage being swept into the Eno River, which dumps into Falls River, which is the the river that I live next to. It’s the one that my kids get their drinking water from,” Jackson told reporters. “This is as clear an example as possible of why these funds were well-allocated and deserved to go where they were pledged to go.”
On July 16, Jackson joined a lawsuit with 19 other states challenging FEMA’ s decision to withhold funding issued through the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. According to Jackson, the agency owes $200 million to North Carolina for more than 60 already-approved sewage, drinking water, and flood resilience projects in the state.
“You’re forcing us to sue you in order to make you keep your word,” Jackson said. “The town of Hillsborough jumped through an enormous number of hoops to be eligible for these funds from FEMA. They did everything that FEMA asked them to do, and at the last minute, after they were approved, FEMA went back on their word.”
Local officials also drew attention to a planned BRIC-funded water supply project that would have allowed Hillsborough to maintain access to drinking water during an emergency through the Orange Water and Sewer Authority — including the UNC Hospitals Hillsborough Campus. Like the new pumping station, the town received funding through the planning phase before it was cut off without warning in the construction phase.
“Hillsborough sought and was awarded two BRIC grants by FEMA to help strengthen our water and sewer infrastructure, only to have them canceled without warning,” said Hillsborough Mayor Mark Bell. “We are scrambling to identify alternative funding sources to stay on track with these two critical projects, but the easiest, the fastest, and most common sense thing to do is to restore the BRIC grants.”
Governor Josh Stein made a similar call on a trip last week where he surveyed Chapel Hill businesses and homes flooded out by the storm. “There’s federal funding called the BRIC program that is intended for resilience. Unfortunately, the Trump administration turned that spigot off,” he said. “We’re in court right now to try to get that spigot turned back on.”
The BRIC program was also the subject of controversy in 2024 in the wake of Hurricane Helene, when state officials determined that outdated building codes in North Carolina led the state to lose out on roughly $70 million in BRIC funding, about $18 million of which would have gone to the western part of the state for flood preparation.
Jackson said the harm to communities like Hillsborough from the Trump administration action is more evidence that North Carolinians benefit from having an independent attorney general with the ability to take the federal government to court — a power that Republican lawmakers in the General Assembly have sought to eliminate.
“If you believe in using this office in a nonpartisan way, then you’d better go to bat for water and sewer, because that is the definition of nonpartisan,” he said. “There’s nothing woke about this pump station, nothing DEI about this pump station, nothing Green New Deal about it. It’s in a place that floods.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7242696-scaled-e1753394281750-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-25 05:56:17.007223

Jim Gooch, the chair of the House Natural Resources and Energy Committee, listens to testimony during a committee hearing. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)Two key Republican lawmakers in the Kentucky legislature are voicing support for a federal program helping tens of thousands of Kentucky households with heating and cooling costs as the Trump administration proposes to eliminate the funding.
Sen. Brandon Smith, R-Hazard, and Rep. Jim Gooch, R-Providence, co-chairs of the Interim Joint Natural Resources and Energy Committee, and other state lawmakers heard a Thursday presentation from a state official and a nonprofit executive director about assistance provided to Kentuckians through the federal Low Income House Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP. 
The federally funded program established in 1981 can provide low-income recipients with a one-time credit toward electricity bills during the summer or winter — including in emergency situations when someone is facing a utility disconnection — or can pay for heating fuel costs including paying for wood, kerosene or coal. LIHEAP can also help pay for energy efficiency improvements to a residence. 
The Trump administration in a budget proposal earlier this year called on Congress to completely eliminate the program’s more than $4 billion in funding, describing it as “unnecessary” and a “passthrough” to utilities. The administration wrote that low-income people instead can be supported “through energy dominance, lower prices, and an America First economic platform.” The administration also fired federal staff overseeing LIHEAP.
Gooch and Smith told the Lantern they were supportive of the program, though they also supported the Trump administration’s cost-cutting efforts to find efficiencies within LIHEAP. 
“It’s a program that’s much needed, and it’s been around a long time. I don’t think that it’ll be cut,” Gooch said, who has been in the legislature since 1995. “They may look at it a little bit, but we’d hate to see that fund completely go away because too many people rely on it.” 
68,059 households in Kentucky took advantage of the program’s “crisis benefits” to prevent utility disconnections, receiving an average amount per recipient of $345.07 for a total of $24 million in benefits, according to the state presentation Wednesday. More than $43 million through LIHEAP has been distributed to Kentuckians so far in the current fiscal year. 
Rick Baker, the executive director of Community Action Kentucky, an organization representing 23 community action agencies across the state that helps distribute LIHEAP funding, told lawmakers community action agencies have sometimes run out of LIHEAP funding for crisis situations such as utility disconnections within 30 days but that extra federal appropriations, such as through the CARES Act, have kept funding sufficient. 
“Some of these families without this system would have utilities disconnected,” Baker told the Lantern after his presentation. “If they did not have the resources to pay their electric bill or to get the coal or the wood, they would go without it. Because where else are they going to get it?”
Baker also said community action agencies were supportive of LIHEAP’s weatherization funding that can help pay for energy efficiency upgrades, such as insulating a home, to reduce a household’s “energy burden,” essentially the amount of household income that goes toward utility bills. Energy efficiency advocates argue that weatherization can be crucial in places such as Eastern Kentucky where residents grapple with a high energy burden. 
Any budget proposal by the White House would have to be approved by Congress which allocates and sets appropriations. The Obama and Clinton administrations have previously tried to cut LIHEAP funding for different reasons, such as pointing to falling energy prices, without success, according to the Washington Post. Trump also argued for defunding LIHEAP during his first term. 
Rep. Adam Moore, D-Lexington, asked Baker about how the potential for rising electricity rates in Kentucky could impact federal heating and cooling assistance, pointing to a report from the nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation Policy and Technology. Baker said with a finite amount of federal funding, more energy costs per household would generally mean fewer households aided by LIHEAP.
Smith said he believed LIHEAP was a “good program” and that the state legislature could step in to fund heating and cooling assistance if Congress were to cut it. But he also said he supported any effort by the Trump administration to improve the assistance program. 
“If they present us with a better way that’s more efficient, that gets more money to the people that need it and then gets rid of those that are abusing it, I’m open to hearing that,” Smith said. “I don’t see Kentucky abolishing it, but I won’t say that it may be upgraded.” 
The Trump administration in its proposal to eliminate LIHEAP funding pointed to a 2010 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office as evidence of “significant program integrity concerns.” That report identified potential cases of fraud within the program, though the office has since stated all recommendations from that report have been implemented.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0391-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-25 05:56:17.007223

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)In a display of unity, former Democratic Gov. L. Douglas Wilder joined several Democratic leaders in Richmond on Thursday to oppose what they say are partisan attacks on Virginia’s education system and universities. The event came on the heels of a group of George Mason University professors’ vote of no confidence in the school’s governing board amid a federal civil rights investigation, and weeks after the University of Virginia’s president resigned following federal pressure to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion efforts at the school. 
Democrats also announced they’re considering conducting an in-depth review of how the governor appoints members to governing boards including at Virginia’s colleges and universities, and reforming the process. The current process has come under intense scrutiny after Senate legislators rejected eight of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s appointees to college boards, and launched a lawsuit against the administration over the issue. 
“What we’re seeing today is not about policy differences. It’s about a pattern, a coordinated effort to silence, punish and erase,” said Wilder.
Wilder joined several House and Senate Democrats, who highlighted the academic successes of Virginia’s higher educational institutions, after President Donald Trump’s administration launched several investigations into Virginia’s universities, primarily the University of Virginia and George Mason University. 
CNBC ranked Virginia’s education system as the top system in the country for the second year in a row, despite the commonwealth dropping three spots to fourth overall as the best state to do business.
Within the past month, the Trump administration launched a fourth investigation at George Mason University, targeting the institution’s DEI initiatives, employees’ employment practices, and treatment of students. The list of investigations also included a separate query into alleged antisemitism on campus.
House Democratic Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, a graduate of George Mason, defended her alma mater and other institutions in the commonwealth.
“We believe in facts, we believe in freedom and we believe in the future of our students,” Herring said. “This generation of students deserves better than to be caught in the crosshairs of a partisan law affair. They deserve investment, not interference. They deserve opportunity, not obstruction, and they deserve degrees, not delusions.”
At UVA, former president Jim Ryan stepped down after the U.S. Department of Justice, under the direction of the Trump administration, put pressure on the institution following Title VI complaints and political scrutiny.
The U.S. Department of Justice also claimed that the institution failed to fully dismantle its DEI programs and merely rebranded its efforts.
In a statement from the governor’s office following the press briefing, Youngkin spokesman Peter Finocchio said that “there is no place for antisemitism” or “racial preferences driving admission or hiring decisions” in the commonwealth following the press briefing.
“We must follow the law as established by the Supreme Court and federal laws, including civil rights statutes,” Finocchio said. “Virginia’s world-class system of higher education will continue to be defined by our ability to graduate outstanding students who are fully prepared to succeed in the workforce.”
 DEI: The lightning rod

DEI initiatives are a lynchpin in the divide between Democrats and Republicans, and though their divergence of views on DEI originate before the start of the first Trump administration, the conflict has escalated during the president’s second term.
DEI efforts date back to the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, when the Freedmen’s Bureau was established to assist formerly enslaved Black Americans and give them a fairer chance at educational, financial and social success in American society. More recent, high-profile examples of racial injustice and unequal opportunity for people of color — such as the murder of Black Minnesota man George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer, and Supreme Court’s recission of affirmative action policies on college campuses in 2023 — resulted in public demand for corporate and institutional commitments to treating all Americans fairly. 
“Diversity, equity and inclusion are not threats. They are tools of fairness,” Wilder said. “They’re grounded in the constitutional values that shape this country and its commonwealth. What threatens us, what really threatens us, is unchecked power.”
However, Republicans argue that DEI initiatives present cultural, ideological and political problems. Chief among the concerns is the threat of placing a person’s identity over achievements when determining their qualifications, and “reverse discrimination,” which they say puts the majority at a disadvantage.
UVA’s governing board was the first in the commonwealth to dissolve its DEI initiatives, but it was not enough to avoid involvement from the Trump administration. 
Youngkin’s administration has also confronted DEI efforts by renaming the state Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion through an executive order — replacing “equity” with “opportunity,” contrary to state code — and eliminating DEI-driven education programs at the Virginia Department of Education through an executive order designed to remove “divisive concepts” in school curriculum.
 Independence vs accountability

Through their actions this year, Senate Democrats have tried to enforce the principles governing board members must follow, including understanding fiduciary duties, commitment to independent institutional governance, and a pledge to avoid excessive partisan inclinations.
This manifested on June 9, when the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee rejected several of Youngkin’s appointments to governing boards. Youngkin’s administration has challenged these, claiming that appointments can still serve until the entire General Assembly reconvenes.
The contention set the state for a lawsuit and court hearing on Friday to decide whether leaders at Virginia Military Institute, the University of Virginia, and George Mason University broke the rules by allowing rejected appointees to remain on their governing boards.

The legislators are asking the court to bar the contested board members from continuing to serve and declare that any board member who permits them to remain is violating their legal duties. Among the rejected appointments were GOP stalwarts, including former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, a former deputy secretary of Homeland Security with the first Trump administration, and former state commerce and trade secretary Caren Merrick.
On July 10, Senate Democratic leaders asked the Senate to sign a letter supporting Virginia’s higher education institutions and institutional independence. In response, Republicans refuted the letter’s intention.
“Today’s press conference was silent on the real issue: a formal federal Title VI investigation into George Mason’s handling of race-based complaints, including nearly forty reports tied to antisemitic harassment last fall,” said House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, in a statement to the Mercury. “This isn’t politics. It’s civil rights law asking: Were complaints processed, investigated, supported, or ignored? Fighting antisemitism isn’t a pretext. Oversight isn’t partisan. It’s accountability.”
In a July 11 statement, Senate Republican leaders also addressed the matter, expressing concern that Democrats are attempting to shield higher education institutions from any form of public accountability while simultaneously politicizing board appointments and weaponizing the courts against college leaders.
Republicans also emphasized that while academic freedom is a “core value,” state government oversight and accountability are not only appropriate but essential.
“We strongly support academic excellence and freedom of inquiry,” Senate Republican Caucus Chairman Mark Obenshain, R-Harrisonburg, said in a statement. “But there’s nothing improper about ensuring that our public universities reflect the values and priorities of the people of Virginia. That’s not interference—that’s representative government.”
“Our institutions deserve better than this performative double standard,” Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, said. “Virginia’s students and families are watching—and they know the difference between real leadership and political theater.”
 The path forward

Democratic leaders acknowledged that while they cannot control the federal government’s actions, they do have some options for the challenges facing Virginia’s higher education landscape, including reconsidering legislation to support governing boards that could help address the gubernatorial appointment process.

One idea is for the legislature to reconsider a proposal from last year’s session that Youngkin vetoed. The proposal would have redefined the authority of governing boards within public universities regarding their legal affairs. The proposal would have allowed the boards to manage independent legal counsel. It also clarified that the state attorney general’s involvement in legal matters would be limited to instances where their services are specifically requested.
Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, said since Youngkin took office the administration’s plan has been to reform institutions and remake governing boards to align them with conservative ideals, pointing to Attorney General Jason Miyares firing the attorneys at UVA and George Mason.
“There’s been a deliberate coordinated effort to get this done at the very beginning,” Surovell said.
Lawmakers are also considering amendments to the state code that specifies gubernatorial appointments cannot take effect until they are confirmed by the General Assembly, typically in January. 
Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said he is pondering proposing a study and forming a select joint committee to better understand the history of the governing boards.
“We have a responsibility, I think, as we move forward, to put in some guardrails,” Scott said. “I think to do that we need the public support (and) we need to let them know what’s happening now, so when we do make these changes, they’ll understand why we had to do it.”

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)As Virginia weighs whether or not to enshrine reproductive health in its constitution, the issue is playing a significant role in the upcoming elections for governor and motivating voters across party lines — including some who say it’s reshaping how they plan to vote this fall. 
That includes Salem-area resident Mauricia Smith, a longtime Republican voter who now plans to support Democrats in this year’s elections. She was among 450 women around the state to sign onto an open letter about how reproductive rights have influenced their decision.
Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the Republican gubernatorial nominee, marked her opposition to the state’s current reproductive rights constitutional amendment this spring and participated in anti-abortion demonstrations this year. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor, has pledged to support Virginians’ access to reproductive health services, including abortion, in vitro fertilization and contraception.
Smith said she knows friends and family who have used in vitro fertilization to have children, and she said she knew a friend who chose to have an abortion after being sexually assaulted. Another friend’s daughter needed surgical intervention to safely manage a miscarriage as well, she said. Both abortion medication and an abortion-adjacent procedure called dilation and curettage are sometimes used to help prevent infection when the body begins to reject a pregnancy. 
“I just remember being so thankful that she was in Virginia and not another state where her life would have been at risk in that situation,” Smith said of the friend’s daughter. “That’s what makes reproductive rights important to me. I think they should be important to everyone.”
 Letter spells out some voters’ ‘distrust’ of Earle-Sear’ stance

The open letter, which was addressed to Earle-Sears, was initially drafted by the Democratic Party of Virginia and sent to local party organizers around the state, a spokesperson with DPVA said. 
From there, the letter circulated by word of mouth, racking up signatures and endorsements from 450 women. Smith was among the signers to jointly tell Earle-Sears that she didn’t have their vote because they “can’t trust” her to protect reproductive health. Instead, the signers have vowed to support Spanberger. 
Specifically, the letter points to Earle-Sears’ tie-breaking vote earlier this year on a right-to-contraception bill and a personal note — first reported by The Mercury — she left on Virginia’s in-progress constitutional amendment to enshrine reproductive rights. As lieutenant governor, Earle-Sears is required to sign legislation that passes. When Earle-Sears fulfilled that duty, she also left a note near her signature of the reproductive rights amendment expressing opposition to it. 
“I am morally opposed to this bill; no protection for the child,” Earle-Sears wrote above her signature.
Earle-Sears ‘morally opposed’ to Virginia’s reproductive rights amendment, note shows

Smith framed Earle-Sears’ stance on reproductive rights as extremism — an issue she said should not be partisan. Smith feels “she can’t be trusted” on the issue and it factored into her decision to back Democrats — at least for the time being. 
Abortion has been a key piece of opposition by Republicans for the reproductive rights amendment. But  since it would also enshrine protected access to fertility treatments and contraception, the open letter accuses Earle-Sears of morally opposing “healthcare that Virginia women depend on.”
If the amendment were to fail and Earle-Sears became the next governor, Smith said she wouldn’t trust her to protect reproductive rights. Republicans in the legislature have already demonstrated an array of restrictions or near-total bans they’d support. In 2023, some GOP lawmakers backed life-at-conception bills, while others favored a 15-week limit that lacked fetal anomaly exceptions, which often aren’t diagnosed until after 15 weeks.
Though Earle-Sears has yet to elaborate on her opposition to the amendment, other Republicans have made their positions clear. Their arguments have stemmed from the lack of adding note of existing state or federal laws that outline parental consent for minors or mandatory care for infants when born. 
But a key sticking point for Republicans has been their belief that the amendment could allow abortion to the “moment of birth” — for which infanticide is illegal — or that removing the three-phycsian threshold for approval of later abortions would make the procedure too easy to access.
More access, less cost: Spanberger lays out health care plans if she wins Virginia governorship

When Earle-Sears first ran for lieutenant governor in 2021, she called abortion “genocide” and opposed the procedure in all cases — except when a pregnant person’s life was in danger. But weeks before the election, she scrubbed most anti-abortion language from her campaign website after previously vowing to “do everything in my power” to stop abortions in Virginia. 
While her language about abortion has not been so strongly-worded during her current campaign, she has lent her support to abortion opponents as a featured speaker at the Virginia March For Life. The annual event brings various anti-abortion advocacy groups, religious leaders and thousands of Virginians together.
Earle-Sears’ campaign did not follow through by the time of this publication when asked if she wanted to elaborate further on her opposition to the amendment as it stands or if there were language adjustments to it she might support. Her campaign also did not respond to requests for comment on the open letter. 
 Virginia ballot casters’ shifting sentiments on sexual health access 

Though Virginia doesn’t have party registration for voting, Smith shared a screenshot of her voting history through Virginia Department of Elections’ citizen portal that shows she has historically voted for Republicans. 
This year, however, isn’t Smith’s first embracing a Democrat, as she said sometimes certain issues transcend partisanship. Despite voting in a GOP presidential primary in 2008, she eventually backed Democrat Barack Obama later that year — a “man of character,” she said. 
She has never voted for President Donald Trump in his three presidential campaigns, choosing third party or Democratic candidates instead. 
That is, Smith said, because of her frustration with Trump’s grip over the party she most often aligns with on other issues. 
Earlier this month, the GOP majority in Congress —  despite inter-party disagreements — passed the Trump-backed “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” by his self-imposed July 4 deadline, a move that the nonpartisan congressional budget office warned would raise the federal deficit by $3.4 trillion. 
Looming changes to Medicaid could eventually make health care access more challenging for an estimated 10 million people nationwide, including reproductive health services. Forthcoming changes to hospital funding mechanisms are also expected to create financial strain and potential cuts to services, hospital associations have warned. 
As states across the political spectrum have approved ballot referendums to constitutionally protect abortions or other reproductive healthcare access, Virginia Democrats are hoping the idea can resonate beyond party lines in the commonwealth. 
That means voters who want to see — or stop —  a ballot referendum by next November, might have this issue top of mind going into this fall’s elections. 
Smith said she hopes voters won’t choose their next governor or state delegate based solely on party affiliation, but instead make their decisions based on the issues that matter most to them.

Homicides and several other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, dropped during the first half of 2025 across 42 U.S. cities, continuing a downward trend that began in 2022, according to a new crime trends report released Thursday by the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
Homicides fell 17% in the first half of 2025, compared with the same period in 2024, among the 30 cities that reported homicide data, according to the report.
During that same period, five cities saw increases in homicide — ranging from 6% in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to 39% in Little Rock, Arkansas.
  The Council on Criminal Justice report shows declining violent crime rates in three Virginia cities: Norfolk, Richmond and Virginia Beach, from February 2018 to June 2025. (Chart courtesy the Council on Criminal Justice)
While the report’s authors say the continued drop in violent crime — especially homicides — is encouraging, they note that much of the decline stems from a few major cities with historically high rates, such as Baltimore and St. Louis.
More than half of the cities studied have higher homicide rates than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, though, the analysis found that there were 14% fewer homicides during the first half of 2025 compared to the same period in 2019.
The authors say more research is needed before crediting any specific policy or practice for the continued drop in violent crime.
The group’s findings come as President Donald Trump continues to amplify concerns about crime, at times citing misleading statistics and narratives.

In a Truth Social post earlier this week, Trump claimed that cashless bail — a practice that allows people charged with a crime to be released pretrial without paying money, unless a judge deems them a threat to public safety — were fueling a national crime surge and endangering law enforcement.
He wrote: “Crime in American Cities started to significantly rise when they went to CASHLESS BAIL. The WORST criminals are flooding our streets and endangering even our great law enforcement officers. It is a complete disaster, and must be ended, IMMEDIATELY!”
Some research suggests that setting money bail isn’t effective in ensuring court appearances or improving public safety. Opponents of ending cash bail often raise concerns that released suspects might commit new, potentially more serious crimes. While that is possible in individual cases, studies show that eliminating cash bail does not lead to a widespread increase in crime.
The Truth Social post also marked a sharp shift from Trump’s remarks during a June roundtable with the Fraternal Order of Police, where he claimed the national murder rate had “plummeted by 28%” since he took office — a figure that overstates the decline and overlooks the fact that murder rates began falling well before he returned to office.
According to data consulting firm AH Datalytics, which manages the Real-Time Crime Index — a free tool that collects crime data from more than 400 law enforcement agencies nationwide — the number of homicides between January and May 2025 was 20.3% lower than the same period in 2024.
Similarly, data released in May by the Major Cities Chiefs Association showed that homicides fell roughly 20% in the first quarter of 2025 compared with the first three months of the prior year. The group’s data is based on a survey of 68 major metropolitan police departments nationwide.
Researchers at the Council on Criminal Justice note in their report that it’s difficult to pinpoint a single reason for the drop in homicides, but they note that fewer people appear to be exposed to high-risk situations, such as robberies.
Most major crimes fell in the first half of 2025 compared with the same period last year, according to the council’s report.
Motor vehicle thefts dropped by 25%, while reported gun assaults fell 21%. Robberies, residential and non-residential burglaries, shoplifting, and aggravated and sexual assaults also saw double-digit declines
Drug offenses held steady, while domestic violence reports rose slightly — by about 3%. Carjackings declined 24% and larcenies were down 5%.
Compared with the first half of 2019, before the pandemic and nationwide reckoning over racial justice and policing, overall homicides are down 14%, robberies by 30%, and sexual assaults by 28%.
Still, more than 60% of the cities in the council’s study sample report homicide rates that remain above 2019 levels.
Motor vehicle theft remains the only crime tracked in the report that is still elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels — up 25% since 2019 — although it has declined sharply since 2023.
The council also released another analysis on the lethality of violent crime, showing that while violent incidents have decreased, the share of violence that ends in death has increased significantly. In 1994, there were 2 homicides per 1,000 assaults and about 16 per 1,000 robberies. By 2020, those figures rose to 7.2 and 55.8, respectively.",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2220769383.jpg,,,2025-07-25 05:56:17.007223

While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for the same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.

The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.










The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling.


– Oregon Republican state Rep. Cyrus Javadi


Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.

Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.

Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

(Photo by Jnaiah Price)Twenty-eight-year-old Michaela Bonner has been working 12-hour shifts as an emergency medical technician in Norfolk, Virginia, for the past four years, while attending and paying for college to finish her prerequisites for medical school.
But now that President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending law bars students from borrowing more than $50,000 annually in unsubsidized federal loans for medical school, Bonner is worried her dream of becoming a doctor is financially out of reach.
“I get told, ‘Well, we really need you. We have a physician shortage, and you’ve done all this work leading up to this point,’ and that’s true as well, and it’s not that I want to quit,” Bonner said in a recent interview. “But there are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can’t take out the full cost of living through loans.”
The tax and spending law includes provisions that significantly alter the student loan process for higher education. The law halts current student loan repayment plans for loans that are granted on or after July 1, 2026. On that date, the law also terminates Grad PLUS loans, which have helped people pay for their higher education degrees and total cost of attendance. Current borrowers will be grandfathered in.
The federal law gives current borrowers enrolled in loan repayment plans for students based on income — such as those plans known as SAVE or IBR — until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. Interest collection will resume Aug. 1 for students enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan.
At the same time, medical or law school students hoping to get unsubsidized federal loans — in which the borrower is responsible for paying the interest at all times rather than the government — will only be able to borrow $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in areas such as history or philosophy have a $100,000 lifetime cap.










There are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can't take out the full cost of living through loans.


– Michaela Bonner, aspiring medical student


The average yearly cost of medical school for the 2024-25 academic year ranged from around $42,000 to $72,000, depending on whether the school was private or public and whether the student was a resident or nonresident, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Some congressional Republicans say that students need to be working harder to pay for higher education, like medical school, on their own. Others say the caps put the onus back on colleges and universities to rein in the rising cost of tuition. But critics of this legislation say the loan caps are only going to harm students, especially from lower-income backgrounds, and will exacerbate physician shortages.
In recent years states have tried to ease physician shortages by implementing various policy solutions. Since 2023, at least nine states have made it easier for doctors trained in other countries to get medical licenses. States have also participated in interstate licensing compacts, allowing nurses and physician assistants to travel across state lines to work, so long as they are licensed in one state within the compact.
For student loan relief, more than 20 states have enacted legislation to address student loan forgiveness, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a group that tracks states policies. Georgia passed a measure that will expand a cancelable loan program for physicians working in rural and underserved areas. Idaho also created the Rural Nursing Loan Repayment Program, offering nurses $25,000 in forgivable loans after three years of service in a rural area.
States are making it easier for physician assistants to work across state lines

McKenzie Richards, a health care policy fellow at the conservative think tank Cicero Institute who has been studying the pace of physician shortages, told Stateline that the national physician shortage could potentially exceed 100,000 by 2034. At the end of 2024 that projected number was closer to 64,000 physicians.
Richards said states will be looking toward more policy solutions should the student loan changes exacerbate physician shortages.
“We know what’s going to be happening coming down the line in just five years, so I think policies that states can adopt to get out of this are really important to be looking at now,” she said.
“The hope is that by capping [federal loans], it will encourage schools to lower tuition prices,” Richards added. “Then maybe they need to be admitting more students, which would have a great downstream effect for getting more doctors through.”
Other students will be in the same boat, said Lesley Turner, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Chicago and an economist.
“This is going to hit some students worse than others,” Turner told Stateline. “Those [students] in more expensive programs tend to borrow more, and so for those students they will need to return to private student loans or other ways of financing their graduate education.”
Many students were already questioning their capacity to go to medical school before the student loan caps, said Shannon Jimenez, dean of the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine.
“I expect that this bill, this cap, is going to push people out of primary care and into specialties to help pay off those higher interest rate loans,” Jimenez told Stateline. She added that caps will likely deter students from lower socioeconomic statuses from going into primary care — important in places like Arkansas, where she says there is a “maldistribution of physicians.”
“Many schools like us try to attract those students, because they’re more likely to go into primary care and serve in underserved areas. So it’s going to tie our hands in a lot of ways.”
Amid mental health crisis, new compact allows social workers to practice across state lines

Large states and more rural states will feel the gaps more deeply, said Richards, of the Cicero Institute. Louisiana, for example, is projected to be short almost 5,000 doctors from a variety of specialties by 2030, including close to 400 primary care doctors. Already more than a third of Louisiana physicians are close to retirement age — similar to the situation in neighboring Arkansas.
As for whether schools will just be able to lower tuition, Jimenez said, “it makes no sense.”
“We still function in a somewhat market-driven economy and have to compete with other schools around us, so our cost is based mostly on what we have to pay our faculty, and that’s not going to go down,” she said. The annual cost of attendance at her school is between $80,000 and $85,000.
Bonner, the EMT, holds a political communications degree from Regent University and now is studying biomedical sciences at Old Dominion University. She already has $20,000 in loans, she said, and for the rest of college tuition, she has paid out of pocket. Since she’s supporting herself, she hasn’t been able to save much.
She’d planned to take the medical school entrance exam next spring, but now worries about how she’d pay for living expenses while attending. “Medical school scheduling doesn’t allow for working, so you have to take out loans for living expenses,” she said.
“A lot of people, I feel, would be panicked if you had worked for eight to 10 years of your life and found out that all the systems that you were banking on in a really academically challenging space are disappearing,” Bonner said.
“I don’t see a path forward for certain, but I’m fighting to make one.”

(U.S. Army Corps of Engineers photo by Michael Davis)North Carolina is taking bids to draw up a plan to keep domestic violence programs and services widely available after hurricanes.
A state contract request, posted Tuesday, asks bidders to create a “comprehensive, survivor-centered” plan and materials for shelters and service providers in North Carolina’s storm-prone regions.
The goal, state officials say, is to combine disaster planning with widespread resources and avoid an uptick in domestic violence that is often observed after hurricanes and severe storms.
“Survivors are impacted in a lot of the same ways that other people are from natural disasters, and then some,” said Danielle Carman, executive director of the state’s Council for Women & Youth Involvement. “They have special safety needs, and special safety risks, particularly if they’re in an active abusive relationship.”
Research has indicated that violence against women and children increases in the wake of natural disasters. The logistical challenges of disaster recovery — increased stressors, shelter housing, and in severe cases, damaged infrastructure and restricted travel — make resources scarcer.
North Carolina saw one such severe case after Hurricane Helene, which devastated the western mountains and cut off remote communities for weeks.
But the federal money that will fund the new state plan actually came as a response to prior hurricanes, Fiona and Ian, which hit the eastern coast. Around $833,000 was sent to the state to both pay off lingering damages and draw up the preparation plan, said Carman.
The winning bidder will be responsible for a written toolkit that includes region-specific resources, guidance on early action, and scenarios and strategies based on storm severity. They’ll also conduct a statewide survey with providers, according to the state’s contract request.
State officials are working with the North Carolina Coalition Against Domestic Violence for subject matter expertise on domestic violence issues. The bid winner should have “in-depth knowledge” of the state and of disaster planning.
Bids open for the plan on Aug. 14, with state officials planning to have a contract inked by October. From there, the project will run until fall 2027, Carman said.
“They would have a two-year period both to work on the plan and hopefully do a lot of consulting with providers around the state about their needs,” she said. “Do some focus groups with those folks, roll out a plan and then work with the coalition to provide training, technical assistance and resources around implementation.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hurricane-Helene-debris-Army-Corps-photo3-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-25 05:56:17.007223

The decision would cap more than a year of proceedings over Eversource’s initial $182 million rate request, which the utility scaled back multiple times under pressure from ratepayer advocates. It comes as residential rates are set to rise Aug. 1 from 8.9 cents per kilowatt-hour to 11.2 cents per kilowatt-hour, which would mean an increase of $13.61, or 9.9%, to the bill of an average home using 600 kilowatt-hours of electricity a month, according to Eversource.
But consumer groups say the bigger concern is Eversource’s proposal to abandon traditional rate regulation in favor of a “performance-based” system they argue would shift the financial risk from shareholders to consumers.
The proposed performance-based ratemaking (PBR) system would allow Eversource to avoid filing detailed rate cases until 2029, instead receiving automatic annual adjustments based on economic formulas. Critics say this would reduce the regulatory scrutiny that currently requires utilities to justify their spending and demonstrate they’re operating efficiently.
AARP New Hampshire, which represents 212,000 members statewide, has been one of the most vocal opponents. The organization warns in a June brief that the performance-based formula “is so complex that it is likely that, under a future PBR plan, only a few individuals in the state would even be able to explain how rates are set.”
“It’s kind of a misnomer to call it performance-based,” said Christina FitzPatrick, AARP’s state director. “They’re saying if we do these other things then we will get a rate increase and those things aren’t tied to the performance and the experience of the customer.”
The concern reflects a broader problem with such regulatory systems: Utilities possess far more knowledge about their actual costs and capabilities than regulators do. It’s like switching from itemized billing to a flat monthly fee; while simpler on the surface, it can create incentives to cut corners on things customers can’t easily measure.
Eversource is seeking a 10.3% return on equity, well above the 8.13% that the New Hampshire Office of the Consumer Advocate says is appropriate. The difference translates to millions in annual costs embedded in customer’s bills, according to Consumer Advocate Donald Kreis, who represents ratepayers in utility proceedings.
Kreis noted that utility shareholders often receive returns exceeding 10%, while typical personal investments yield 6-7% annually, a gap he attributes to weak regulatory oversight.
“Even 8.1% is like free money for them,” Kreis told the Bulletin.
The utility also proposes boosting the fixed monthly residential charge from $13.81 to $19.81 — a 43.4% jump that AARP says would disproportionately harm low-usage customers, many of whom are seniors on fixed incomes. 
“People aged 50 and over are more vulnerable to increases in energy prices, as these consumers devote a higher percentage of their total spending towards residential energy costs than do other age groups,” AARP argued in its brief. The consumer advocate’s office noted that low-usage customers have limited ability to reduce their bill further, making the shift to higher fixed charges particularly problematic. 
Central to PBR is what’s called a “K-Bar” mechanism that would allow automatic recovery of capital investment costs based on rolling three-year averages. Under Eversource’s proposal, the utility could recover capital costs up to 10% above its forecasted annual capital spending — essentially giving the company a buffer to exceed its planned investment levels without regulatory review. Consumer advocates argue this abandons the traditional “prudency review” process that protects ratepayers by requiring utilities to justify major expenditures before recovering costs. The mechanism could violate state law prohibiting utilities from earning returns on construction work in progress, critics say. 
FitzPatrick called the overall performance-based plan “super complicated” and said it would essentially guarantee utility returns while “minimizing their downside risk” — a combination that she argues is inappropriate for a regulated monopoly.
The Conservation Law Foundation expressed conditional support in filings, saying it could deliver “rate stability for customers; greater cost control incentives; improved administrative efficiency; and increased transparency for service quality and reliability” if properly designed. However, CLF recommended modifications, including establishing an annual review process for capital additions and eliminating the proposed 10% variance mechanism.
Consumer advocates have reserved the right to seek rehearing within 30 days of any commission order and have requested the commission defer any new permanent rates if it approves increases, allowing time for potential appeals.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/electricitylines-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-25 05:56:17.007223

He later served as a Muslim chaplain at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital after coming to the United States in 2014 and seeking asylum. It was granted in 2018, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported.
That asylum was suddenly revoked on June 3 over supposed ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, which the United States has not designated a terrorist group. 
After the cancellation of a July 3 hearing in immigration court on Soliman’s loss of asylum status, ICE arrested him on July 9 and took him to Butler County Jail in Hamilton.
To stop ICE from whisking the 51-year-old out of the country, U.S. District Judge Michael Barrett on July 15 issued a temporary restraining order keeping Soliman in Ohio. On Thursday, Barrett extended the order at least until July 30.
After a bail hearing before an immigration judge on Tuesday, Soliman’s legal team accused the Trump administration of a blatant bait-and-switch as it tried to deport their client.
Robert Ratliff, Soliman’s attorney, said that the original “charge of removability” — the basis the government gave to deport Soliman — was material support of terrorism. 
Now it’s stopped making the claim for that purpose. But it’s still making it to argue that the immigration court judge doesn’t have jurisdiction to release Soliman on bail, Ratliff said. 
If the immigration judge doesn’t have jurisdiction to grant bail, no one does, the attorney said.
“The amended charges no longer make that (support-of-terrorism) accusation,” Ratliff said during the press conference. “The government, however, is still holding to that accusation for purposes of jurisdiction in the bond case.”

Immigration judges are not part of the judiciary. Instead, they’re appointed by the U.S. Justice Department, and thus part of the same branch of government as the agency that Trump tasked with deporting millions.
 Immigrant advocates say the arrangement is inherently unjust.
However that may be, an immigration judge in Cleveland delayed a decision on Soliman’s bond until July 29 because government lawyers made a lengthy new filing just before Tuesday’s hearing. 
There wasn’t much in it that was new, Ratliff said. And the government is again using academic articles to “support” its claims even though their authors say the articles they wrote do not, he added.
“The extensive brief that (the government) filed today — some 140 pages about an hour or so before the hearing — contains some of the same articles that were previously cited by the asylum officer in his decision (to remove Soliman) — articles about which we submitted letters from the authors of those articles who dispute the findings of the asylum officer, that dispute the fact that their articles were used in this way, and dispute the suppositions the government came to citing their articles.”
A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment on the matter. 
But Franchel Daniel, an attorney with the Muslim Legal Fund of America, said the Trump administration is looking for any excuse to deport Soliman, who has broad community support in Cincinnati.
“The fact that the government would raise these types of allegations against him is just ludicrous,” she said. “They continue to make unfounded allegations, and they haven’t given any support whatsoever. It’s been a massive game of six degrees of separation — how can we connect you to somebody so we can connect them to something else?”
Egyptian police arrested Soliman over his work as a journalist during the Arab Spring more than a decade ago. Then Covington, Ky., police arrested two Cincinnati reporters last week as they covered a protest of Soliman’s detention.
CityBeat reporter Madeline Fening and photo intern Lucas Griffith were arrested as they covered about 100 protesters who marched from a vigil for Soliman in Cincinnati and across the John A. Roebling Bridge into Kentucky. Protesters marched in the travel lanes, obstructing traffic.
The two journalists and 13 others were swept up in arrests that began about 20 seconds after police gave the order to disburse, the Enquirer reported. Fening and Griffith were charged with felony rioting even though videos posted online seem to show only police engaging in violence. 
One officer repeatedly punched a protester about the head as another took the man to the ground and handcuffed him. The protester did not appear to be resisting.
“As previously stated, the officer in question was placed on administrative duty and we have opened an extensive investigation regarding our agency’s response to the unlawful disturbance on the Roebling Bridge,” a spokesman for the Covington Police Department said in an email. “We hold our officers to the highest standard. If any misconduct is identified, it will be addressed.”
The spokesman didn’t respond to questions about the felony arrest of the two journalists. Prosecutors dropped the felony charges Wednesday, but Fening and Griffith are still accused of misdemeanors.
While Covington police won’t explain why they arrested journalists in the protest, Children’s Hospital isn’t addressing claims by two of its chaplains who said they were fired for speaking out on Soliman’s behalf. The Enquirer reported the claims on Thursday.
Asked for comment, a spokesperson for the hospital said in an email, “We don’t comment on current or former personnel.” The spokesperson didn’t respond immediately when asked whether Children’s Hospital believed chaplains’ public speech regarding the controversial deportation of a former chaplain who is an asylee is merely a personnel issue.
As the furor grows over the attempted deportation of Soliman, his attorney said much more than his fate is at stake. 
If Soliman can be deported on makeshift claims that he supported the Muslim Brotherhood, authorities can make similar claims against any asylee, Ratliff said.
“The procedures in this case, the procedures used by (the Department of Homeland Security) are broader than one group, one man, one entity,” he said. “If this policy, this procedure, is allowed to stand, anybody who fled any of the violence in Central or South America can now find themselves charged under the same (material-support accusation) for something in those countries as routine as paying extortion demands or paying war tax or things of that nature. So this is a process that if it’s successful in this case… it can be used to revoke any immigration visa.”

(Photo by Susan J. Demas/Michigan Advance)With the looming cuts to Medicaid funding set forth by both the federal government and New Hampshire’s state budget, it has become clear that access to Medicaid will become more difficult for Granite Staters. 
Medicaid is a vital program that provides medical coverage for low-income people and people with disabilities. In New Hampshire, approximately 13% of Granite Staters and 30% of New Hampshire’s children were enrolled in Medicaid — translating to over 180,000 people. 
New logistical barriers — such as the imposition of a work requirements, new premiums for people who earn more money than the federal poverty level, higher co-pays, and more frequent recertification — will also serve as other mechanisms that serve only to add bureaucratic barriers for access to Medicaid. 
The federal government’s proposed cuts to Medicaid funding of $1 trillion over the next decade could prove to be untenable for all Americans who rely on Medicaid. In all states, including New Hampshire, this will likely lead to many people losing Medicaid coverage. For example, as the federal poverty level is set at $15,360 and the average monthly cost of an apartment in New Hampshire being nearly a tenth of that, new premiums could make it impossible for low-income Granite Staters to access Medicaid coverage. This would then likely result in losing access to necessary medical care, and the need to delay or forgo medical care in order to avoid unaffordable medical bills. 
As a rural state, the consequences for New Hampshire could prove especially devastating. 
At a high level, rural hospitals and clinics often rely heavily on Medicaid reimbursements. Cuts to Medicaid funding could lead to closure of some of these vital rural health care resources. Furthermore, Medicaid helps to support medical schools or physician residency training programs, so losing Medicaid funding could ultimately lead to fewer physicians. These factors could ultimately make access to health care in New Hampshire even more difficult to obtain, especially in the most rural parts of the state.
On an individual level, if Granite Staters lose Medicaid coverage and choose to forgo preventive medical care as a result, this may shift care away from outpatient settings and toward emergency departments. This may also mean that by the time people choose to seek medical care, they may be sicker and will not have had care that could have prevented new illness or progression of existing illness. 
Certain populations, such as those with mental health care needs, may be especially vulnerable. 
Our state has been making progress toward meeting the 2019 New Hampshire 10-Year Mental Health Plan goal of ending the need for patients to board in emergency departments while awaiting inpatient mental health care. However, the loss of Medicaid coverage would likely reverse the hard-fought progress and cause more patients to seek mental health care in emergency departments — ultimately worsening the phenomenon of mental health boarding in emergency departments.
In recent history, our state’s Legislature has recognized the value of Medicaid, enacting Medicaid expansion through the Granite Advantage Health Care Program in 2014. Medicaid expansion has consistently demonstrated improved access to care and improved health outcomes for enrollees, and in New Hampshire Medicaid expansion has had bipartisan support when it has come under threat. 
As a specific example, Medicaid coverage for addiction treatment has been a critical component of our state’s response to the opioid epidemic. In this case, the access to treatment for substance use disorders that Medicaid provided led to many more people getting necessary care that likely prevented many overdose deaths in our state. If treatment centers closed due to lack of funding, and fewer people had access to coverage through Medicaid, it is certain that the number of overdose deaths in New Hampshire will increase. 
As a physician, I know that reducing barriers to medical care is important for our state’s health. Being able to access the right care at the right time is a key indicator of a healthy population. 
Cuts to Medicaid funding mean more than just the dollars and cents — they mean many people in New Hampshire will lose access to care, while rural hospitals and clinics may be forced to close their doors. 
As access to and affordability of health care worsen, the financial and human cost will be one that we all pay.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/emergencyentrance-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-25 05:56:17.007223

The recent federal announcement of a freeze on projects that help states use their Medicaid programs to suit the needs of their residents could have an impact on future projects in Ohio.
In the most recent state budget, one such project was nearly taken off the table, one that would ask the federal government to authorize continuous enrollment for Medicaid-eligible children younger than age three.
The federal Social Security Act allows the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services to approve pilot projects, also called “demonstrations,” to give each state individual discretion to tailor the Medicaid program to the residents’ needs.
“These demonstrations give states additional flexibility to design and improve their Medicaid programs, and to demonstrate and evaluate state-specific policy approaches to better serve Medicaid beneficiaries,” according to a July 17 letter signed by Drew Snyder, listed as deputy administrator and director for the U.S. Center for Medicaid & CHIP Services.
CHIP is the Children’s Health Insurance Program which can provide coverage through Medicaid and through separate CHIP programs in some states.
That letter served as notification to states that the federal agency would be putting potential new pilot programs on hold in an effort to save money.
“This shift in approach reflects the agency’s commitment to preserving these vital programs for the most vulnerable Americans and being good stewards of taxpayer dollars,” the letter stated.
As of Jan. 1, 2024, federal law required states to provide a year’s worth of continuous eligibility for children younger than 19 in both Medicaid and CHIP, whether or not their eligibility had changed in that time.
The American Rescue Plan also created an option for states to allow Medicaid and CHIP participants 12 months of continuous eligibility for “extended postpartum coverage.”
According to federal data, 242,625 children were enrolled in CHIP as of March 2025. More than 1.2 million children in Ohio are enrolled in both Medicaid and CHIP.
Because the pilot programs that some states, including Ohio, have requested approval for can expand eligibility “to additional populations as well as to increase the length of time that individuals could stay enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP,” the department said there were “concerns about the appropriateness” of continuing such pilot programs.
“By keeping potentially otherwise ineligible individuals enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP, this expanded continuous eligibility could lead to increased costs to states and the federal government,” the letter to states read.
The federal Medicaid program as a whole is preparing for cuts due to passage of the federal reconciliation bill just signed by President Donald Trump earlier this month.
The overall Medicaid cuts will impact Ohioans young and old who rely on the program for their health insurance.
In addition to the letter, the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services said it would conduct “direct outreach to states with existing expanded continuous eligibility authority to emphasize that this authority is time-limited.”
The Ohio Department of Medicaid’s website notes that CHIP is operated as an expansion of the state’s Medicaid plan, rather than as a separate entity.
Ohio’s Medicaid program currently covers 2 in 5 children ages 18 and younger, with more than 375,000 children ages 0 to 5 enrolled, according to analysis by the Center for Community Solutions using data from March 2025.

While a spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Medicaid said the agency “does not currently have programs related to (The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services’) recent communications regarding continuous eligibility,” the ODM and Gov. Mike DeWine’s administration “are working with partners including CMS to align with federal requirements.”
“ODM is still assessing the impact of these changes,” said Stephanie O’Grady, deputy director and chief communications officer at the department, in a statement.
The state has applied for various types of waivers through the Social Security Act’s pilot project authority over the years, including one to include a “pre-enrollment requirement” to the state’s Medicaid expansion group.
That request is still pending, according to a U.S. Department of Medicare & Medicaid Services database.
Another such waiver request was for “multi-year continuous eligibility for children,” in which the state Medicaid department requested the move to comply with the previous General Assembly’s budget bill.
The budget required the state agency to “provide continuous Medicaid enrollment for children from birth through three years of age,” according to the waiver application.
“Preventive care, treatment for physical and behavioral health conditions and early childhood screenings are essential to setting children up for success and building a foundation to support their health and well-being through the rest of their lives,” the application stated.
The Health Policy Institute of Ohio said research showed between 2022 and 2023, 14.4% of Ohio children ages 0 to 5 did not have a preventative care visit over the course of the year.
The pilot program proposed by the state would last from Oct. 2025 through Sept. 2030, and allow certain children in that age group who are eligible for Medicaid to remain eligible for 48 months or until the end of the month in which they turn four, whichever comes first.
The state Medicaid department said goals of the pilot program would be to minimize coverage gaps to allow for consistent care and screenings, decrease the need for “higher-cost services associated with delaying care” and “easing the stress and burden on families and caregivers as they navigate Medicaid coverage,” along with reducing administrative costs.
In the most recent state operating budget, legislators tried to eliminate that provision within state law that required the Medicaid department to ask for the continuous enrollment waiver.
Gov. Mike DeWine vetoed the move at the end of June as he finalized the state operating budget for the next two years, keeping the requirement in place.
The federal decision to hold off on the projects like the state’s continuous enrollment proposal could mean long term issues, particularly for already struggling households.
“This waiver offered the potential to help alleviate existing gaps in care access for young children in Ohio, which can improve health and prevent illness later in life,” Brian O’Rourke, a health care policy analyst with the Health Policy Institute of Ohio, told the Capital Journal. “With the recently announced plan by CMS to deny these waivers, these access issues will likely persist and potentially even grow over time, especially for low-income families.”

Over the last 87 years – particularly during the 20th Century – few innovations in the American economy have done more to lift up average people than the minimum wage.
As it was first conceived and applied, the federal minimum wage law assured that a person who worked full-time was paid enough to support their family. And for many decades, the minimum wage actually worked that way.
Unfortunately, in recent decades—thanks to opposition from the political right – the federal minimum wage has remained mired at the absurdly inadequate level of seven dollars and twenty-five cents per hour. Indeed, it was 16 years ago today that it was raised to that level.
And while many states and cities have gone ahead and raised their minimum wages to much higher levels in recent years, in most others – including North Carolina – it’s still legal to pay the pitiful sum of seven-twenty-five an hour.
The bottom line: It’s long past time to once again make the minimum wage a living wage, and the failure of Congress and the North Carolina legislature to do so is simply inexcusable.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.
The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland, and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana, and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.
Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.
Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.
Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

Mike DeWine is emphasizing the importance of funding and supporting schools as Ohio House lawmakers continue to consider overriding his vetoes.
The latest Republican infighting started when the governor shut down several budget provisions that the GOP says would provide property tax relief.
The fallout from the Ohio House’s override of one of DeWine’s vetoes on Monday has landed at the executive’s feet.
“We have to fund our schools,” the governor said Wednesday. “We have to fund our mental health in the state.”
In the two-year state operating budget, DeWine vetoed restrictions on the ability to put emergency levies on the ballot or request an increase to a current levy.
That provision eliminated levy replacements on property taxes for all political subdivisions. For schools, it would have prohibited them from imposing a fixed-sum emergency levy, a substitute emergency levy and a combined school district income tax and fixed-sum property tax levy.
But the Ohio House narrowly passed an override on the provision, 61-28, just clearing the threshold of 60 votes.
All Democrats present voted against it, and they were joined by Republican state Rep. Scott Oelslager. Former Speaker Jason Stephens, R-Kitts Hill, didn’t come back for the override session, but if he did, said he would vote no.
On Monday, Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, explained why he’s seeking to override vetoes.
“(Voters) don’t quite know what they’re voting on,” Huffman claimed, “because everybody wants to ‘Vote yes for the kids,’ but later on they find out how high their taxes went.”
Huffman also claimed the GOP, minus DeWine, is aiming to immediately provide property tax relief, which is why the speaker also wants to override two other vetoes. However, he was unable to get the votes to override them.
DeWine removed a provision that would have allowed county budget commissions to unilaterally take money away from passed school levies if they find it “reasonably necessary.”
He also vetoed another that would have required that emergency and substitute tax levies, incremental growth levies, conversion levies, and the property tax portion of combined income tax and property tax levies be included in the 20-mill floor calculation for school funding purposes.
“We have to have a governor who wants to do something about this,” Huffman said, emphasizing his view that the problem is that “taxes (are) too high” while “government spending (is) too high at the local level.”
Schools have been arguing that this will require them to make massive cuts to programs, teachers and buildings — and this comes as the GOP slashed hundreds of millions of dollars from expected funding this year.
Asked if state government has an obligation to fund public schools more than it is doing in the budget, DeWine said state government is in a process and the override isn’t set in stone yet.
“The two big goals are: we have to get relief to those who really need the relief, and second, we have to continue to be able to support our schools,” he said.
Part of his solution, and a way to discourage overrides, is a new property tax working group. Made up of county auditors and superintendents, the group is set to evaluate the best policies.
“They’re going to focus for the next 60 days,” the governor said, adding that they are meeting for the first time Thursday.
The group isn’t necessary, Huffman alleged.
“I’m, I guess, flabbergasted that the governor would veto these and say, ‘Well, let’s just keep studying it,'” the speaker said.
There have been multiple property tax review groups over the past several years, but the lawmakers have not put forward any substantial relief.
“We have to do something to help those individuals in a pinpointed manner,” the governor said.
The levy override still needs to go through the Ohio Senate to take effect.
The lawmakers will likely attempt the rest of their overrides before the law goes into effect at the end of September:
Lawmakers have until the end of 2026 to override.

On a recent summer evening, some survivors of human trafficking gathered in a noisy, crowded restaurant in German Village in Columbus to show their works of art and celebrate liberation from their pasts. 
The art show sponsored by the SOAP Project — Saving Our Adolescents from Prostitution — and Barcelona restaurant featured paintings prominently displayed in spotlights on the brick walls.

The paintings were created by human trafficking survivors and Theresa Flores, SOAP’s executive director, herself a survivor.
Human sex trafficking is by no means new, but it was only made illegal in Ohio in 2011 after Teresa Fedor, then a state lawmaker, fiercely advocated for the measure. 
Since then, Ohio has strengthened the law that widely views women and girls forced into prostitution as victims not criminals, a dramatic change from the past. There have been hundreds of arrests and prosecutions under the law.
Human trafficking is traumatic and often results in life-long physical and mental health issues.
Flores said creating art for survivors “is a special component to healing because many survivors don’t have the words to use for the trauma that happened to them. But you have to get it out of you or it festers. When we do our survivor wellness retreats,” Flores said, “art is a big part of it.”
She continued: “So many times survivors will naturally lean to creative things such as painting, drawing, song writing, book writing, jewelry making and so forth to  express what is inside of them. It is therapeutic and cathartic.”
The journey to joy was a long, painful road beginning for Shayla Marshall at the age of six when her father, a wannabe music producer, began offering his four daughters to men as “party favors.” 
The horror went on for years in their home in Kalamazoo, MI., until Shayla’s mother moved her family to Columbus — without the girls’ father.
Even then, the juvenile trafficking didn’t stop because Marshall’s father moved to Columbus. It was only when Shayla’s mother armed herself that the abuse stopped.
But soul-tearing damage had been done to the girls.
“I didn’t know how to act like a person,” said Shayla. “I was so ashamed.”
But Shayla slowly recovered after “some deep therapy” and realizing that what happened to her was not her fault. Now 31, she is a registered nurse counseling people with substance abuse issues.
Sister Dee Dee, 41, as she is known in Columbus, was also sexually abused as a child, and as a young teenager lost her older brother to murder.

She became pregnant at 13 but was forced to give up her baby daughter. She eventually turned to a man who groomed her with drugs until he began trafficking her regularly.
“I had no self-esteem,” Sister Dee Dee said. “I was depressed and defeated. Until I found my purpose, I felt like I was nothing.
“I met the wrong guy. He encouraged me to try crack cocaine ‘just once.’ Just once was all it took. Instantly addicted, I ended up on the street. I learned how to prostitute myself to get money for drugs. That’s all I did every day, all day. It’s easy when you’re numb.”
Sister Dee Dee said she spent seven years on the streets, hooked on drugs and selling herself for money.
One day — Aug. 16, 2012,  her “Freedom Date” —  Sister Dee Dee turned to God and decided to change her life, she said. 
She received help and support, got sober and underwent treatment for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
Today, she operates Life Beyond the Streets, a non-profit group of peer recovery coaches whose goal is “finding freedom for women trapped in a dangerous life on the streets by addiction, homelessness and mental health issues.”
Christina Conrad, a SOAP board member, said art is lifesaving to many survivors “because sometimes there are no words for what they’ve been through and the process of how they’ve overcome.”
Scott Irish, Barcelona guest services manager, said the restaurant became interested in collaborating with SOAP both to help the nonprofit group and as a service to the community.
“I had no clue how prevalent and persuasive human trafficking is,” Irish said. “This sort of opened all our eyes. The people that do this terrible crime know exactly who to prey upon, kids from broken homes, undocumented immigrants, and others who are helpless.”
Shayla and Sister Dee Dee’s paintings, as well of those of others, were sold within 90 minutes. 
The proceeds will go to SOAP to fund survivor programs. 
The survivor artwork will be on display until Sept. 1 at the restaurant at 263 E. Whittier St. in Columbus.

On one side of the Kansas gubernatorial gladiatorial arena you have four heavyweights: the secretary of state, the insurance commissioner, the Senate president and a former governor. On the other side you have — two state senators.
That’s how the governor’s race has shaped up, more than a year before anyone in either party casts a single ballot. Republicans have dispatched an array of high-powered officials. Democrats have sent — well, those two state senators. Yet I’m not comfortable saying the GOP has a glide path to Cedar Crest.
Here’s why. Back in 2018, Republican Secretary of State Kris Kobach narrowly defeated Gov. Jeff Colyer in the primary and faced off against Democrat Laura Kelly in the general. Kelly won.
And guess what? She was a state senator.
Colyer has returned for another go-round on the Republican side. He faces Secretary of State Scott Schwab, who announced all the way back in January. Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt and Senate President Ty Masterson have followed suit in the last couple of weeks.
As a group, these candidates appear formidable. Each one has a plausible theory of victory. Colyer actually did the job after former Gov. Sam Brownback decamped to serve as the country’s religious freedom ambassador in Trump’s first term. Schwab has built a solid foundation of sane conservatism. Schmidt has proved both moderate and overwhelmingly popular among voters. And Masterson, while not the cuddliest of the candidates, has proved brutally effective in his chamber, occasionally raising hackles among fellow Republicans.
(I acknowledge that others have entered the race as well — my intent here is to focus on the best-known candidates.)
Among Democrats, the volume has proved much lower. Sen. Cindy Holscher was first to announce. She’s been an especially visible communicator among Democrats and worked with sex abuse survivors on important reforms to state law. Sen. Ethan Corson also has been especially visible to constituents and press — I receive regular email invitations to his town halls — and has been a reliable vote for Democratic priorities in his chamber. He also served as Kansas Democrats’ executive director.
Neither Holscher nor Corson have ascended to prominent places in the halls of power. They trail David Toland, the eco-devo wunderkind who serves as both lieutenant governor and commerce secretary. But Toland decided not to pursue the crown for himself.
That leaves Democrats searching for a new leader, one from a decidedly shallow bench. 
Kelly has proved over the years that she possess exceptional political talents. She does not strike voters as an extremist. She aligns with Democratic orthodoxy on most issues but manages to appear moderate and sensible no matter the national propaganda spurting from one rightwing outlet or another. Watching her these past seven years has been much like watching Evel Knievel soar above a line of school buses, effortlessly flipping the motorcycle all the while.
Will Holscher or Corson show the same political adeptness as they navigate through the coming months? I’m not sure. Each will have to expand their message beyond the comfortable confines of Johnson County to the whole state. That means answering tough questions on social issues while not alienating the activists they’ll need to knock doors down the road.
For the Republicans, any one of the four could prevail, depending on the coming months.
If the three men train their fire on one another, Schmidt might squeak through thanks to the votes of moderates who once supported Kelly. If those votes have been lost to Democrats permanently — and I wouldn’t be surprised if they have — I could see Schwab or Colyer pushing through to the general election. Masterson, to my eyes, has the most difficult path: He’s a legislative wrangler who throws elbows, and that doesn’t always appeal to the general public.
Overall, Kelly’s two terms provide the context. As one of the nation’s most popular governors, and a Democrat repeatedly elected in an red state, she’s proven the appeal of moderation. Corson, Holscher, Schmidt and Schwab (to a much lesser extent) all could carry that mantle into the election and beyond.
I don’t see a Kelly among them, though. Not yet.

Something unusual is happening in U.S. immigration courts. Government lawyers are refusing to give their names during public hearings.
In June 2025, Immigration Judge ShaSha Xu in New York City reportedly told lawyers in her courtroom: “We’re not really doing names publicly.” Only the government lawyers’ names were hidden – the immigrants’ attorneys had to give their names as usual. Xu cited privacy concerns, saying, “Things lately have changed.”
When one immigration lawyer objected that the court record would be incomplete without the government attorney’s name, Xu reportedly refused to provide it. In another case, New York immigration Judge James McCarthy in July referred to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, attorney as merely “Department” throughout the hearing.
New York immigration Judge Shirley Lazare-Raphael told The Intercept that some ICE attorneys believe it is “dangerous to state their names publicly.” This follows a broader pattern of ICE agents wearing masks during arrests to hide their identities.
This secrecy violates a fundamental principle that has protected Americans for centuries: open courts. Here’s how those courts operate and why the principle governing them matters.
 ‘Presumption of openness’

The U.S. legal system is built on openness, with multiple layers of legal protection that guarantee public access to court proceedings.
This tradition of open courts developed as a direct rejection of secret judicial proceedings that had been used to abuse power in England. The notorious Star Chamber operated in secret from the 15th to 17th centuries, initially trying people “too powerful to be brought before ordinary common-law courts.”
But the Star Chamber eventually became a tool of oppression, using torture to obtain confessions and punishing jurors who ruled against the Crown. Parliament abolished it in 1641 after widespread abuses.
By the time American colonial courts were established, the reaction against the Star Chamber had already shaped English legal thinking toward openness. American courts adopted this principle of transparency from the beginning, rejecting the secretive proceedings that had enabled abuse.
Today, the term “star chamber” refers to any secret court proceeding that seems grossly unfair or is used to persecute individuals.
In the U.S., courts have repeatedly emphasized that “justice faces its gravest threat when courts dispense it secretly.” The First Amendment gives the public a right to observe judicial proceedings. The Supreme Court has ruled that “a presumption of openness inheres in the very nature of a criminal trial under our system of justice.”
Every federal appeals court has recognized that this constitutional right extends to civil cases too, with some exceptions such as protecting “the parties’ privacy, confidential business information, or trade secrets.” Federal court rules require that trials be “conducted in open court” and that witness testimony be “taken in open court unless otherwise provided.”
Many state constitutions also guarantee open courts – such as Oregon’s mandate that “no court shall be secret.”
While there’s no explicit law requiring attorneys to be publicly named, there’s also no policy allowing their names to be kept secret. The presumption is always toward openness.
In response to these recent developments, law professor Elissa Steglich said that she’d “never heard of someone in open court not being identified,” and that failing to identify an attorney could impair accountability “if there are unethical or professional concerns.”
 Rules for anonymity

Courts sometimes allow anonymity, but only in specific circumstances.
Juries can be anonymous when there’s “substantial danger of harm or undue influence,” as legal expert Michael Crowell writes – like in high-profile organized crime cases or when defendants have tried to intimidate witnesses before. Even then, the lawyers still know the jurors’ names.
Similarly, parties to a lawsuit can sometimes use pseudonyms like “Jane Doe” when the case involves highly sensitive matters such as sexual abuse, or when there’s a real risk of physical retaliation.
But these rare exceptions require careful court review.
What’s happening with ICE attorneys is different. There’s no formal court ruling allowing it, no specific safety findings and no established legal process.
 Immigration courts have fewer protections

Immigration courts operate differently from regular federal courts. They are so-called “administrative courts” that are part of the executive branch, not the judicial branch.
These courts decide claims involving an individual’s right to stay in the U.S., either when the government seeks to remove someone from the country for violating immigration law or when an individual seeks to stay in the country through the asylum process.
Immigration judges lack the lifetime job protections that regular federal judges have. As executive branch government employees, they can be hired and fired, just like other Department of Justice employees.
People in immigration court also have fewer procedural protections than criminal defendants. They have no right to court-appointed counsel and must represent themselves unless they can afford to hire an attorney. The majority of immigrants appear without an attorney. Outcomes are better for those who can afford to hire counsel.
Immigration court records are also less accessible to the public than other federal court proceedings.
For years, the Board of Immigration Appeals, the nation’s highest immigration court, made less than 1% of its opinions publicly available. A federal court ruled that public disclosure was required; the Board of Immigration Appeals now posts its decisions online.
However, lower immigration court decisions are rarely made public.
Because immigration courts operate with less oversight than regular federal courts, public observation becomes more critical.
Open courts aren’t just about legal procedure – they’re about democracy itself. When the public can observe how justice is administered, it builds confidence that the system is fair.
 Court watching protects transparency

Court watching has become an important way for citizens to ensure due process is honored, especially in immigration cases.
Observers can monitor whether proper legal procedures are being followed. They can watch for signs that attorneys are prepared, treating people respectfully and following court rules – regardless of whether those attorneys identify themselves.
Observers help track trends such as lack of legal representation, language barriers or procedural unfairness that can inform advocacy for reforms. This kind of public oversight is especially important in immigration court, where people often don’t have lawyers and may not understand their rights.
When community members bear witness to these proceedings, it helps ensure the system operates fairly and transparently.
 Professional ethics and accountability

As a law professor who runs a law school’s Center for Professional Ethics, I can say that while there’s no specific law forcing ICE attorneys to identify themselves, they are still bound by rules of professional conduct that require accountability and transparency.
State bar associations have clear standards about attorney conduct in court proceedings. The American Bar Association’s Model Rules of Professional Conduct emphasize that lawyers are “officers of the legal system” with duties to uphold its integrity.
Immigration judges, despite being government employees rather than lifetime-tenured federal judges, are also bound by judicial conduct codes that require them to uphold public confidence in the justice system. When judges allow or encourage anonymity without formal procedures or safety findings, they risk violating these ethical obligations.
Bar associations can investigate professional conduct violations and impose sanctions ranging from reprimands to suspension or disbarment. While enforcement against federal government lawyers has historically been uncommon, sustained documentation by court observers can provide the evidence needed for formal complaints.
While government attorneys, judges and other court personnel may face real safety concerns, hiding their identities in open court is unprecedented and breaks with centuries of legal tradition that requires accountability and transparency in our justice system.
As pressure mounts to process immigration cases quickly, courts are ethically and legally bound to ensure that speed doesn’t come at the expense of fundamental fairness and transparency.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.
Trump’s deportations could cost 6M jobs, report finds

The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.










The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling.


– Oregon Republican state Rep. Cyrus Javadi


Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.
If Trump wants more deportations, he’ll need to target the construction industry

Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.
More cities, counties join immigrant sanctuary lawsuit seeking to block Trump funding cuts

Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

As the federal government and states move to cut about $1 trillion over the next decade from Medicaid, researchers estimate annual impacts by 2034 of hundreds of thousands of jobs lost and billions less in state and local tax revenue.
The research published this month in the peer-reviewed journal JAMA Health Forum looked at the long-term economic effects of the Medicaid provisions in President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending bill, which cuts the joint state-federal health insurance program for people with lower incomes or with disabilities and provides tax cuts that disproportionately benefit wealthier Americans.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
By 2034, the researchers estimated annual economic impacts to reach 302 000 jobs lost and $135.3 billion in reduced economic output, leading to $11.1 billion in annual state and local tax revenue reductions.
Coverage losses could generate $7.6 billion in medical debt, triggering a further $3.8 billion reduction in economic activity, the study said.
As the single largest source of health coverage in the nation that covers 72 million people — or a fifth of the U.S. population — Medicaid is a key source of revenue to health care providers, as well as a significant funding stream for health facilities. Hospitals are major employers and drivers of local economies.
In New York, for example, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul’s office estimates that 65,000 jobs could be lost due to cuts in hospitals and community health centers, as well as a loss of $14.4 billion in hospital-related economic activity.

Amid recent political rhetoric about rising crime and violence in American cities, a new analysis shows that violent crime has continued to decline this year.
Homicides and several other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, dropped during the first half of 2025 across 42 U.S. cities, continuing a downward trend that began in 2022, according to a new crime trends report released Thursday by the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
Homicides fell 17% in the first half of 2025, compared with the same period in 2024, among the 30 cities that reported homicide data, according to the report.
During that same period, five cities saw increases in homicide — ranging from 6% in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to 39% in Little Rock, Arkansas.
While the report’s authors say the continued drop in violent crime — especially homicides — is encouraging, they note that much of the decline stems from a few major cities with historically high rates, such as Baltimore and St. Louis.
More than half of the cities studied have higher homicide rates than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, though, the analysis found that there were 14% fewer homicides during the first half of 2025 compared to the same period in 2019.
The authors say more research is needed before crediting any specific policy or practice for the continued drop in violent crime.
The group’s findings come as President Donald Trump continues to amplify concerns about crime, at times citing misleading statistics and narratives.
Most violent crime rates have fallen back to pre-pandemic levels, new report shows

In a Truth Social post earlier this week, Trump claimed that cashless bail — a practice that allows people charged with a crime to be released pretrial without paying money, unless a judge deems them a threat to public safety — were fueling a national crime surge and endangering law enforcement.
He wrote: “Crime in American Cities started to significantly rise when they went to CASHLESS BAIL. The WORST criminals are flooding our streets and endangering even our great law enforcement officers. It is a complete disaster, and must be ended, IMMEDIATELY!”
Some research suggests that setting money bail isn’t effective in ensuring court appearances or improving public safety. Opponents of ending cash bail often raise concerns that released suspects might commit new, potentially more serious crimes. While that is possible in individual cases, studies show that eliminating cash bail does not lead to a widespread increase in crime.
The Truth Social post also marked a sharp shift from Trump’s remarks during a June roundtable with the Fraternal Order of Police, where he claimed the national murder rate had “plummeted by 28%” since he took office — a figure that overstates the decline and overlooks the fact that murder rates began falling well before he returned to office.
According to data consulting firm AH Datalytics, which manages the Real-Time Crime Index — a free tool that collects crime data from more than 400 law enforcement agencies nationwide — the number of homicides between January and May 2025 was 20.3% lower than the same period in 2024.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Similarly, data released in May by the Major Cities Chiefs Association showed that homicides fell roughly 20% in the first quarter of 2025 compared with the first three months of the prior year. The group’s data is based on a survey of 68 major metropolitan police departments nationwide.
Researchers at the Council on Criminal Justice note in their report that it’s difficult to pinpoint a single reason for the drop in homicides, but they note that fewer people appear to be exposed to high-risk situations, such as robberies.
Most major crimes fell in the first half of 2025 compared with the same period last year, according to the council’s report.
Motor vehicle thefts dropped by 25%, while reported gun assaults fell 21%. Robberies, residential and non-residential burglaries, shoplifting, and aggravated and sexual assaults also saw double-digit declines
Drug offenses held steady, while domestic violence reports rose slightly — by about 3%. Carjackings declined 24% and larcenies were down 5%.
Compared with the first half of 2019, before the pandemic and nationwide reckoning over racial justice and policing, overall homicides are down 14%, robberies by 30%, and sexual assaults by 28%.
Still, more than 60% of the cities in the council’s study sample report homicide rates that remain above 2019 levels.
Motor vehicle theft remains the only crime tracked in the report that is still elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels — up 25% since 2019 — although it has declined sharply since 2023.
The council also released another analysis on the lethality of violent crime, showing that while violent incidents have decreased, the share of violence that ends in death has increased significantly. In 1994, there were 2 homicides per 1,000 assaults and about 16 per 1,000 robberies. By 2020, those figures rose to 7.2 and 55.8, respectively.

Andy Beshear speaks to reporters before the Forward Together Dinner in Owensboro. (Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)Gov. Andy Beshear said one reason he went to South Carolina last week was to see his 16-year-old son Will play baseball. But he spent the first two days there entering the big leagues of politics, in the state where Democrats are scheduled to cast their first votes for president in 2028.
His trip gave the clearest idea yet of what a Beshear campaign for the White House would look like, and his first close read by observers in a critical state.
Beshear’s excursion was set up nicely by his greatest sustained national news-media exposure: a 43-minute podcast with The New Yorker magazine, published online July 9; a July 13 interview on “Meet the Press,” and favorable treatment from conservative columnist George Will, who prefers governors as presidents and likened him to Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, Southern governors who moved up.
“His electoral and governing achievements are impressive,” Will declared, citing three straight wins in a state that has become solidly Republican.
Kentuckians know Beshear’s success has come not only from his handling of the pandemic, disasters and economic development, but a unique mix of dynastic Democratic-heritage politics and associated name recognition, which narrowly elected him attorney general in 2015; deep dislike of the Republican governor he unseated in 2019; and running on abortion rights after the Supreme Court changed the politics of that issue.
None of that will matter if Beshear runs for president, but his ambition should be helped by two characteristics that have been greatly responsible for his political success. The first is his ability to stay disciplined and focused, as noted in a Vogue magazine profile. That’s key in presidential campaigns, where tangents and pitfalls await at every stop. The second is his continued self-improvement. Looking at video from South Carolina, he still seems just a bit green, and he still hasn’t learned to say “who” instead of “that.” (See below.) But news coverage and commentary showed that he continues to get better, and that he drew good crowds and won some friends in a key state.
“Andy Beshear is the sort of Democrat South Carolina likes,” read the initial headline over the column of longtime Charleston Post & Courier metro columnist Brian Hicks.
Beshear’s approach contrasted with that of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who was in South Carolina for two days the week before. Newsom appeals to base Democrats by baiting President Trump; Beshear is aiming for moderates, independents and anti-Trump Republicans with a focus on kitchen-table issues.
“We can’t be runnin’ after every outrage of the day,” he said on Pawleys Island. “The most important thing we can do is be laser-focused on people’s jobs, their next doctor’s appointment, the roads and bridges they drive, the school they drop their kids off at, and whether they feel safe in their community.” He told The New Yorker that he’s for term limits, a populist totem, and that the party and its candidates “need to spend 80 percent of our time on these issues” because “People don’t wake up thinking about politics.”
On the other 20 percent, Beshear blasts Trump’s tariffs, “cruelty and incompetence” and his big bill’s impact on rural areas. He deals deftly with LGBTQ+ rights, the most troublesome culture-war topic for Democrats. He told The New Yorker that when he vetoed “the nastiest piece of anti-LGBTQ legislation our state had ever seen . . . I said ‘My faith tells me that children are children of God, and I’m gonna stand up for these kids.’ . . . People respect conviction and they want people that stand up for what they believe in.”
A deacon in the Disciples of Christ (Christian Church), Beshear typically refers to his faith in speeches. That’s trickier than it was for Carter, because the country is more secular now. It seemed to play well in South Carolina, which is friendlier territory for a Southerner than, say, New Hampshire. But independents can vote in the New England state’s primary, which could be Democrats’ first in 2028. Beshear’s been there, too.
He will be in many places through 2026, as that year’s chairman of the Democratic Governors Association. It’s his best chance to build political capital, especially with campaign contributors. He surely knows it’s a heavy lift. “What we really need is someone who can heal this country, to get us back together, to not have this constant us-versus-them,” he told The New Yorker. “And what I’ll consider is, am I a candidate that can do that? Or is someone else a candidate that can do that? And if it’s someone else they’ll have my full backing, because I love this country more than anything, and we’ve just got to get back to a better place for every future generation.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4217-e1749869499713-1024x918.jpg,,,2025-07-25 00:56:26.327422

Santiago/Getty Images)Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.
The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.

The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.
Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.

Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.

Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-25 04:01:56+00:00,CT Mirror,Veiled intentions and the progressive rhetoric that keeps CT segregated,Jackie McDougall,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/25/veiled-intentions-and-the-progressive-rhetoric-that-keeps-ct-segregated-jackie/,"Building affordable housing is not just an act of kindness, but one of necessity in a state with some of the most separate but unequal housing anywhere in the country.","A few weeks ago, many of us who call Connecticut home witnessed just how power works. I am referring here to the way in which the country’s institutions profess opportunity for all, then deny it for some, and not others. 
To be precise, in Gov. Ned Lamont’s veto of the moderate H.B. 5002, we heard the now prototypical commitment to our nations’ ideals, followed by its predictable abandonment. 
In our fear of the “other,” it seems, we continuously deny the right to a basic life well lived to all. Surely, the issue of housing is not just one of a house and its moorings, it is also one of the basic standard of living we would expect for any of our neighbors.
This recent vote for the bill was overwhelmingly about decency; and it is indecent, that some of us in Connecticut are able to go back to a house that is a home, at the same time that others live an existence of worry, fear, despair, of mere existence.   
How can we really proclaim that the American Dream is one for all when it is really only for some? As a devoted citizen of Connecticut, I believe it is all of our responsibility to ensure everyone has access to a true home. Yes, we already build affordable housing in locations where it is considered “acceptable,” but if a house in which a basic life well-lived is denied, it is not really a home.
You see, in Connecticut, as in so much of the country, many of us were never destined to own a home. From the country’s very inception, coded rhetoric and legislation served to separate those who “mattered,” and those who were “underserving.” With the passing of the Fair Housing Administration that restricted household living to certain groups; and redlining that created residential segregation benefitting only some Americans; those in power set a clear precedent regarding the kind of living conditions we call acceptable today.
This selective denial of liberty that started with these earlier tactics has regrettably been perpetuated still, through exclusionary zoning practices, such the pervasive enforcement of single-family-only areas in most suburbs and towns. This impervious imbalance within housing segregation has also been perpetuated by the softening of modern laws such as the 8-30g statute.
Amendments to this law – which simply set basic standards for municipalities with low levels of affordable housing – have made it increasingly ineffective in guaranteeing any housing reform at all. Finally, through the relentless insistence on local control, as well as the incredibly complex bureaucracy that faces almost all proposals for affordable housing, the exclusion of the unhoused and cost-burdened renter is nearly complete. 
You may understand the act of building affordable housing is not just an act of kindness, but one of absolute necessity in a state with some of the most separate but unequal housing anywhere in the country. To reprise, housing is not only a stabilizing anchor, but also an opportunity to truly live. With it, not only do our children have the opportunity to thrive, but residents have access to healthier lifestyles, more accessible transportation, and also greater means to achieve the life they truly desire.
We are doing no favors here by asking everyone to open their hearts and minds to another individual they don’t yet know. Just the opposite: it is our duty as both citizens of Connecticut and the nation as we know it to allow everyone an equal chance to thrive. For decades or longer, millions have been denied this opportunity. In our decision to tell these citizens where they can and cannot live, many of us return to rationalizations of the “other” as lazy, incompetent, fundamentally deficient. What’s more, we speak of these matters, not through language that makes plain and clear these misunderstandings; but in code, through which rational, surface level discourse effectively stifles discussion altogether.
All I simply ask: let’s get to know a future neighbor before we deny them a chance at a life well lived. Let’s come to know them, alongside ourselves, as people willing to negotiate our shared space, before denying them something we wouldn’t dare deny ourselves. 
Now is the time to open the doors of life, liberty and a life well lived to everyone.

U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Habba, who currently serves as Counselor to the President, to replace current attorney John Giordano who was nominated serve as Ambassador to Namibia.   (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)New Jersey’s embattled acting U.S. attorney will stay in the post after some Trump administration maneuvering, capping a tumultuous few days that saw the state’s federal judges rejecting her bid to stay on the job.
Alina Habba, a personal attorney for President Donald Trump who was appointed the state’s chief federal prosecutor in March for a temporary term that expires this week, resigned as U.S. attorney Thursday, was named first assistant U.S. attorney, and because the U.S. attorney post was then vacant, she resumed the office’s top job in an acting role immediately.
“I don’t cower to pressure. I don’t answer to politics,” Habba wrote on social media. “This is a fight for justice. And I’m all in.”
Thursday’s moves ensure Habba will remain the U.S. attorney for the next 210 days, according to the White House.
New Jersey’s two U.S. senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, both Democrats, said the Trump administration’s push to keep Habba as U.S. attorney undermines the legitimacy of the judiciary and ignores the required advice and consent of Congress.
“The Trump Administration’s relentless attacks on the court are not only disgraceful, they’re knowingly hypocritical,” the two men said in a joint statement.
As Habba’s initial, 120-day term as acting U.S. attorney was coming to a close, the state’s district judges were tasked with choosing whether to keep her on permanently or choose a replacement. Federal law says if the president’s choice for U.S. attorney has no Senate confirmation after 120 days, the judges have the power to fill the vacancy.
Habba campaigned to remain on the job. But on Tuesday, Judge Renée Marie Bumb, chief jurist in the U.S. District Court, announced the judges had chosen Habba’s second-in-command, Desiree Grace. The Trump administration within hours said Grace had been “removed,” though Grace on Wednesday said in a statement she intended to begin her term as U.S. attorney this week.
On Thursday, the White House said it withdrew Habba’s nomination for Senate confirmation as U.S. attorney.
Habba’s term has been controversial, largely because of her stated push to use the office to help Republicans get elected in New Jersey. In May, her office arrested Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat, and charged him with trespassing on the site of a private migrant jail in Newark. Her office dropped that charge days later and then charged a Baraka ally, Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-10), with assaulting officers during Baraka’s arrest.

He and four other Assembly members testified in support of the bill during an Assembly committee meeting on Thursday, July 24, 2025, at the Statehouse in Trenton. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)An Assembly panel advanced a controversial bill that would create a state definition of antisemitism Thursday after more than seven hours of impassioned testimony from hundreds of supporters and critics alike.
Supporters cited rising rates of antisemitic hate crimes as a reason why lawmakers must pass the bill, which has more than 50 cosponsors and includes a $100,000 state funding allocation for a public education campaign.
Opponents said the bill, which would adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism, would violate free speech rights by criminalizing criticism of Israel. Several cited crackdowns on campus protests and pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, who the Trump administration detained and aims to deport after declaring his anti-Israel activism antisemitic.
The disagreement ran so deep that tensions exploded even hours before the Assembly state and local government committee’s hearing on the measure started. Pro-Palestinian advocates held a morning rally outside the Statehouse to condemn the bill, and several pro-Israel activists tried to disrupt it, prompting state troopers to scramble to defuse the resulting shoving match between both sides.
Things didn’t go much more smoothly inside.
Troopers had to open four overflow rooms to accommodate the crowds who showed up to testify, and testimony grew so heated that Assemblyman Robert Karabinchak (D-Middlesex), the committee’s chair, repeatedly pounded his gavel to restore order and threatened to have troopers remove disruptive spectators.
Assemblyman Gary Schaer (D-Passaic), the bill’s chief sponsor, kicked off the testimony just after noon. Four other Assembly members from both parties beside him also testified in support of the bill.
Schaer denied that the bill would infringe upon the First Amendment, saying its goal is simple — to combat rising antisemitism.
“A statutory definition of antisemitism gives law enforcement a clear lens to determine the motivation and/or intent behind a criminal act or bias incident that may have been motivated by antisemitism,” he said. “It may also be incorporated into policy development and anti-bias training. However, the legislation does not create new criminal penalties or criminalize protected speech. Instead, it ensures that when an individual paints a swastika on a synagogue, shouts slurs at a Jewish student, or otherwise targets someone based on their Jewish identity, we have a consistent, recognized standard by which to evaluate.”
Dozens of Jewish groups, mayors, and others echoed that support.
“The Jewish community must stand up to the bullies who see this bill as a threat to their ability to harass and intimidate us,” said Jason Shames, president and CEO of the Jewish Federation of Northern New Jersey.
But DaWuan Norwood, policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, said the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition conflates protected political speech with unprotected discrimination.
“Incorporating this definition into law has been widely criticized and condemned because it is overbroad and not rooted in legal protections that exist to ensure safety from hostile environments, bias, or harassment. Instead, the definition threatens to prohibit speech based on viewpoint alone,” Norwood said.
Omayma Mansour, a pro-Palestinian activist who lives in Princeton, tested that theory by talking about Gaza and genocide during her testimony. Karabinchak interrupted her, redirecting her to the bill.
“Can I say what I just said? Because it doesn’t look like I can, which means that my free speech, my First Amendment rights, are not protected based on this bill,” Mansour said.
She called the bill unconstitutional and “a hot mess of a bill” and predicted it would not withstand judicial scrutiny.
“Should this pass, we will challenge it in court, and every court in this nation will clearly show you how unconstitutional this is,” Mansour said.

Sadaf Jaffer, a former assemblywoman, testified against the bill, saying it wrongly requires New Jerseyans to accept Israel as a Jewish state. The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance lists, as an example of antisemitism, “denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.”
“How is that different from requiring all New Jerseyans to accept Iran as an Islamic Republic or the U.S. as a Christian nation? These kinds of ideological tests are absurd and dangerous,” Jaffer said.
Many critics warned the bill would be used to silence criticism of Israel, but those concerns prompted lawmakers to amend the bill to state: “Nothing in this section shall be construed to diminish or infringe upon any right to criticize the government of the State of Israel in a manner similar to that leveled against any other country.”
Jaffer also questioned the need for a state definition of antisemitism.
“We have no special definitions for anti-Black, anti-Arabic, or anti-Palestinian hate,” Jaffer said. “Meanwhile, the bill’s prime sponsor, Assemblyman Schaer, had to fire his own chief of staff for making anti-Black, anti-Muslim, and anti-Arabic statements.”
People on both sides of the issue shared personal stories of persecution.
Livingston Mayor Edward Meinhardt, a Democrat, told lawmakers he was the son of two Holocaust refugees and urged them to pass the legislation.
“We have a duty, a moral obligation, to teach the history of the past so that it’ll never be repeated,” Meinhardt said. “We must educate those who do not understand what antisemitism is. We must support those who have experienced it and teach them how to combat it. And we must start this education from a very young age to prevent hate from taking root.”
Legislators considered the bill during a rare return from their traditional summer recess, which is expected to last until after November’s general election. The panel — whose members were all sponsors of the bill — passed it unanimously, just after 8 p.m.
In explaining his vote, Assemblyman Avi Schnall (D-Monmouth) told the sparse audience remaining in the chamber that he’s a “visible Jew” and recently got ambushed during a visit to Washington, D.C., by people calling him a murderer and accusing him of killing children in Gaza.
“As far as I know, I live in New Jersey. I’ve never been to Gaza,” Schnall said. “What do I have to do with the children and the atrocities that are going on there? They are atrocities. It’s terrible. But that’s when I realized that, yes, unfortunately, the lines have become blurred, and that is the reality. The reality today is that, unfortunately, people are claiming if you’re Jewish, you must be a Zionist, and if you’re a Zionist, you’re responsible for genocide.”
The Senate version of the bill passed in that chamber’s state government committee in June 2024 by a 4-1 vote — after a nine-hour hearing. It awaits consideration by the full Senate.

February 2024 | Kyle DavidsonState Rep. Alabas Farhat (D-Dearborn) was removed as the minority vice chair of the House Appropriations Committee on Thursday evening after a political standoff on the chamber floor ended with two Republican priorities dying without enough votes to pass.
The episode was just another bad blood performance between the Republican and Democratic House caucuses this term as budget talks have ground to a halt and gamemanship runs rampant.
Farhat met with members of the Capitol press corps after session, and started by saying: “This town is a f****** mess.”
“Unequivocally. That’s what it is,” Farhat said. “If you look at my legislative history as who I am … every single bill was bipartisan last year. [I am a person] who worked 19 substitutes to get Republicans the support of a Public Safety Trust Fund, who went out of his way to make sure we incorporated voices that mattered at the table, because I believe when you govern, you want to govern through consensus.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In a regularly scheduled press conference with members of the Michigan Capitol press corps, House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) said Farhat’s removal was predicated on a number of issues. Some of that had to do with their negotiations on the budget – which have all but ground to a halt – and commitments he supposedly made with House Republican leadership to get votes on bills that were up for final passage.
Those items were House Bill 4141, legislation to ban the use of cell phones in schools during instructional hours, and House Bill 4506, which would amend state law so prosecutors could continue to seek life-without-parole sentences for 19- and 20-year-old criminal defendants convicted of some crimes.  The latter bill is part of a larger three-bill package.
Both bills were defeated on the House floor on Thursday, with the cell phone bill dying with a vote of 53-43, and with the criminal sentencing bill also dying on a 55-43 vote. The criminal sentencing bill was put up for reconsideration after it only mustered a vote of 55-42, but the second vote produced no better outcome for the legislation.
Of note, a key Republican, state Rep. James DeSana of Carleton, was not present on the floor Thursday evening in a quasi protest because House leadership wasn’t taking up his own legislative priorities, DeSana told The Detroit News. He could have delivered a vote to at least save one of the bills.
But during the second vote on the criminal sentencing bill, the board remained open for nearly an hour, which Hall said was done to give Democrats an opportunity to vote on the bills without letting them off the hook of taking a no vote on the issues.
Once Farhat voted no on the criminal sentencing bill, the voting board was closed and it was determined that the bill had failed for a second time.
Almost immediately afterward, the House read a letter sent in by Hall, which instructed the Republican House leadership to remove Farhat as minority vice chair on appropriations.
Hall later said that he and leadership had worked out a deal that if they could get votes on the bill, and even with some amendments made to curry favor with their Democratic colleagues, they would put some of their members’ bills up and move them along.
Hall said he was certain that he had secured a deal with Farhat to do just that, but then he changed his mind. That led Hall to question Farhat’s commitment on other deals that could be worked out in the future.
“I’ll just say that, in this business, the only thing you have is your word,” Hall said. “I’ve done a lot of deals with Democrats over the last several years, and I always follow through on the things that I said I was going to do. And we expect that from everyone, Republican and Democrat.”

Hall added that if the Republicans don’t have someone they can count on across the aisle, then a change has to be made in the leadership structure, which is what happened with Farhat on Thursday.
“We need somebody that we really think is really going to represent the Democrats well, and somebody who could honor their commitments,” Hall said. “That’s what we wanted, a partner to work together to get a bipartisan budget deal done. I think we’re making so much progress with Governor Whitmer coming together on the budget, on roads, on education. We attempted to help some of her priorities today, like the cell phone ban.”
To Hall’s point, the ban was floated by Whitmer in this year’s State of the State address to the Legislature.
House Minority Leader Rajeev Puri (D-Canton), said the night was a disaster and he wasn’t sure why they were brought in tonight. He also said that Democrats all term have been willing to work, but the way the institution works, the buck stops with the leader of the chamber.
“This is just a failed approach,” Puri said of Hall’s leadership and the institution of the House writ large. “It’s not set up to be sustainable. I think it’s driving the institution into the ground. I think the Speaker has signed up for a role that he’s a little overwhelmed in right now, and not understanding how to move pieces in order to run the institution in a way it needs to go.”
Puri said none of the situations present before the House were novel, not the budget or otherwise.
“Getting a budget done on time has happened before,” Puri said. “The only piece that’s different here is we’ve been living through this political theater with some really bad actors. I don’t know when the Speaker is going to realize that he has to actually work with the House Democrats if he wants this to work.”
Farhat added that what lawmakers are seeing is an ideology that rewards lack of cooperation, and the chaos of the evening, he said, was an attempt by Hall to get an attention grabbing headline out of an otherwise lackluster day.
“This is all being pushed, unfortunately, to straddle real negotiations,” Farhat said. “This is impacting our ability to do a budget. I have worked in good faith through this entire process, and I think to use a non-budgetary item – let’s be clear – this wasn’t the budget – this wasn’t a budget negotiator. … This was more of an exercise of the dysfunction of this town than it was an exercise of the willingness on our side to work.”
When asked if the speaker’s narrative was accurate, Farhat said there were conversations on the bill, but he doesn’t ever remember coming to an agreement with Hall or leadership to vote a certain way.
On whether the budget negotiations were the issue at hand, Farhat said he hopes Hall “was not surprised that I would never accept us to defund school lunch or teacher retirements.”
“I got moved because I was someone who wanted to fight for values,” Farhat said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IMG_1977-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-24 23:32:09.286739

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)   It took a little over an hour on Thursday for U.S. District Judge Melissa DuBose to side with a coalition of housing and domestic violence prevention groups challenging federal grant restrictions under President Donald Trump’s administration.
The lawsuit was filed earlier this week after both the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Housing and Urban Development (HUD) tweaked their grantmaking policies in recent months to potentially deny funding for programs that support DEI initiatives or serve LGBTQ+ individuals. Grant applicants would also need to certify that their funds would not be used to support projects that conflict with the administrative viewpoint.
But what DuBose called the “offending language” barring any funds for DEI-related efforts was stripped from the Health and Human Services’ grant policy around 1:30 p.m., right before the hearing started, according to Department of Justice Attorney Kevin Love Hubbard, who represented the federal government. HUD, he said, had not changed the language in its policy.
Kristin Bateman, one of the plaintiffs’ attorneys and a senior counsel with Democracy Forward, argued that the court still needed to provide immediate relief as a grant deadline approaches on July 30. 
DuBose granted a temporary restraining order for the coalition of 22 organizations, including six based in Rhode Island, against the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services and Housing and Urban Development. The motion for an injunction will work its way through a lengthier court process. Both the temporary order and the injunction were filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Rhode Island in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island in Providence on Monday. The Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, Democracy Forward, Jacobson Lawyers Group, and the National Women’s Law Center also represent the plaintiffs. 
“The immediate harm is that [grantees] have to make this choice by Wednesday,” Bateman said. “For many of them, they have to either decide to accept these unlawful conditions…that are going to force them to change their programs that are going to be inconsistent with their values and their mission, or they have to turn down the the program funding, which would mean they don’t have the money anymore to support shelter and housing for victims of domestic violence.”
Bateman argued that the agencies’ new grant conditions “have nothing to do with the purposes of the grant programs that Congress established” and instead uplift “wholly unrelated ideological and policy goals of the administration.” 
DuBose asked Bateman for clarity: “It’s just the virtue of even having to make this choice is what you’re arguing is the harm?”
Bateman agreed with DuBose’s summary of her argument, and DuBose agreed with the plaintiffs. But DuBose asked the plaintiffs’ legal team to “narrowly tailor” the requested relief so that it would affect only those whose funds were most immediately threatened. DuBose requested the revised order be submitted by Monday.
“We’re living in a time where there are rapidly changing circumstances,” DuBose said before she offered her ruling from the bench. “Even as we’re sitting here, things are changing.”
DuBose asked Bateman to consider the last-minute changes made by HHS before court, and whether they “changed the calculus” of what the plaintiffs were requesting, but the attorney said she didn’t think so.
“We all know what’s going on here,” Bateman offered. “It’s the same thing. We have an administration that wants to eradicate DEI, DEIA, from the government.”
The government’s viewpoint 
Hubbard, who was filling in for a DOJ colleague, previously worked in private law on behalf of marginalized clients, including people of color and transgender people. He was appointed to the role of Civil Division Chief in the DOJ’s Rhode Island Office in January 2024, the same month that DuBose was nominated to her seat on the District Court. 
In his arguments, Hubbard referenced DuBose’s July 1 ruling in favor of a multistate coalition against HHS.
“I don’t want to present you with any arguments you’ve already rejected, but I do think this case is a lot different than that one,” he said.
Hubbard pointed to plaintiffs who had not found the choice as impossible to make as their attorneys had described, like a Virginia-based grantee that accepted the DEI provisions, and the Rhode Island Coalition to End Homelessness, which submitted its applications with the contested language struck out.
“The choice that they’re saying is impossible to make, some people have already made,” Hubbard said.
Hubbard also disputed Bateman’s argument that asking grantees to confirm their adherence with an administration’s ideology was a violation of the First Amendment.
“It essentially forces the grantees to adopt the administration’s view of gender,” Bateman said, referencing one of Trump’s executive orders on gender. “It basically takes the position that gender identity is not a thing. ‘We only do biological sex.’’”
Hubbard’s counterpoint: “As the plaintiff suggested, that the government’s viewpoint is quite different now than it was six months ago, but that in itself does not create a First Amendment violation.”
Later in the hearing, DuBose asked Hubbard how agencies should administer programs in light of new mandates which she paraphrased as, “You have to be anti-DEI or anti-woke.”
“So what happens in those instances?” DuBose continued. “There are some programs here that do not follow that straight line, where there actually is a tie in the congressional enabling statute that speaks to targeting and reaching out to minority groups or historically marginalized groups. Do you draw a line there in your analysis?”
“Respectfully, your honor, I’m not going to try and draw that line,” Hubbard said.

(U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee video screenshot)The Alaska Bar Association’s board of governors is considering whether to recommend the disbarment of former federal judge Joshua Kindred and will vote on the issue next month.
Kindred, appointed by President Donald Trump to the U.S. District Court of Alaska, resigned in 2024 after investigators found that he had a “sexualized relationship” with a clerk who became a prosecutor and lied about it to a senior judge and investigators, and maintained a hostile workplace for law clerks.
Kindred’s Alaska law license is listed as “inactive” in the ABA database; disbarring him would mean that he is unable to practice law in the state. 
A final decision on disbarment would come from the Alaska Supreme Court, which makes the final decisions on attorney discipline in the state, said Annette Blair, legal secretary of the discipline section for the bar association.
No current or former federal judge has ever been disbarred in Alaska. 
According to documents made available ahead of the bar association’s August meeting, someone filed a complaint against Kindred in January, requesting a discipline hearing.
Kindred did not attend that hearing, which took place in June.
“Based on the uncontested facts, the (area hearing) committee agrees with, and adopts, the legal analysis set out in the petition as well as in the memorandum that disbarment is the appropriate sanction for Mr. Kindred’s misconduct,” the hearing report states.
In a footnote, the committee recommended that Kindred be given a path to restoring his law license after at least five years of disbarment.
“We enter our decision not with any joy. It is our collective hope Mr. Kindred can recover emotionally, financially and physically notwithstanding the hardships Mr. Kindred confronts,” a footnote states.
The bar association’s board of governors is scheduled to meet Aug. 21 by Zoom, with the vote on action against Kindred expected in the afternoon. 
If the board approves disbarment, that recommendation will be sent to the Alaska Supreme Court for final action, to be taken at an as-yet-unscheduled date.

(Photo by Max Graham/Northern Journal)A small Canadian company behind a controversial effort to mine uranium in Western Alaska has pulled out of the project, the firm has announced.
Panther Minerals last year proposed exploratory drilling over the next four years in search of uranium on Alaska’s Seward Peninsula.
But it ultimately decided to abandon the project, called Boulder Creek, based on “seasonal, logistical, and capital considerations,” the company said in a four-paragraph press release dated July 11. 
Panther’s proposal had sparked sharp opposition among residents of the Indigenous village of Elim, a community of some 350 Iñupiaq and Yup’ik people that’s perched on the southern coast of the Seward Peninsula. The village is about 30 miles south of the uranium prospect and 90 miles east of Nome.
Elim residents fear that uranium mining could pollute the nearby Tubutulik River, which they depend on for salmon and other fish. The village has a single, tiny grocery store, and many residents subsist largely on wild foods. 
Panther had eyed the region as a possible source of uranium to help power a global transition to cleaner energy. Uranium is essential to nuclear power, and, like many other minerals used in low-carbon energy, the United States currently produces very little of it.
The site targeted by Panther — Alaska’s largest known uranium prospect — is far from being a producing mine, and one likely would require years of study before being built.
While the company’s departure all but ensures that no exploratory drilling will be done at Boulder Creek this summer, and casts some uncertainty over the deposit’s potential, it’s still possible that another firm could pick up the project. 
The mining claims that Panther had leased are still owned by Dave Hedderly-Smith, a Washington state-based geologist and prospector who has spent decades in Alaska’s mining industry. In an interview last week, he said he still would like to see the prospect developed and is already fielding interest from other companies. 
Hedderly-Smith added that he sees Panther’s exit as an opportunity to work with a different company with greater mining expertise and a stronger focus on community outreach.
Mining opponents in Elim celebrated the news, but said they remain wary of new developers entering the picture.
“I really want to say, ‘It’s really good. It’s a win for us,’” said Emily Murray, an Elim resident and vice president of the Norton Bay Watershed Council, a group opposed to uranium mining in the area.  
But if another mineral exploration company moves in, “we’re still going to fight,” she added.
Panther’s state permit for mineral exploration could be amended to include a new operator, according to Lorraine Henry, a spokesperson with the state’s land management agency, the Department of Natural Resources. 
A completely new permit may not be required if the proposed work remains the same, she added.

Strategic wood addition efforts have increased the number of brook trout in the northeast corner of the state by 83,000 over the past 13 years, according to the Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department’s conservative estimates.

ORANGE — On a mid-June afternoon, the Waits River in Groton State Forest gurgled under a bridge just off Route 302 and into a picturesque scene. The water used multiple channels to make its way across the riverbed — faster or slower, deeper or shallower — rippling as it rushed over gravel and stone and lapping lazily at the sandy shore that led into a floodplain forest.
Every 100 feet or so, the river traversed a pile of logs and brush. While the jumble mimicked what could exist naturally, nature was not the architect behind this particular tangle of woody material. Instead, contractors working for the Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department had carefully cut and installed each tree in order to eventually create this exact scene. Their goal? Creating a perfect home for Vermont’s state fish, the brook trout.
Jud Kratzer, fisheries biologist with the department and the driving force behind the wood structures, looked out at the river. He pointed to places where brook trout were likely hiding: under the cover of roots near the shore in the slow water, where fast water nearby serves as a “conveyor belt of food,” and in a deep plunge pool carved out under the structure by last summer’s deluge of floodwater.
“We put a camera down there, and there’s ‘brooks’ under there,” Kratzer said. “But, I mean, I didn’t need a camera to tell me that.”
In 2024, Kratzer oversaw the assembly of numerous wood piles on the Waits River, a technique known as strategic wood addition. The practice has been shown to improve habitat for brook trout, anglers’ most popular target and an important indicator of ecosystem health. The results also provide numerous additional benefits for wildlife and people.
Over the past 13 years, Vermont Fish & Wildlife has worked together with the nonprofit Trout Unlimited to implement strategic wood addition on 68 miles of northeastern Vermont headwater streams, which join together to form larger rivers, Kratzer said. According to the department’s conservative estimates, those “fairly low-cost” efforts have increased the number of brook trout in that area by 83,000.
The “calendar-picture streams” people are used to are “wide, flat and shallow” from a fish’s perspective, said Erin Rodgers, the Vermont and Massachusetts program manager for Trout Unlimited, in an email. They lack places to hide from predators, don’t have much draw for the insects fish eat and easily heat up during summer — “death for coldwater fish that can’t tolerate prolonged heat.”
“Putting large wood back into a stream changes all that,” Rodgers wrote.
The wood pile is designed to collect sticks and leaves that insects — which fish eat — can feed on, she said. The structure causes water to flow at different speeds, allowing sediment to gather in slow-moving areas while faster-moving water creates deeper channels. This “creates diverse in-stream habitat for lots of different species, creates protected spaces so adult fish can hide from predators, and the pool formations (make) deeper coldwater refuge,” Rodgers said.
Kratzer has studied, developed and led the state’s strategic wood addition efforts since 2012, and has presented about the technique across the eastern United States and Canada. Last year, he received an award from the American Fisheries Society recognizing that work as an outstanding project in sport fishery development and management.
However, back when Kratzer began exploring “strategic wood addition” (a term he came up with), the scientific literature on the process was divided and, he said, members of his department were somewhat resistant to the idea: Vermont rivers look fairly undeveloped and pristine to the untrained eye.

But the pristine-seeming rivers of the Northeast looked much different when Europeans first arrived, Kratzer explained. Those settlers saw vast forests filled with huge trees that fell into the rivers when they died — what strategic wood addition emulates. Then, during the 18th and 19th centuries, those rivers were cleared and even straightened to transport logs and boats.
“We are several generations removed from seeing our rivers like they were originally,” Kratzer said, adding that when the project began, he thought the state “could do better.”
In a 2013 study, Kratzer researched the factors limiting brook trout abundance in northeastern Vermont. While the study showed that the most important factor was water temperature (the fish like it cool), the second most important was, in fact, how much wood was in the stream (more is better).
Armed with that data, strategic wood addition began. Within three years after the structures were constructed on the East Branch of the Nulhegan River deep in the Northeast Kingdom, electrofishing data showed that brook trout biomass — both the number of fish and their size — approximately tripled.

In addition to its benefits for fish, Kratzer points out that the practice can help people too: “strategic wood addition slows water down and pushes it out into the forest, so it doesn’t just come rushing downstream to where we all live.” 
He and Rodgers are both quick to note that a lot of precaution is taken to secure the wood piles into the bank so that they stay locked down during flood events. Also, most of the work has been done in the headwaters, where there is very little human infrastructure. 
Even after major flooding in both 2023 and 2024, Kratzer’s team found that 82% of its sites (over 1,000 are tagged) are in the same place and still performing at least one function of a successful strategic wood addition structure. The others, he said, are usually just lodged slightly downstream.
Along with the water, the wood additions also retain sediment and nutrients, storing them in the headwaters for the benefit of the ecosystem, “instead of transporting them downstream where they clog culverts and degrade water quality,” Shayne Jacobs, watershed restoration manager for The Nature Conservancy in Vermont, said in an email.

The Nature Conservancy has implemented strategic wood addition on some of the land it owns in Vermont, Jacobs said. The nonprofit organization is working to train others in the practice, increase awareness among landowners and connect people to available funding sources “so that the use of strategic wood addition as a river restoration technique increases dramatically,” he said.
Kratzer has similar plans: his team is close to completing their work on the publicly owned land in the Northeast Kingdom where the practice can be beneficial, and soon expects to shift his role to facilitating the same work on private lands throughout the state. Currently, he said, only one contractor is trained in the practice.
The technique is slowly spreading to other states. Kratzer wrote a handbook on the practice in 2020, and said that strategic wood addition is now in use in other parts of New England, West Virginia and as far south as Tennessee. In Vermont, Trout Unlimited has also implemented the practice on several watersheds in central and southern parts of the state.
In the Western United States, Kratzer said, similar practices adapted for the distinct landscape are in use.
Last summer, Kratzer was invited to Prince Edward Island to present his work to all of its province’s watershed groups, which had been pulling wood out of rivers for a long time and thought it was the best thing to do, he said. Kratzer called the experience “the most rewarding thing” he’s done in his entire career, being able to completely flip their perspective on wood in streams just by presenting his research.
“I’ve come to believe that the single greatest benefit of this work isn’t just the increase in brook trout or the increase in stream function,” he said. “It’s the message that wood in streams is beneficial.”
Not in all places, though, Kratzer was clear: Wood that is endangering a bridge or culvert has reason to be removed. But in the many places where it doesn’t pose a threat, it should be left and even enhanced, he said.
On the same mid-June afternoon — 40 miles away from the picturesque scene in Groton State Forest — two members of Kratzer’s team carried a chainsaw, axe and orange hard hats along a brook at the base of Wheeler Mountain in Willoughby State Forest. About every 80 feet, they stopped to strategically cut, drag and position trees and brush across Big Valley Brook, wedging the structure into the bank for years to come, covering about a quarter mile a day.
Rodgers admits that, when strategic wood additions are first installed, “it is pretty ugly.” There are limbs and leaves everywhere, and you can barely see the stream under trees, she said. But the structure naturalizes quickly and makes the river ecologically healthier.According to Kratzer, the department likes to say that “fish grow on trees,” — the living forest provides benefits that continue when trees die and fall into the water, whether the process be natural or human-assisted.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Former Alaska Congresswoman Mary Peltola has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the people who employed her husband Eugene “Buzzy” Peltola Jr. at the time of his fatal plane crash in 2023.
The suit came shortly before the two-year statute of limitations deadline to bring a case and just days before the National Transportation Safety Board released a final report on the crash.
Peltola Jr. died on Sept. 12, 2023, when the Piper PA-18-150 Super Cub he was flying crashed shortly after takeoff from a hunting camp near the lower Yukon River in Southwest Alaska.
The NTSB concluded that the crash was due to Peltola’s decision to load the plane beyond its rated capacity and to tie moose antlers to one of the plane’s wings, a common practice in rural Alaska that nonetheless formally requires permission from the Federal Aviation Administration.
Those factors “degraded takeoff performance and flight characteristics resulting in a loss of airplane control during takeoff into an area of mechanical turbulence and downdrafts,” federal investigators wrote.
The report was released on July 22. On July 18, Mary Peltola filed a civil lawsuit in Bethel Superior Court.
That filing was first reported by KYUK-FM public radio, a station that may close due to federal budget clawbacks approved by Congress.
The suit alleges that the owners of the plane — also Peltola Jr.’s employers — caused him to “fly excessive hours, to fly without adequate sleep or rest, (and) to fly under unreasonably dangerous conditions,” conditions that contributed to his death.
It names Bruce Werba and two companies he operated — Alaska Pike Safaris and Wilderness Adventures LLC, and Neitz Aviation Inc. — as the defendants.
Peltola Jr. had held senior positions with the federal government, retiring in 2022 as the regional director of the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs for Alaska.

Survivors say the utility is trying to “buy us off.”","In summary
The Eaton Fire’s cause is still under investigation, but Southern California Edison is planning to launch a fund to compensate those affected. Survivors say the utility is trying to “buy us off.” 


Southern California Edison this week said it will create a compensation program for those affected by the deadly Eaton Fire in January. Set to launch this fall, the “Wildfire Recovery Compensation Program” will pay eligible victims for claims of injury, death and property loss in an effort to curb lawsuits. 
Investigators are still determining the fire’s cause, but Southern California Edison has said the leading is that its transmission lines started the blaze. The 14,000-acre fire broke out in Altadena in early January, killing 19 people. Southern California Edison is facing multiple lawsuits from those who lost loved ones, homes and businesses.
“Even though the details of how the Eaton Fire started are still being evaluated, SCE will offer an expedited process to pay and resolve claims fairly and promptly,” Pedro Pizarro, CEO of the utility’s parent company Edison International, said in a release. “This allows the community to focus more on recovery instead of lengthy, expensive litigation.”
The program will cover losses for physical injury, death, structure losses for both owners and renters, business interruptions, loss of commercial property and damage caused by smoke and ash, according to its website.
But no specifics — including who’s eligible, how much money the utility has set aside, whether ratepayers or shareholders will pay and whether participants will be required to forego litigation — have been decided, said spokesperson David Eisenhauer. Those details won’t be available until later this summer, he said.
When CalMatters asked why the utility released some of the news about the compensation program this week instead of waiting until it had the details hammered out, Eisenhauer said the company had been part of the Altadena community for 140 years and paraphrased Pizarro’s statement back to CalMatters. 
“Generally with wildfire claims, the first $1 billion is paid by customer-funded insurance,” Eisenhauer said. “After that, we seek reimbursement from the [California] Wildfire Fund.”
That fund is a pool of money the state’s three major investor-owned utilities pay into to cover losses from utility-sparked fires. The Los Angeles Times reported this week that the state fund is at risk of being exhausted from claims from the fire. 
This isn’t the first time utilities have offered compensation programs to the public following a major fire. Pacific Gas & Electric ran a similar program following the Dixie and Mosquito fires in 2021 and 2022. One aspect PG&E made explicit was that to participate, fire survivors would need to drop any lawsuits they had against the utility. Southern California Edison’s Eisenhauer said that requirement is still up in the air for its program.
Some fire survivors and those advocating for them are skeptical. Mike Rothschild and his family lost their Altadena home and nearly everything they owned to the fire. He and several others have filed a lawsuit against Southern California Edison seeking unspecified damages for lost property, emotional distress, medical expenses and punitive damages. 
“My first reaction was they are trying to buy us off,” he said. “It felt like they knew they had a serious problem and they were throwing some cash out to hopefully make it go away.”
Rothschild does not plan to apply for the program. 
Kiley Grombacher, co-founder of the California Fire Victims Law Center, is representing fire survivors in several lawsuits related to the Eaton Fire. By going through the utility’s claims process instead of letting the legal system run its course, she said, people could be leaving money on the table that they might otherwise be entitled to. If the utility is found responsible, for example, it could be required to pay punitive damages, and Southern California Edison’s program doesn’t currently mention covering long-term health monitoring.
“This is their way to get to people and get these claims cheaper instead of going through the legal system,” she said. “I’d hate to see Edison take advantage of people who have been put through this really catastrophic event and are at the lowest place in their lives.”As of May 12, the most recent data available, $5.65 billion has been paid out by insurers for about 21,000 residential property insurance claims, a process that some residents have found fraught.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010825_Eaton-Fire_TS_CM_53.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-24 20:56:09.370453

The U.S. Department of Agriculture in May requested states and contractors hand over personal data of SNAP recipients and applicants going back five years. A letter to states explained the rationale was to “ensure program integrity, including by verifying the eligibility of benefit recipients.” 
This followed President Donald Trump’s executive orders seeking to get data from state programs that receive federal funding and to stop that money from going to immigrants without legal status.
Fidelity Information Services has served as the third-party processor in Washington for the federal Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, known as SNAP. Over 20 states use Fidelity, according to court documents.
“People who need food assistance for themselves and their families should be able to trust that their data will be protected and kept private,” Attorney General Nick Brown said in a statement. “If a contractor fails to uphold the terms they’ve agreed to, we will hold them accountable under the law.”
Fidelity Information Services had told its state clients it planned to cooperate with the Trump administration. But the state’s Department of Social and Health Services, which runs SNAP here, told Fidelity not to share the Washington data. Other states similarly did not comply.
The company agreed to Washington’s wishes, but ignored requests from the Department of Social and Health Services this month to confirm the company wouldn’t turn over data, according to the lawsuit filed in Thurston County Superior Court.
Washington’s contract with Fidelity includes “strict safeguards” to protect enrollee information, the complaint says.
Fidelity didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.
The Trump administration backed off its initial request for the SNAP data in the face of a lawsuit from advocacy groups arguing the federal government was exceeding its authority and violating privacy protections.
But since then, the Department of Agriculture has taken a new approach. In late June, the department filed a notice in the Federal Register about creating a new database of information from states and third-party payment processors.
In the notice, the federal agency wrote that it plans to use the database to “ensure the integrity of Government programs, including by verifying SNAP recipient eligibility against federally maintained databases, identifying and eliminating duplicate enrollments, and performing additional eligibility and program integrity checks.”
Records shared would include names, social security numbers, dates of birth and addresses.
Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins told state agencies across the country they needed to provide her agency with their data by July 30.
Since then, state officials have reached out to Fidelity to make sure it won’t share Washington’s data, but the company hasn’t confirmed, according to the lawsuit.
“We are forced to assume FIS will breach its contract with DSHS by disclosing DSHS’s information to USDA without DSHS’s written consent,” officials reportedly told Fidelity on Tuesday.
In public comment on the Federal Register notice, the state Department of Social and Health Services said it “is concerned that we may be unable to ensure that data can be securely submitted to the new system within the timeframe outlined.”
“Until functional details of the system including frequency of reporting, data format requirements, transmission methodology, lookback period, protocols to ensure data is not used for purposes not authorized by statute, and other relevant business requirements are communicated by USDA, we cannot estimate the timeframe in which we would be able to provide the data required in the notice,” the agency continued.
Last week, Brown and more than a dozen other attorneys general urged the feds to withdraw the database proposal.
The federal government funds SNAP, which helps low-income residents pay for food via monthly benefits loaded onto Electronic Benefits Transfer, or EBT, cards. States run the program, with the assistance of third-party processors, like Fidelity.
The state also funds its own Food Assistance Program to provide benefits to people excluded from SNAP due to their immigration status. Fidelity is also the contractor for this program.
In April, the most recent month for which data is available, over 906,000 Washingtonians received a total of $167 million in SNAP benefits. That’s more than 10% of the state’s residents. Nationwide, the program serves upward of 42 million people.
The state Department of Social and Health Services declined to comment due to the pending litigation.
The attorney general is asking for a judge to immediately order Fidelity not to provide Washington’s food benefit data. The lawsuit accuses Fidelity of breach of contract, and says a data disclosure would violate the state’s anti-discrimination and consumer protection laws.
The Trump administration has made unprecedented moves in recent months to obtain state-level data that could be used to target immigrants without legal status.
Washington and other states have sued the White House over sharing personal data of Medicaid recipients with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

(Courtesy of Meg Maedgen)Floodwaters and debris flows again struck Ruidoso on Thursday afternoon. The Lincoln County emergency manager reported that five people required water rescues at about 2 p.m., according to reports made to the National weather service.
Ruidoso residents posted videos of muddy torrents of water roaring across river crossings and again carrying away homes as rains in the burn scars pushed water and debris down Rio Ruidoso, which topped 12 feet, according to river gage readings.
City officials said in social media posts that crews are working to address a new water line break, and some of the nine roads closed by flooding earlier this afternoon have reopened. Power outages affected about 330 homes for about half an hour, but power was restored.
Floods have repeatedly struck the mountain community of about 7,600 people, as seasonal monsoon rains sluice off the burn scars from the 2024 South Fork and Salt Fires. The worst so far were the deadly and catastrophic floods on July 9, which displaced several hundred people, necessitated dozens of rescues and killed three people, including two children.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump freed up additional federal funds to address the impacts from the repeated floods in a disaster declaration request the state made earlier this month.
The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning that lasts until 6 p.m. Thursday evening.

Attorneys for the Idaho Conservation League and Save the South Fork Salmon filed the lawsuit in Idaho’s Fourth District Court. 
The lawsuit involves permits for Stibnite Gold Mine, where a company called Perpetua Resources has recently received approval from the U.S. Forest Service to resume mining for gold, silver and the element antimony at the historic mine.
Stibnite Gold Mine is located in the Payette National Forest, just outside the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness near the small town of Yellow Pine in Valley County.
Mining in and around Stibnite dates back to 1899 and contributed to the World War II effort. But mining ceased by the 1990s, Stibnite’s open pit mine was abandoned and the mine site and East Fork of the South Fork of the Salmon River was polluted with arsenic and sediment, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.  
 Groups allege toxic exposure risk. Perpetua Resources, which owns the mine, defends years of regulatory review

Officials at the Idaho Conservation League said the rocks, soil and dust at Stibnite have high levels of arsenic and that resuming mining activities would emit large quantities of dust and other particulates into the air.
“Idaho DEQ’s misleading analysis of arsenic emission and cancer risks could expose anyone who works or recreates near the mine to dangerous levels of toxic and carcinogenic pollution,” Idaho Conservation League’s Will Tiedemann said in a written statement. “We should be able to trust that agencies such as DEQ will protect the public instead of misleading us about public health risks.”
The mine’s owners, Perpetua Resources, disagreed with the lawsuit and said that the project has already successfully been through a rigorous permitting and review process that lasted for years.
“The Stibnite Gold Project’s Air Permit to Construct underwent years of regulatory review, refinement, and rigorous science-based analysis,” Perpetua Resources said in a written statement Thursday. “The Project cleared the high bar set by the Department of Environmental Quality because Perpetua Resources clearly demonstrated to the agency and its board that the project meets or exceeds all requirements of state and federal law and that the project’s emissions will be protective of human health and the environment.”
Officials with the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality issued a short statement about the lawsuit.
“DEQ is reviewing the petition,” the department said Thursday. “However, since it involves active litigation, we are unable to comment at this time.” 
 Permit exempts public Stibnite Road from air pollution protections, lawsuit alleges

Conservation groups that filed the lawsuit alleged the permit fails to include adequate monitoring and other safeguards to ensure arsenic and other pollutants are kept at safe levels. The groups also say the permit exempts Stibnite Road, which the public can use, from having to comply with air pollution protections.

“Idaho DEQ continues to cater to Perpetua Resources’ attempts to bend the rules and disregard the risks from its proposed mine,” Judy Anderson of Save the South Fork Salmon said in a written statement. “Perpetua’s disregard is particularly brutal given that its workers will be living at the mine site, forced to breathe toxic air day after day. Time and again, DEQ has been given an opportunity to protect public health from toxic air pollution as the law requires, and time and again it has failed to do so.”
But the mine’s owners say the Stibnite Gold Mine has met all the necessary requirements for the permit and will operate the mine safely.
“Repeated legal challenges against the air permit have been rejected, underscoring the integrity of the permitting process,” Perpetua Resources said. “This latest judicial appeal represents yet another attempt by the same organization to reuse previously discredited claims and sow fear and uncertainty.” 
The company added it is committed to ensuring the mine protects “human health and the environment.”
“Our efforts over the past 14 years clearly demonstrate we take every opportunity to advance the public interest in many ways, including improving environmental conditions, creating positive outcomes for the communities around us, and supporting the United States’ goals and policies regarding national defense, critical minerals, and supply chain resiliency,” Perpetua Resources said.

In one instance, a Tama restaurant that was inspected in response to a complaint was found to be operating without a license. It had last been inspected in October 2022. In another instance, a Council Bluffs restaurant agreed to temporarily close in the wake of its inspection, but was open and doing business the next day when the inspector returned.
The findings are reported by the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing, which handles food-establishment inspections at the state level. Listed below are some of the more serious findings that stem from inspections at Iowa restaurants, stores, care facilities and other businesses between June 18 and July 15. (Earlier this year, DIAL began withholding from public disclosure, for eight days past the date of inspection, all food-safety inspection reports.)
The inspections department reminds the public that their reports are a “snapshot” in time, and violations are often corrected on the spot before the inspector leaves the establishment.

Perkins Restaurant & Bakery, 1505 W. 19th St., Newton — During a July 1 visit, a state inspector cited this restaurant for 10 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number. Among the problems: The person in charge was not a certified food protection manager; flying insects were observed sitting on the sliced mushrooms; and food in one of the refrigerators was holding at well above the 41-degree maximum, including diced ham and shredded cheese that was measured at 64 degrees, and sausage, tomatoes and hash browns that were measured at 65 or 66 degrees. All of the items had to be discarded.
Also, some foods were marked with preparation dates in the future, and other foods had been held past their stated discard date — including fire-roasted tomatoes with a discard date of June 20, and rice with a discard date of June 22.
The inspector also observed that the ice cream freezers and the interiors of the microwave ovens were soiled with a buildup of food, and that two refrigeration units were not operational or were in poor repair. In addition, salmon filets were being thawed while still sealed in vacuum packaging, creating a risk that any spoilage would go undetected, and there was no working, probe-type food thermometer in the building.
“Multiple flying insects were observed in the kitchen on the food-production line,” the inspector reported. “Pests were observed on food … Staff stated that fruits and vegetables are not washed or rinsed before use … Shelving and drawers are soiled with dried food debris.  Interiors of ice cream freezers have a buildup of a mold-like substance. Walls and floors in the kitchen, prep area, and dish area have a grease residue … Soiled water has pooled on the floor.”
The visit was in response to a non-illness complaint regarding general facility sanitation and pest control.  The complaint was deemed verified.
The Machine Shed, 7250 Northwest Boulevard, Davenport — During a July 15 visit, a Scott County inspector noted that multiple, unspecified food products were being held past their seven-day maximum. Also, soy sauce that was to be refrigerated was sitting on a shelf at room temperature; several food products had been left uncovered, creating a risk of contamination; half-and-half creamer at the waitress station was measured at 45 to 62 degrees and had to be discarded, as did soup that was measured at 50 degrees.
The fans in the walk-in cooler were marred by “debris and gunk buildup,” the inspector reported.
The inspection was in response to a complaint related to rats and roaches, food temperatures and cleanliness. The inspector reported that no evidence of rats, mice or roaches was observed. The inspector reported that while some items were not held at the proper temperature, other food items were being cooled properly. The complaint was deemed “verifiable,” the inspector reported.
Joy’s Mongolian Grill, 112 Hayward Ave., Ames — During a July 14 visit, a state inspector observed raw chicken and beef being stored above ready-to-eat salad bar ingredients inside a cooler, risking cross-contamination. Also, the food slicer was not being cleaned every four hours when in use, and the handwashing sink was being used to store plastic tubs.
In addition, chicken was left to thaw in a sink basin without a continuous flow of water over it; there was no thin-tipped thermometer to check the temperature of meat; and there were no chlorine test strips available to check the sanitizing solution used on food-contact surfaces.
The inspection was in response to a complaint from a customer who alleged they became ill after eating at the establishment. The complaint was deemed unverified.
According to state records, the most recent previous routine inspection conducted at Joy’s Mongolian Grill was in September 2022.
La Taqueria–The Taco Depot, 2665 Edgewood Road SW, Cedar Rapids — During a July 14 visit, a Linn County inspector concluded that employees of the establishment failed to adhere to “basic temperature parameters of cooking” and storing food. The restaurant was also operating with no certified food protection manager on site, the inspected added.
Among the problems: The staff was not checking the temperature of the food prior to cooking or holding; raw chicken was stored above beef and pork inside the walk-in cooler, risking cross-contamination; and “blood was leaking” onto a package of chicken.  Also, the temperature of the reach-in cooler was measured at 57 degrees, and all of the cooked or raw food within it was holding at 45 to 56 degrees – including “cooked guts” and cooked pork.
The inspector reported that he “advised” the restaurant to not serve any of the food that had been prepared the previous day that was still at room temperature.
According to state records, the most recent previous routine inspection conducted at La Taqueria–The Taco Depot was in July 2023.
Valley Inn Ale House, 24575 Valley Drive, Pleasant Valley — During a July 11 visit, a Scott County inspector observed a container of raw chicken being stored on top of a container of cooked chicken wings, creating a risk of cross-contamination. Also, a shallow plastic plan was holding slices of cheese at 53 to 54 degrees, and two bottles of cream-based dressings were stored at 54 to 60 degrees. At the inspector’s direction, the cheese was moved to a different pan and the dressings were placed in a refrigerated unit.
The inspector also reported that multiple temperature-controlled food products were being stored at 42 to 49 degrees and had to be moved to a properly functioning cooler. In addition, several prepared food products had to be discarded as they were being held in the walk-in cooler long past their seven-day maximum — including potato soup and baked beans that were dated June 19, and sauerkraut that was dated June 6.
“The interior of both prep coolers on the cook line were observed with a buildup of soil and food debris,” the inspector reported. “The large mixer was observed with a buildup of dried food debris. The blade of the large can opener was observed with a buildup of soil … The popcorn scoop and scoop container were observed with a buildup of leftover grease and food debris. These food contact surfaces require additional cleaning and sanitizing.”
Two knives stored as “clean” and one set of tongs from the clean-dish rack were noted to be marred by dried food debris, and the inspector observed there were no hand soap or paper towels at the handwashing sink behind the bar. Also, the walk-in freezer was marred by a buildup of ice accumulation on the walls and ceiling, and the filters located above the cooking equipment were marred by a buildup of grease and dust.
Baymont Inn and Suites, 400 Jason Way Court, Davenport — During a July 10 visit, a Scott County inspector reported the staff was not properly trained in cooling food items, the proper temperatures for holding hot and cold food, the use of gloves, or the proper method of sanitizing food-contact surfaces.
The inspector observed one employee providing breakfast service while using her phone, wearing gloves that she failed to change between tasks. Also, the waffle mix was left sitting out at room temperature and was not cooled after mixing, resulting in it being discarded.
In addition, the sausage links in the food-preparation room had been left sitting out at room temperature and were measured at 87 degrees, and the cooked scrambled eggs were sitting in the hot-holding unit at only 120 degrees.
The inspector also reported that the small refrigeration unit in the dining area was holding milk at 42 to 44 degrees rather than 41 degrees or colder. At the time of the inspection, the hotel had no chemical sanitizer on hand and the staff was unable to properly explain and demonstrate how to wash, rinse and sanitize dishes.










“Live insects observed in kitchen and storage areas ... Foods stored directly on the floor in the walk-in cooler… Kitchen floors and walls are not clean.”


– Inspector reporting on conditions at China Wok in Council Bluffs


China Wok, 2412 W. Broadway, Council Bluffs — During a July 10 visit, a state inspector concluded that due to the nature and frequency of the violations observed throughout the inspection, the person in charge was not fulfilling their duties. Cooked chicken was being held at the room temperature of 87 degrees and the restaurant had no date-marking procedures in place to ensure freshness and safety. In addition, raw chicken was stored over raw shrimp, risking cross-contamination.
“Live insects observed in kitchen and storage areas,” the inspector reported. “Foods stored directly on the floor in the walk-in cooler… Kitchen floors and walls are not clean.”  The inspection was in response to a non-illness complaint regarding general sanitation. The complaint deemed verified. “Facility voluntarily closed,” the inspector reported without elaborating.
The inspector returned the next day, on July 11, 2025, to find the restaurant open and operating — still with no date-marking procedures in place and still with raw chicken being stored over raw shrimp. “Due to the facility reopening without correcting violations and without inspector approval the facility did not demonstrate responsibilities of the permit holder,” the inspector reported.
On July 14, 2025, the inspector was back and reported finding “deceased pests” in the kitchen and storage area. The restaurant was approved for reopening.
Four months before the July inspections, in March 2025, China Wok had been cited for 10 risk-factor violations, with the inspector concluding the person in charge failed to perform their duties as evidenced by the number of violations related to cross-contamination, handwashing, date-marking and cleanliness.
The inspector found that breaded chicken previously cooked and cooled on the premises had been reheated to only 135 degrees for food service rather than a minimum of 165 degrees, and there were no date-marking procedures in place to ensure freshness and safety. Kitchen equipment was visibly soiled, and there was no sanitizer in the three-compartment sink where dishes were being washed.
The March 2025 inspection was in response to an illness complaint the state inspector deemed unverified.
La Cabana Food Truck, 1578 Court Ave., Chariton — During a July 9 visit, a state inspector found that the business had no certified food protection manager on staff. Also, raw shrimp was being stored alongside tortillas in the refrigerator, risking cross-contamination. “Not cooling hot foods — refried beans – properly,” the inspector reported. “Not sanitizing dishes… No food thermometer in the unit during the inspection.”
The Taco Depot III, 35 Miller Ave. SW, Cedar Rapids — During a July 9 visit, a Linn County inspector found the business did not employ a certified food protection manager.  The inspector observed an employee handling raw meat and then, without washing his hands, topping a taco with lettuce and tomatoes.
In addition, there was an issue with a reach-in cooler that resulted in employees having to move wings and fajita-marinated chicken to the walk-in cooler. “Chicken wings bag was noticed at shelf in the room temperature and employee stated that it was left in the room temp to thaw last night,” the inspector reported without clarification. The chicken wings, which were measured at 77 degrees, had to be discarded. Pico and unspecified “meat” that were dated June 30 were also discarded as they had been held for more than seven days.
Pizza Hut, 2311 W. Burlington Ave., Fairfield — During a July 8 visit, a state inspector reported “interior of ice machine not clean … Rack arms that hold pizza rings that come in direct contact with pizza had dried pizza sauce on them.”
Some of the violations cited by the inspector are not entirely clear, with the report stating, “Drain shelves being stored in a container that was not clean.” Chicken wings that were measured at 49 degrees had to be discarded, and the “door and door handles of coolers, hot box, proofers and other equipment not clean,” the inspector reported. “Walls and floors in establishment not clean and have food debris.”
The visit was in response to a non-illness complaint pertaining to general cleanliness and sanitation. The complaint was deemed verified. State records indicate the most recent previous inspection of the Pizza Hut was in April 2022.
Taste of China, 4212 Douglas Ave., Des Moines — During a July 8 visit, a state inspector cited the business for failing to observe protocols in handwashing, sanitation and hot-holding temperatures. The inspector observed cooked food stored in direct contact with pieces of “saturated” cardboard and noted that cooked meats were being stored without any form of temperature control. The meat products were discarded.
Also, prepared vegetables and meats were not being date-marked to ensure freshness and safety, and dishes were being washed without being sanitized. “Handwashing sink was covered with cardboard and utensils,” the inspector reported.
The visit was in response to an illness complaint that was deemed unverified.
Beaver Tap, 4050 Urbandale Ave., Des Moines — During a July 7 visit, a state inspector noted the business was not “maintaining and monitoring cold-holding temperatures or ensuring temperatures of food received … No practice of temperature monitoring.”
Inside a walk-in cooler, the inspector found turkey, queso, chicken, beans, salsa, tomato sauce, ranch dressing and other items that all measured above 41 degree and which had to be discarded. The ambient temperature of the walk-in cooler was 49 degrees, the inspector found.
The visit was in response to an illness complaint that was deemed unverified.
Three months earlier, in April 2025, inspectors cited Beaver Tap for 12 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number. At that time, the inspector reported the inspection was triggered by a non-illness complaint of an unspecified nature. “Complaint verified through conversation,” the inspector reported.
Tama-Toledo Country Club, 806 W. 13th St., Tama — During a July 3 visit, a state inspector noted that the business was operating without a license, with its previous license having expired at some point. It’s not clear from the inspector’s report how long the restaurant had been operating without a license.
The precise nature of some of the violations noted by the inspector in her published report is unclear. “Establishment offers burgers prepared from raw,” she wrote. “Burgers are not disclosed on the online menu provided by staff. Food service has been temporarily suspended by the establishment.”
The report also stated, “Whole fruits and vegetables are not washed prior to use … Interior of the walk-in cooler has a mildew-like buildup on the walls.”
The visit was triggered by a non-illness complaint the inspector deemed unverified.
State records indicate the most recent previous routine inspection of the Tama-Toledo Country Club was in October 2022.
Los Agaves, 4882 Utica Ridge Road, Davenport — During a June 18 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this establishment for 15 risk-factor violations — an exceptionally high number. Among the problems: Employees were not washing their hands between tasks; employees were not wearing gloves while handling ready-to-eat foods; raw eggs and bacon were stored above ready-to-eat items, risking cross-contamination; multiple foods were left uncovered in the kitchen, risking contamination, or were stored on the floor; vegetables stored on melting ice were measured at 50 degrees; and the fountain drink machine and the flavored-water machine were marred by “debris and gunk.”
In addition, ice buckets were being stored on the floor and were in poor condition, and the liquor room floor was marred by “debris and gunk.”
State records indicate the most recent previous routine inspection of Los Agaves was in November 2022.

Mike McClain, who spent decades as one of the most influential lobbyists in Springfield due to his close relationship with Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, has been sentenced to 24 months in prison.
McClain is the third of his “ComEd Four” co-defendants to face sentencing for his role in a yearslong bribery scheme aimed at Madigan, in which the speaker’s allies got jobs and contracts at electric utility Commonwealth Edison to grease the wheels for major legislation the company was pushing at the Statehouse.
Like Madigan, McClain plans to appeal and will be asking to stay out of prison while the legal process plays out.

CHICAGO — Longtime Springfield lobbyist Mike McClain, who spent years as a close friend and advisor to ex-Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, was sentenced to two years in prison Thursday for his role in a bribery scheme targeted at the former speaker.
McClain, 77, was the marquee defendant in 2023’s “ComEd Four” trial and the third of his co-conspirators to be sentenced for their convictions related to the yearslong scheme. As electric utility Commonwealth Edison’s top contract lobbyist, McClain pushed for the company to give jobs and contracts to Madigan allies, which the feds say greased the wheels for major legislation the company was pushing in Springfield.

Before handing down his sentence Thursday, U.S. District Judge Manish Shah directly refuted McClain’s repeated defense that he was merely engaging in normal and legal lobbying when he passed job recommendations from Madigan to ComEd. Shah said there was “nothing wrong with … building goodwill to get a seat at the table,” but said that should never have involved “phony contracts, false invoices and do-nothing jobs” involved in a cumulative $1.3 million paid to a handful of Madigan’s political allies.
“You preferred secrecy and lies,” Shah said, pointing out that McClain had not only been the architect of the ghost contractor program but also paid one of the speaker’s most valuable political workers under his own contract from 2012 to 2014. “You preferred Mr. Madigan. You chose his way and the consequences of that choice are yours to bear.”
Sentencing hearings in the ComEd Four case were put off for more than two years, in part to let the related corruption trial of Madigan himself play out. McClain was also a defendant in that trial, but the former lobbyist walked out of the Dirksen Federal Courthouse without a conviction after the jury delivered a mixed verdict, including deadlocking on all six counts pertaining to both Madigan and McClain.
Madigan was sentenced to 7½ years in prison last month for his convictions on bribery and other corruption charges, most of which stemmed from the ComEd scheme.

In hundreds of FBI wiretapped calls played at both trials, McClain constantly referenced his relationship with the speaker, which stretched back to the 1970s when they were both young Democratic state representatives. As he explained on one recording, he called Madigan “our friend” in order to minimize others overhearing him talking about the powerful speaker. In other key calls, he referred to Madigan as his “real client,” and called himself the speaker’s “agent.”
But for all the secretly taped conversations presented as evidence in the case, McClain attorney Patrick Cotter on Thursday told the judge: “You never heard him ask Mike Madigan to help with legislation.”
“He never did that,” Cotter said, echoing his arguments from both trials that McClain helped ComEd pass legislation through sophisticated and expensive lobbying campaigns that often took years.
Cotter, who has represented McClain since the day in May 2019 when the lobbyist’s home was searched as part of a coordinated FBI effort, said his client’s story hasn’t changed since the feds asked him to cooperate.
“Mike was told six years ago that if he would just say he intended to bribe (Madigan), he’d be much better off. He could help himself,” Cotter said. “But he couldn’t say it then, and he can’t say it today. Because in his heart, he does not believe it is true.”
The attorney said McClain “has paid a very large price” for refusing to go along with the government’s story “as some others did” — a reference to government witnesses including former ComEd executive Fidel Marquez, who agreed to wear a wire on McClain and their colleagues. Marquez testified in both trials and will likely see his single conspiracy charge dropped.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Diane MacArthur, a prosecutor in both cases, said McClain’s willingness to be used as a conduit between Madigan and ComEd — McClain’s biggest client — subverted the autonomy of not just a private business but a utility regulated by the state of Illinois.
“It allowed Madigan to use ComEd like a benefit fulfillment warehouse, with Michael McClain taking Madigan’s requests, boxing them up and delivering them straight to the speaker of the Illinois House,” she said.
Shah echoed MacArthur’s sentiments before handing down his sentence, referencing how decades ago, a division within Chicago’s Department of Streets and Sanitation — where the speaker’s father and eventually a young Madigan worked — was nicknamed “Madigan Electric” for the speaker’s ability “to get people jobs in that bureau.”
“It seems like with your help, ‘Madigan Electric’ included ComEd itself,” the judge said.
Beyond the $1.3 million paid out in do-nothing contracts with Madigan allies, ComEd was also pressured to hire constituents of Madigan’s and those connected to those in the speaker’s orbit. McClain could be pushy about those applicants, as well as students from Madigan’s 13th Ward on Chicago’s Southwest Side, who were hired as interns through a separate process than competing candidates.
McClain got ComEd CEO Anne Pramaggiore involved in other matters, including the speaker’s push for a political ally’s appointment to ComEd’s board and the renewal of a multi-year contract for a law firm owned by Democratic fundraiser and Madigan ally Victor Reyes.
MacArthur on Thursday quoted from a 2016 email McClain wrote to Pramaggiore about the flagging contract negotiations, which he warned might “provoke a reaction from our Friend.”

“I know the drill and so do you. If you do not get involve(d) and resolve this issue of 850 hours for his law firm per year then he will go to our Friend,” McClain wrote of Reyes. “Our Friend will call me and then I will call you. Is this a drill we must go through?”
Earlier this week, Pramaggiore was also sentenced to two years in prison, while former ComEd executive John Hooker received an 18-month sentence last week. Lobbyist Jay Doherty, who agreed to be used as a pass-through for the clouted do-nothing contractors, faces sentencing in early August.

All four co-defendants received across-the-board guilty verdicts after their 2023 trial, but Shah earlier this year tossed the convictions on most of the bribery counts, only leaving in place an overarching conspiracy charge. Their sentences are based on that count, as well as charges involving having falsified ComEd’s books and records in the co-conspirators’ efforts to further the bribery scheme.

Prosecutors won’t pursue a retrial on the bribery charges and have been asking Shah to dismiss the counts after each sentencing.
Though the feds had originally asked Shah to impose a near-six-year sentence on McClain, Pramaggiore’s and Hooker’s lighter sentences — along with the former lobbyist’s significant health challenges — prompted prosecutors to downgrade that recommendation to 36 months, which they announced in court on Thursday.

Unlike hefty fines the judge ordered from Pramaggiore and Hooker, the judge declined to fine McClain; Cotter had referenced the “financial ruin” that the last six years had brought on McClain, and Shah agreed the former lobbyist didn’t have the means to pay a large sum.
McClain was stoic while the judge read his sentence but began crying as he started hugging his similarly tearful family after the hearing, starting with his wife, Cinda. Later, McClain left the courthouse with Cotter and his family, avoiding reporters gathered in the lobby.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)To cover a $10 million deficit, the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) on Thursday laid out a wide-ranging plan for service cuts.
And just how deep are they? Well, it might be easier to say what’s not on the chopping block.
That’s because the agency is proposing to cut or reduce 58 of its 67 routes — around 86% — ranging from connections to the Block Island Ferry, weekend service to Roger Williams Park Zoo, and the trolleys connecting Newport’s North End to the city’s beaches.
Even the agency’s top performing route won’t be spared reductions, according to the plans released as RIPTA’s board of directors held its monthly meeting early Thursday afternoon. The R-Line — which connects Cranston, Providence and Pawtucket — would run every 20 minutes on weekends instead of every 15 minutes during the day and every 30 minutes at night.


Proposed service cuts will affect the following routes:
1, 3, 4, 6, 9x, 12x, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 50, 51, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59x, 60, 61x, 63, 64, 65x, 66, 68, 69, 71, 72, 73, 75, 76, 78, 80, 87, 88, 89, 92, 95x, 203, 231, 281, 301 and the R-Line.

Eleven routes would be totally eliminated. Thirty routes would see reductions in trip frequency or number of trips. A half dozen routes serving park and rides would be eliminated or have round trips reduced.
There would be no weekend service anymore for nine routes — 4 (Pawtuxet Village/Warwick Neck); 6 (Prairie/Roger Williams Park Zoo); 13 (Coventry/Arctic/CCRI); 14 (West Bay); 29 (CCRI Warwick/Conimicut); 55 (Admiral/Providence College); 71 (Broad St./Pawtucket Ave); Flex 203 (URI/Narragansett/S. Kingstown); and Flex 231 (South Aquidneck)
Three routes — 18 (Providence’s Union Avenue); 58 (Mineral Spring/North Providence); and 64 (Newport/URI Kingston) — would no longer have Saturday service. 
Five routes — 3 (Warwick Avenue/Oakland Beach); 6 (Prairie/Roger Williams Park Zoo); 16 (Bald Hill/NEIT/Quonset); 35 (Rumford/Newport Ave); and 63 (Newport’s Broadway/Middletown Shops) — would lose Sunday service.
“Obviously we don’t want to do these reductions, but frankly we don’t have a choice,” RIPTA CEO Christopher Durand told the board. “At this point, we’re finalizing exactly what this all will look like — these changes are substantial.”

But just how many jobs are on the line remains unclear. Durand had previously told reporters that between 90 to 100 employees could be let go, but walked back his projections Thursday.
“I don’t have a number at this point,” he said.
“We don’t want to lose anybody,” Durand added. “We’ve done a lot of work to bring people in over the past year.”
Proposed service changes arrive four days before a series of public hearings are scheduled to begin across the state. The first will be held Monday, July 28 at the Community College of Rhode Island’s Knight Campus in Warwick from noon to 1:30 p.m. 
After those hearings, Durand said the board will consider approving the final plan when it holds a special meeting Aug. 7.
Should the panel move forward with the recommendations, the cuts would take effect Sept.13.
Durand told reporters after the meeting that the agency relied on a still-to-be-completed independent efficiency study to guide what service cuts would need to be made.
A June 16 draft memo from the study suggested reallocating resources away from providing bus service in rural communities with low ridership to more populated low-income areas, along with more service for Providence residents who commute to jobs outside of the city. It also recommended the agency increase its $2-per-ride fare, which has been in place since 2010. 
But Durand told the board a fare increase will remain off the table — at least for now.
“That is something we’re going to take a little more time to understand to make sure whatever we do is thoughtful and effective,” Durand said. 
The agency plans to conduct a study to analyze impacts of a potential fare increase on “ridership, revenue, and equity,” according to its announcement of the proposed service cuts.

Closed door session lasts over an hour
RIPTA’s board spent only eight minutes discussing the proposed cuts when it reconvened after over an hour behind closed doors. Chairman Peter Alviti Jr., the director of the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT), acknowledged “challenges ahead” in his remarks upon the return to open session.
Those challenges stem from a $17.6 million deficit in the state budget taking effect July 1 approved by the General Assembly. Lawmakers pared down an initial $32.6 million hole in Gov. Dan McKee’s proposed fiscal 2026 budget released in January. The General Assembly eventually propped up RIPTA with nearly $15 million in annual revenue from an additional 2-cent increase in the state’s gas tax and upping the agency’s share of the state’s Highway Maintenance Account.
RIPTA administrators managed to reduce the shortfall to $10 million thanks to what Durand called a “favorable price lock” in diesel fuel, along with a positive market performance for the agency’s pension plan. 
“Gov. McKee is stranding bus riders,” Liza Burkin, board president of the Providence Streets Coalition, told reporters after the meeting. “This will literally strand folks by the side of the road, strand them at home, make [them] unable to get groceries, to go to medical appointments, to get to work.”
Alviti said the state’s budget provides RIPTA with “a mission to accomplish.”
“We as an agency need to adapt,” he said.
Durand told reporters the agency is still eyeing other ways to claw out of the deficit. One idea, he said, is picking back up paratransit trips that had been outsourced to taxi companies — a move Durand projects could save RIPTA about $2.4 million. 
Burkin and other transit advocates urged RIPTA leaders to avoid service cuts by exploring all alternatives — including asking RIDOT to redirect some of its federally funded State Transportation Improvement Program, a $9.5 billion, 10-year plan focused on roads, bridges, and pedestrian infrastructure.
“We need to triage,” she said. 
Durand told reporters he would look into the idea, but was unsure of its feasibility.
“At the end of the day, federal funds can’t be used for operations,” he said. 
So what routes escaped untouched?
Routes not affected: Qx, 40, 67, 10x, 24L. Same with on-demand service in Westerly, Pascaog/Slatersville, and West Warwick/Coventry are also untouched.
The South County Express Beach Bus (routes 45, 46, and 47), which ends the season on Aug. 24, was also spared. The route connects Central Falls, Pawtucket and Providence, Woonsocket, North Providence and Cranston to the Scarborough, Wheeler, and Salty Brine state beaches during summer weekends and holidays.

(Courtesy U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Maxwell Daigle) New Mexico state officials have asked a state court to order Cannon Air Force to allow inspectors to test for toxic substances, after Cannon officials on July 15 prohibited them from doing so.
Inspectors had sought to sample for per-and-polyfluoroalkyl substances — a class of toxic chemicals that have contaminated multiple groundwater sites in the state. While health effects are still being studied, PFAS exposure has been linked to increased cancer rates, decreased fertility and immune system damage.
In December 2018, New Mexico regulators issued a permit to Cannon Air Force Base in December 2018, requiring cleanup of PFAS contamination of the air, soil, surface water and groundwater stemming from decades of use of PFAS-laded firefighting foams. The following year,  the U.S. Department of Defense filed suit and alleged New Mexico’s efforts to mandate cleanup of PFAS contamination in the Ogalla Aquifer overstepped the state’s authority on hazardous waste.
PFAS contamination from Cannon infiltrated nearby dairy cows in Clovis, resulting in the euthanasia and disposal of more than 3,000 cows in October 2022. Recent studies found the plants and animals at Holloman Lake outside of Alamogordo contain the highest levels of measured PFAS in the world.
New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez and the New Mexico Environment Department submitted a motion to a Santa Fe judge Wednesday arguing for immediate access to the base and an order requiring air force officials to follow terms of the hazardous waste permit. The motion was an update to the new lawsuit filed against Cannon Air Force Base in June.
Cannon officials, however, said in a July 18 statement that the denial was prompted by the ongoing federal litigation.
“While NMED sought to collect samples for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), the Air Force could not authorize PFAS sampling due to ongoing litigation over NMED’s authority to regulate PFAS as a hazardous waste,” the statement read. “However, Cannon did oﬀer sampling opportunities for hazardous waste covered by its permit.”
When reached for further comment, Major. Jaclyn Pienkowski, a spokesperson for Cannon Air Force Base referred Source NM back to the July 18 statement.
State officials said the denial violated the permit and state laws, including a measure lawmakers passed in the 2025 session. House Bill 140 expanded the state’s authority to require the cleanup of firefighting foams containing PFAS at military bases in New Mexico.

“Denying access to state inspectors to sample for toxic PFAS contamination while claiming to value relationships and embrace transparency is downright insulting to New Mexicans,” Environment Secretary James Kenney said in a statement. “For years, the U.S. Air Force’s promises have contradicted their harmful actions towards communities and regulators — a tired pattern from Washington bureaucrats with no connection to our families, land, or water.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1000w_q95.webp,,,2025-07-24 18:56:39.579728

The State Water Resources Control Board advance a controversial, Newsom-backed agreement in a new proposal, which qualifies as a major development in the long-running debate about delta water use. 


After decades of deterioration and ecological collapse in the heart of California’s water system, state regulators today embraced the Newsom administration’s controversial plan to overhaul how farms and cities take water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and rivers that feed it. 
It’s a major development in a long-running battle over how much water must flow through the Delta for the survival of iconic Chinook salmon, sturgeon and other species — and how much can be tapped for tens of millions of Californians and vast tracts of Central Valley farmland. 
On one side are conservationists, the fishing industry, Delta communities and Native tribes: They want stringent rules requiring cities and farms to take less water from the imperiled watershed. 
On the other are Gov. Gavin Newsom, major urban and agricultural water suppliers, and the state and federal agencies tasked with exporting Delta water to farms and cities further south. They back a $2.9 billion pact reached three years ago that would allow water users to help restore fish habitat and forgo some water, rather than face strict requirements mandating how much water must remain in the rivers. 
Today, staff with the State Water Resources Control Board threw their support behind the pact as the major path forward in a long-awaited update they released today. Next comes a period of public comment and hearings before the water board’s five governor-appointed members will consider adopting the plan. 
The pact, backed by $1.5 million in state funding, is called the Healthy Rivers and Landscapes program but better known as the “voluntary agreements.” Under today’s plan, if adopted, those who don’t sign on to the deal would face minimum flow requirements, which also would be considered if the voluntary agreements fail to show “sufficient benefits” at the end of an eight year term. 
The stakes are high for revamping the Delta’s rulebook as fish populations plummet, commercial salmon fishing faces an unprecedented third year of shutdowns, and farmers struggle with unpredictable water supplies and restrictions on groundwater pumping.  
Participants in the deal — including Westlands Water District, the nation’s largest agricultural supplier —  say the Newsom-backed voluntary agreements will keep water flowing for farms and cities, and promote restoration of floodplains and other river features. 
“It’s a false narrative that it’s people in cities, against agriculture, against fish. I think we as Californians need all of that to be able to function,” said Allison Febbo, general manager of Westlands Water District. “We can actually maintain water delivery for our cities and our farms, but we can actually also be pretty thoughtful for our ecological systems.” 
But opponents are dismayed. They say that the voluntary agreements provide too little water and too little habitat to protect the fragile Delta ecosystem and the fish, industries and residents that rely on it.  
“This latest plan is a shocking display of cowardice,” said Jon Rosenfield, science director of San Francisco Baykeeper. 
“Even if the pledged water is delivered as promised, which is a big if, it barely moves the needle on the lack of adequate flows for fish, wildlife, fisheries and the communities that depend on those things,” Rosenfield said. 
A long-running battle
California’s Bay-Delta has long been the epicenter of the state’s water wars. The watershed, formed by the Sacramento and San Joaquin river systems, stretches from about Fresno to beyond the Oregon border and drains about 40% of California. 
It’s the core of the state’s water supply, supports much of the state’s imperiled commercial salmon fishery, and is home to hundreds of native plant and animal species.  
For years, state regulators have warned that the Delta is experiencing an “ecological crisis” with a “prolonged and precipitous decline in numerous native species,” including endangered winter-run Chinook salmon and the tiny Delta smelt. 
State analyses report that current requirements governing water quality and flow in the watershed have “failed to protect fish and wildlife” and must be updated “in an expedited manner to halt and reverse the ecosystem collapse.” 
But the rulebook hasn’t been meaningfully updated in 30 years. State regulators adopted new flow requirements in 2018 for portions of the Lower San Joaquin River and its major tributaries, but they have been tied up by litigation and, according to the Legislative Analyst’s Office, by “consideration of (voluntary agreements).” They have not yet been implemented.
Now, regulators are considering updates for the rest of the watershed. This much larger portion includes the Sacramento River and its tributaries as well as the Calaveras, Cosumnes, and Mokelumne Rivers and the San Francisco Bay-Delta.
Newsom has long pushed for a deal with water-users rather than strict mandates. 
“Our first task is to cross the finish line on real agreements to save the Sacramento-San Joaquin Bay Delta,” he said in his first State of the State address. “We must get this done — for the resilience of our mighty rivers, the stability of our agriculture sector, and the millions who depend on this water every day.”

State officials say that they expect this approach will engender more cooperation and avoid lawsuits that could delay action. 
“Sometimes people say, ‘Well, isn’t it just politics and not science that’s driving this?’” Wade Crowfoot, California Secretary of Natural Resources, which supports the agreements, told CalMatters in April 2024 before a series of workshops about the agreements. “And I say, ‘Well, ultimately, in California water, the decisions are often validated through legal challenge.’”  
The voluntary agreements are the culmination of years of negotiations with powerful urban and agricultural suppliers such as the Westlands Water District and the agencies that make up the State Water Contractors. Though called “voluntary,” water board executive director Eric Oppenheimer says they would still be legally enforceable. 
The proposal meters out an average of up to 700,000 acre-feet of water in certain years, according to state officials — enough to supply up to 2.5 million households for a year.  
The amount varies, though depending on how wet or dry the year. In critically dry years, several rivers including the Sacramento, Yuba, Feather would receive no additional water. Water could be purchased if sellers are willing to provide additional flows, said Jennifer Pierre, general manager for the State Water Contractors.  
It also calls for restoration of around 45,000 acres of spawning, rearing and floodplain habitats, backed by about $1.5 billion in state funding, around $600 million from the water providers, and around $740 million expected from federal funds, Pierre said. 
By also promoting habitat restoration under the voluntary agreements, “we think we can achieve significant ecosystem improvements, and we think it can be done with a lower water supply impact,” said Eric Oppenheimer, executive director of the State Water Resources Control Board. 
But, he said, at the end of eight years, if the “board made a determination that the voluntary agreement pathway wasn’t achieving sufficient benefits, it could then start a process to shift over to the regulatory pathway.” 
The regulatory pathway, by contrast, calls for maintaining flows of 35% to 55% of the amount of water that the rivers would have carried were they not dammed or diverted — an amount called unimpaired flow. For some, rain-fed tributaries that provide municipal supplies, there would be no flow requirement at all in the driest conditions. 
Water suppliers say stringent requirements would strike a major blow to their ability to provide water for cities and farms, and touted the habitat projects supported by the voluntary agreements.
“We’re talking … about significant reductions in delivery to the San Joaquin Valley during dry years,” Pierre said. “I would never argue that fish don’t need water. They of course do. But in that water are things like refuge and food and adequate temperatures that are really being promoted.” 
Like a fish needs water
Opponents, however, say there is far too little water provided in the voluntary agreements, and that the updated flow requirements are also far weaker than previous proposals. 
State officials did not provide a comparison between the two pathways. Oppenheimer said that the comparison is not “apples to apples” because of the inclusion of habitat restoration efforts under the voluntary agreements.
“I know everybody wants to know how the two compare when you compare flow. But you know, from my perspective, it’s not a valid comparison,” he said. “There is no translation between habitat and water.” 
That, environmentalists say, is the problem. Fish habitat, they say, needs to be wet. 
“For fish, flow is the habitat. There is no evidence that restoring floodplains or tidal marshes, in the absence of adequate flow, produces any benefit,” Rosenfield said. 
Conservationists and fishing organizations also fear that the voluntary agreements would pave the way for more water to be diverted from the Delta by future water projects such as Sites Reservoir and the deeply controversial Delta tunnel. 
A state analysis, published in 2023, reported that without additional protections, “existing flows may be reduced in the future, particularly with climate change and additional water development.” 
Opponents have also warned that thousands of acres of the habitat restoration promised under the voluntary agreements are already in the works, which they say reduces how much the deal would benefit fish species. (Pierre counters that this is a plus of the agreements, and reflects early action during negotiations.)
And critics say that the voluntary agreements require money and cooperation from a federal government that has slashed environmental programs and called for “Putting People over Fish” in a memorandum issued on President Trump’s first day in office. 
“This is a sad day for the State Water Board and one more on a long list of bad days for salmon,” Scott Artis, executive director, Golden State Salmon Association, said in a statement. “Commercial fishing in California has been closed for three years because of unsustainable water diversions. This looks like a plan to kill California’s most important wild salmon runs and fishing jobs.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/101512-Salmon-American-River-DWR-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C702&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-24 18:56:39.579728

Free.,Trump framework for compensating college athletes limits some payments,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-framework-compensating-college-athletes-limits-some-payments,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday that bars payments from university boosters and some other private-sector donors to college athletes.The NCAA changed its rules in 2021 to allow athletes to profit from their own name, image and likeness, or NIL. A White House fact sheet Thursday said third-party payments from boosters and other private donors “created a chaotic environment that threatens the financial and structural viability of college athletics.”“Waves of recent litigation against collegiate athletics governing rules have eliminated limits on athlete compensation, pay-for-play recruiting inducements, and transfers between universities, unleashing a sea change that threatens the viability of college sports,” the order said.A patchwork of laws exists across states, with no federal NIL law in place. A federal judge in June approved the terms of a nearly $2.8 billion antitrust settlement, which paved the way for schools to directly pay athletes.“While changes providing some increased benefits and flexibility to student-athletes were overdue and should be maintained, the inability to maintain reasonable rules and guardrails is a mortal threat to most college sports,” the executive order said. According to the White House fact sheet, the order’s prohibition of “third-party, pay-for-play payments” does not apply to “legitimate, fair-market-value compensation that a third party provides to an athlete, such as for a brand endorsement.”The order also seeks to preserve and expand “opportunities for scholarships and collegiate athletic competition in women’s and non-revenue sports” and calls on the secretary of Labor and the National Labor Relations Board to clarify the “status” of college-athletes.A day before the order, two U.S. House panels advanced a measure that would set a national framework for college athletes’ compensation and bar them from being recognized as employees.That bill, the Student Compensation and Opportunity through Rights and Endorsements Act, or ‘‘SCORE Act,” was approved in the House Energy and Commerce and Education and Workforce committees, which both have jurisdiction.",,,,2025-07-24 18:56:39.579728

Baker, Glasser and Marcus, who worked together at the Washington Post during President Trump’s first term, described an authoritarian takeover of the country.
The post At Wyoming forum, top journalists describe ‘real fear factor’ surrounding Trump administration appeared first on WyoFile .","Three of the country’s top political journalists described President Donald Trump on Wednesday in Jackson as an unreliable fact witness and characterized him as “Nixon’s revenge.”
Trump is accomplishing “things that Nixon was unable to do,” said Susan Glasser, a staff writer and columnist for The New Yorker. He is undertaking “the deconstruction of the post-Watergate state,” she said, dismantling “everything that was put in place” to prevent a recurrence of Nixon’s crimes.
Peter Baker, chief White House correspondent for The New York Times and Glasser’s husband, said Trump is “a completely unreliable fact witness [who] will change a story.” Trump makes for “a fascinatingly frustrating interview,” said Baker, who interviewed the president with Glasser twice after his 2020 election defeat.
“There’s a real fear factor in Washington. It reminds us of Moscow.” Peter Baker
Glasser and Baker spoke as former Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus moderated an hour-long conversation at the Center for the Arts in Jackson, hosted by the Jackson Hole Book Festival. The three worked together at the Post during Trump’s first term and Marcus, who splits her time between Jackson and Maryland, is a festival board member.
Baker and Glasser referenced their book “The Divider,” about the first term, which, Glasser said, reveals “the essence of Trump.” For their book, the couple found willing interview subjects — “all Republican … from inside the room,” Glasser said. Those who talked right after Trump’s first term likely did so assuming he was not coming back.
The situation today is different.
“There’s a real fear factor in Washington,” Baker said, including sources’ fear of physical harm. “It reminds us of Moscow,” where the couple was posted from 2001-2004 as Vladimir Putin was consolidating power.
Sources “are afraid,” Baker said. “They fear retribution. It’s hard to blame them.”
Trump is laying down conditions to unravel democracy, Glasser said, undermining the institutions that uphold it while leaving their shells as facades.
Trump ‘most transparent’
Baker reasoned that Trump was “the most transparent” of the five presidents he has covered, because what he talked about during his first term — like eliminating courts or judicial authority — Trump is trying to achieve in his second.
That, and a discussion about the coverage of former President Joe Biden’s age and acuity, were two moments of respite in the evening of critique. Baker said “no” when Marcus asked whether the press had dropped the ball in reporting on Biden’s mental state, then qualified his remarks.
“They hated our age stories,” Baker said of the Biden White House’s reaction to Post reporting. “We wrote about this a lot.”
Biden’s slow decline didn’t stand out in day-to-day comparisons, he said. Baker recalled a speech Biden delivered that didn’t strike any of his regular observers as unusual. But a colleague who had not attended a Biden speech in person for a year clearly saw a change in the then-president’s capabilities.
That was “something we had not picked up on in our reporting,” Baker said. The other reporter “had this perspective I didn’t,” a perspective that became the dominant national viewpoint after Biden’s disastrous debate with Trump.
Beyond Trump’s transparency and the Biden-age story, the three speakers focused on what they described as Trump’s anti-democratic and ethically abnormal actions — what Glasser called “a parade of unthinkables.”
ABC’s and CBS’ lawsuit settlements with Trump underscore the culture of fear faced by reporters whose institutions don’t back them up, the two said. Marcus herself resigned from the Washington Post after an editor spiked one of her columns. She received the evening’s loudest applause when an audience member said her resignation reflected the “highest quality of journalism.”
Glasser and Baker said they don’t think Rupert Murdoch, owner of the Wall Street Journal, will fold like other news outlets have. The Journal in 2018 broke the story on Trump’s hush-money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, they pointed out. It has scooped others with recent revelations about Trump’s relationship with deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Trump has sued the Journal for publishing the latest stories, but Baker doesn’t think Murdoch will follow ABC and CBS and settle. “Rupert Murdoch, I think, will not go [that] way,” he said.
Today at White House and presidential events, there’s instant hostility toward the press, Baker said. “They’re trying to use you as a prop.”
Trump borrowed a phrase from Stalin when he labeled the press “enemies of the people,” Glasser said. The intent is to separate journalists from the rest of the population and define them as the opposition.
“It is a public-interest profession,” she said of her job before quoting former Post Editor Marty Baron: “We’re not at war with the Trump administration, we’re at work.”

Tony Evers announced in a two-minute video Thursday that he would not be running for reelection — launching the first open race for governor in Wisconsin since 2010. 
The decision came after months of waiting as Evers said he wouldn’t make a decision until the 2025-27 state budget was completed. After he signed the budget in early July, anticipation of his decision increased along with debate over whether he would be the best candidate among Democrats. 
Evers said there was “no question” he could win another term, but said that “whether I’d win or not has never been part of my calculus about running again.” He said he won’t run in order to spend time with  his family.
“Wisconsin, the only thing I love more than being your governor is being a husband, a dad, and a grandpa,” Evers said. “For five decades, my family has sacrificed to give me the gift of service. They’re my world. And I owe it to them to focus on doing all the things we enjoy and love doing together.” 
Evers was elected to the office in 2018 — ousting Gov. Scott Walker in a close election. Previously he  served as state superintendent of public instruction from 2009-2019 and was known for his advocacy for public education. 
During his time in office, Evers has worked with Republican and Democratic lawmakers to write four state budgets, using  his partial veto power extensively at times, and signed new, fairer legislative maps into law.

     Democrats on Evers not running
Democrats expressed appreciation for Evers’ service and are now considering the future, including who might run for the office.
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said Evers’ “commitment to every kid’s education, our teachers, and public schools will undoubtedly shape our future for the better and be a cornerstone of his legacy” and that his “steady hand led us through a once-in-a-generation pandemic, and Wisconsin came out the other side with a strong economy, record low unemployment, and a strong sense of community that bonds us all.” 
Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) said Evers’ election in 2019 “signaled the end of an era of right-wing governance and a new path forward for Wisconsin” and commended him for vetoing Republican bills that would have “harmed Wisconsinites” and working under split government to get “get things done where possible.” She said she respects his decision to do what’s right for him and his family. 
“Making the decision to step away from public office is not easy,” Neubauer said. “As Democrats, we will continue the work of ensuring the will of the people is the law of the land.”
Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) said Evers’ career has been built on “hard work, compassion, service to others, and family.” 
“He has sought and found practical solutions to tough problems, worked across the aisle when he could, and, when that was not possible, he has fought hard for Democratic principles in the face of Republican extremism,” Hesselbein said. 
Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) told the Wisconsin Examiner that Evers has been a great “goalkeeper” during his time in office, but said Democrats need someone that will try to make goals. He expressed immense disappointment in the budget deal that Evers and Senate Democrats came to with Republican lawmakers and recently penned a letter, which has received over 40 signatures, laying out expectations for a potential 2026 candidate.
“I for one am glad that the governor is reading the room and ready to pass the torch to the next generation to step forward and to lead in this fight,” Larson said. “Now that he is moving on and not running, I’m excited to see who steps forward and what kind of platforms they are going to have to basically meet the moment, not just on K-12 education, but higher ed, on tackling climate change… [and] talking about health care.” 
Larson said he thinks the decision to step down could help build enthusiasm among the party’s base, which could bode well as Senate Democrats work to flip the Senate to a Democratic majority for the first time in 16 years. 
“It builds an energy, and it builds an excitement,” Larson said.
Larson said he isn’t worried about how a new candidate will match up with a Republican candidate. 
“The Republicans, [who are] all lining up behind a right-wing zealot who demands loyalty and has supporters who have driven themselves to be irrational and violent…,” Larson said, referencing Trump, “they’re all going down with the ship.”
This will be the first open election for Wisconsin governor since 2010. Some of the Democrats who have been mentioned as potential candidates include Attorney General Josh Kaul, Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, state Sen. Kelda Roys, former Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Ben Wikler and former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes.
Rodriguez thanked Evers for his work in a statement, saying he has led the state with “integrity, compassion, and a deep belief in doing what’s right – even when it’s hard.”  
“There’s still work to do to make sure every family in Wisconsin has a fair shot at a better life – and I’m ready to roll up my sleeves and get to work,” Rodriguez said. 
Crowley told WISN-12 just before the announcement that he needs to speak with his family as he considers whether to run. In a statement, he praised Evers for his work that has supported Milwaukee County, including the passage of Act 12, which reworked local government funding in Wisconsin and gave Milwaukee the ability to levy a new sales tax.
“I’m especially grateful for Governor Evers’ partnership in passing Wisconsin Act 12 and securing new revenues and resources for Milwaukee County, putting us on a path to long-term fiscal stability for generations to come,” Crowley said. “Simply put, Milwaukee County is stronger, healthier, and better off because of the leadership and partnership of Governor Evers.”
According to the Associated Press, Barnes, who lost the 2022 U.S. Senate race against Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, said he is “considering” running. 
Republicans pan Evers’ record  
Two Republican candidates, Washington Co. Executive Josh Schoemann and Whitefish Bay businessman Bill Berrien, have already launched their campaigns. Other Republicans are still considering whether to run, including U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany. 
Schoemann said in a statement that he wouldn’t be “outworked” while running for governor and said any Democratic candidate that runs “will be more of the same status quo but even more extreme than Gov. Evers.” 
“I look forward to contrasting my record of cutting taxes, reducing government and innovative reforms with their woke, radical agenda,” Schoemann said. 
Berrien told reporters on a Zoom call that Evers stepping down would not change his approach to the race. He jumped into the race earlier this month, declaring that he is similar to President Donald Trump, as an “outsider” and businessman. He is the CEO and owner of Pindel Global Precision Inc. and Liberty Precision New Berlin, which are contract manufacturers that make machined parts.
“We have a vision and a mission of where we need to take Wisconsin,” Berrien said. “Now that it’s not going to Gov. Evers that I’m running against, it’s going to be someone probably sharply like him, so, you know, we’ve got our plan. We are aggressively getting around the state, listening and crafting a vision and a strategy.” 
Tiffany fell short of saying whether he would run for the office, but said Evers “leaves behind a legacy of decline” and said the state needs to change course before “we end up like MN and IL.” 
Former Gov. Scott Walker also made a cryptic post on social media following the announcement, saying “interesting” with a photo of a red hat with the slogan “Make Wisconsin Great Again” and the numbers 45 and 47, referencing nonconsecutive terms served by President Donald Trump.
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) took a more cordial tone, wishing Evers and his wife well.
“No matter what side of the aisle we stand on, the decision to run for statewide office comes with many personal sacrifices that are worthy of recognition,” Vos said. “I want to thank Governor Evers for his service to the state of Wisconsin.”
Republicans have struggled to win statewide elections in Wisconsin in recent years, with the candidates the party supported losing  the last three state Supreme Court races, the last two governor’s races, the last two state superintendent races and the last U.S. Senate race.
Republican Party of Wisconsin Chair Brian Schimming said in a statement on  Evers’ decision to step aside that he  “saw the writing on the wall: Wisconsinites are fed up with far-left policies.” 
“While Wisconsin Democrats continue to lose the approval of voters, Republicans are already working on winning up and down the ballot,” Schimming said.

The complaint from the Equal Protection Project targets 32 scholarships at FSU funded by donors, most of whom prefer the award go to Black students. The group alleges the scholarships violate the Civil Rights Act and the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, according to a Thursday press release.
Another complaint from EPP — founded by Cornell Law Professor William Jacobson, who has gained prominence by attacking diversity programs in education — prompted Trump’s DOE Office for Civil Rights to launch an investigation against the University of Miami and four other higher education institutions.
A spokesperson for FSU didn’t respond to Florida Phoenix’s requests for comment.
DOE announced the investigation into the University of Miami’s scholarships for academically eligible students lacking permanent legal status in a press release Wednesday. FSU is a public university while UM  is private.
“Neither the Trump Administration’s America first policies nor the Civil Rights Act of 1964’s prohibition on national origin discrimination permit universities to deny our fellow citizens the opportunity to compete for scholarships because they were born in the United States,” said Craig Trainorhe, acting assistant secretary for Civil Rights, in a statement. “As we mark President Trump’s historic six months back in the White House, we are expanding our enforcement efforts to protect American students and lawful residents from invidious national origin discrimination of the kind alleged here.”

LISTEN: Hear Northwest Arkansas residents share, in their own words, why they attended the rally and what concerns they have about immigration policies. 			




The Trump administration deported more than 200 Venezuelans to a notorious Salvadoran prison called Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, in March. The deportations were conducted without giving the Venezuelans time to have their cases heard by a judge, which is part of due process. The U.S. paid El Salvador $6 million to detain the men. 
A wrongly deported Maryland man held in the prison until he was returned to the U.S. in June detailed psychological and physical torture in court documents. Last week, Venezuela released 10 jailed U.S. citizens and permanent residents in exchange for many of the migrants deported to CECOT, according to the Associated Press.  
Lisa Childs, co-leader of Indivisible NWA, said protesters held signs along one of Springdale’s busiest roads Thursday because “we are very upset about kidnapping United States residents.” Childs said she’s “very glad” Venezuelan prisoners were released, “but we want that not to ever happen again.” 
“That’s not acceptable. That’s not how due process works,” she said. “I’m a lawyer and that’s not how you should do things in the United States.”
Dallas Morrison said he participated in Thursday’s protest because he could not just sit at home with everything happening in the country. 
“All that’s in the news, I was just disgusted by it, so I just had to do something,” Morrison said. “This is maybe small, maybe big, I don’t know, but this is to let people know that we stand with those people who are disenfranchised.”

Originally from the east coast, Morrison retired to Northwest Arkansas about three years ago after working for the federal government for 25 years. Having worked in the federal courts, he witnessed the deportation of undocumented immigrants, which left him conflicted. 
“I’m one of those individuals who feel that you obey our laws, but just the same, we have laws that you have to abide by, and this deportation without due process is, I’ll call it shameful but I’m being very nice when I say it that way,” he said. “We, as a country, we need to treat people better.”
Though the protest was staged outside of the El Salvador Consulate, Childs noted participants weren’t protesting the consulate, which does “really important work” for immigrants. Instead, the event was “about pressuring our government to do better.”
Childs said she hasn’t been personally affected by the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration, but she has seen the toll it can take on fellow Arkansans. Over the weekend, Childs said Indivisible NWA members listened to a presentation from Arkansas United, an immigrant advocacy group, about ways citizens can be supportive of immigrants. Prior to the presentation’s start, Childs said AU Executive Director Mireya Reith received a call related to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement incident.
“So it’s neighbors, but you don’t have to experience it for your heart to hurt,” Childs said. 
Reith told the Advocate Thursday that initial contact with ICE in Arkansas generally has been tied to some kind of warrant. But they’ve also seen collateral arrests of individuals who weren’t the initial target consistently since January, she said.

There is a bipartisan effort in Congress […],"U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, attended the Republican 4th Congressional District convention in Carroll on April 23, 2022. (Photo by Jared Strong/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Members of Iowa’s all-Republican federal delegation say they were supportive of releasing information related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein — but said the push in Congress to compel the U.S. Department of Justice to publicize files and surrounding uproar was being used for political gain by Democrats.
There is a bipartisan effort in Congress calling for the release of government investigative documents on Epstein, the Florida financier whose 2019 death in his New York City jail cell was ruled a suicide by authorities as he awaited federal sex trafficking charges.
Trump had committed on the 2024 presidential campaign trail to declassifying documents related to Epstein if elected for a second term. But some of his supporters, as well as Democrats, were critical of the lack of new information in the U.S. Department of Justice’s February release on Epstein. Backlash reached a high after the DOJ published a memo July 7 denying the existence of a “client list,” confirmation that Epstein committed suicide, and statement that the Justice Department would not publish further files.
Though Trump later ordered the DOJ to release grand jury testimony in the case, the response prompted a bipartisan push in Congress to compel the public release of more information.
The House Rules Committee, led by Republicans, recessed Monday before Democrats could force votes on amendments related to Epstein files to legislation being discussed. U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky, working with Rep. Ro Khanna, D-California, has also discussed plans to use a discharge petition — a procedural move — to force the House to vote on releasing the “Epstein files.”
House Speaker Mike Johnson and other House Republican leaders have said congressional action is not necessary, as the Trump administration is already “in the process” of releasing Epstein-related materials and needs “space” to do this work. Johnson announced Tuesday House members would go home earlier than expected for their recess until September to avoid “political games” related to Epstein.
Tumult over Epstein files dogs Trump in both DC and Florida

This is a position supported by members of Iowa’s delegation, who said they believe the Trump administration is working to make more information on the case public.
In a weekly press call earlier in July, U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson said she thought Massie “is approaching this in the wrong way, and he’s doing it in a way that we give the floor to Democrats, which is not how we should be doing business,” the Gazette reported.
““I do trust President Trump here and (Attorney General) Pam Bondi to do the right thing, and (FBI Director) Kash Patel to do the right thing at the FBI,” she said.
A spokesperson for Hinson said in a statement Thursday that the Iowa congresswoman believes Epstein was a pedophile and that she supports Americans who have questions and demand justice for her actions, while also trusting “this administration’s continued commitment to the truth and transparency.”
U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks also stated she supports the Trump administration in efforts to publicize information on the case.
“We deserve transparency and honesty from our government,” Miller-Meeks said in a statement Thursday. “For four years, Joe Biden and Democrats ignored the opportunity to deliver truth. I stand with President Trump in his efforts to ensure transparency into Jeffrey Epstein’s heinous crimes while protecting the victims who endured so much abuse.”
In the Senate, U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley said on a weekly press call Wednesday he believes the Trump administration seeking the release of grand jury testimony was a “step in the right direction.” He said he has been asking for information related to Epstein for more than five years, and that he hopes to get “follow ups on the things that I have asked for.”
“I’ve consistently called for transparency surrounding the Department of Justice investigation into Jeffrey Epstein,” Grassley said. “I think true accountability, especially for people that have been victimized by the Epstein episode, requires full transparency. People have a right to know the details behind this investigation, and I know that Bondi and Patel are working together to answer questions about this investigation … and I hope that results in bringing perpetrators to justice.”
CNN reported that Grassley said he does not plan to investigate the Epstein case as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, but that he expects the issue will come up when Bondi testifies before the committee at an upcoming oversight hearing.
As the committee met Thursday, Democrats accused Republicans on the committee of “concealing the Epstein files” after they did not support an amendment related to releasing Epstein case material proposed for an opioid data collection bill.
Democrats have heavily criticized Republicans in Congress for not taking further action on releasing documents, highlighting the Wednesday Wall Street Journal report that Bondi had told Trump his name appeared multiple times in DOJ documents related to Epstein.
“As new reporting reveals that Donald Trump’s name is in the Epstein files ‘multiple times,’ House Republicans are fleeing Washington as fast as they can, capping off a devastating legislative session where they made the largest cuts to health care and food assistance in American history, took an axe to construction jobs, raised energy prices, and put thousands of nursing homes at risk of closure,” Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee, said in a Thursday statement. “When they return to their districts, House Republicans should prepare for a rude awakening after putting billionaires and an infamous sex-trafficker before the hardworking Americans that elected them.”
Some Democratic challengers to Iowa’s GOP lawmakers have also highlighted their incumbent opponent’s approach to Epstein in campaign materials. Clint Twedt-Ball, a Democrat who announced his campaign for Iowa’s 2nd District Tuesday, listed Hinson’s lack of action on releasing Epstein documents in a news release Thursday.
“Hinson has reversed course on all of her campaign promises: to lower costs for working families, to protect Medicaid and Social Security for our seniors, and to release the Epstein files,” Twedt-Ball said. “The idea that Hinson would fly home to Iowa without even attempting to find solutions to these problems is a slap in the face to every voter that trusted her.”
Many Republicans, including members of Iowa’s federal delegation, have decried Democrats’ focus on the Epstein issue, saying that they are using the financier’s sex crimes and victims for political purposes.
“Transparency and accountability from our government isn’t optional, it’s a duty,” U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn said in a statement. “Jeffrey Epstein is a disgusting human being who committed horrific crimes. Victims deserve justice, not DC politicians who want to use them to score political points.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Members of the Oklahoma State Board of Education on Thursday said they want to hold a special meeting to discuss how their authority aligns with the state’s superintendent. 
The board members, who govern Oklahoma’s public schools, said they wanted to meet to discuss the extent of state Superintendent Ryan Walters’ power and what actions he can take without their authority after learning Thursday morning that the body’s secretary was no longer employed by the state Department of Education.
Member Chris Van Denhende asked to call a special meeting, which he said is allowed by statute if a majority of the members agrees, to discuss the “appropriate roles of the board compared to the president of the board.” Walters is president of the board. 
He pointed to statute that grants the board the power to “appoint, prescribe the duties, and fix the compensation of a secretary, an attorney, and all other personnel necessary,” but said the state Department of Education had removed the board secretary without notifying or discussing the matter with the body first.
Chad Kutmas, legal counsel for the board, shut down the request, saying they couldn’t vote to hold a special meeting because it wasn’t on Thursday’s agenda. State law requires agendas to be posted at least 24 hours before the meeting, and public boards cannot take action on items not on the agenda.
Kutmas said board members would have to communicate with him after the meeting over email to call for a special meeting. 
“It would be a request that wouldn’t be made in the public and it certainly wouldn’t be done in a way that would be a quorum of people seeking a special meeting,” he said.

Ryan Deatherage, another board member, said he was cautious about taking the conversation outside the meeting. 
“I would just be cautious, because I know we’ve asked things like this in the past, and we’ve kind of got pushed down a rabbit trail,” he said. “So if you’re committing to having those conversations with us and actually being productive in that, rather than stating some other reason not to be able to do that, I’m totally in favor of that.”
Walters said he will evaluate a request for a special meeting when the board provides it to him in writing or calls him about it. 
Board members also asked to add an agenda item to next month’s meeting to discuss, and potentially vote, on enacting a rule allowing board members to add items to meeting agendas. As board chair, Walters determines what items appear on the agenda. 
Walters said he does not think the board should have the authority to put items on the agenda. 
“Look, they can submit whatever request for me that they want,” he said. “We’ve put items on the agenda that they’ve asked for. We’ve produced documents for them. So look, we’ll take it on a case by case basis, I’m happy to look at what they have to offer. But again, my bigger concern is the board being out of step with Oklahomans. My bigger concern is the direction that they’re going and wanting to protect an education system that’s failed.” 
He said he will evaluate a request for a special meeting when the board provides it to him in writing or calls him about it. 
The board’s request for the special meeting followed questions over his authority to mandate free school lunches, a special, controversial test for California and New York teachers moving to Oklahoma, and a partnership with American Virtual School, a private and online Arizona-based institution. The board questioned why they weren’t consulted. 
The board and state Legislature have both made efforts to give members the ability to add items to meeting agendas, but all efforts have been unsuccessful.
House Bill 1491 from Rep. Ronny Johns, R-Ada, would have allowed two members on the state board or any local school board with five or more positions to place an item on an upcoming meeting agenda with a written request. 
Gov. Kevin Stitt and top Republican leaders in the House and Senate endorsed the measure, and it passed a vote by the full House with overwhelming bipartisan support but was not heard in the Senate.

Despite the Trump administration’s public pronouncements that it has hired enough wildland firefighters, documents obtained by ProPublica show a high vacancy rate, as well as internal concern among top officials as more than 1 million acres burn across 10 states.
Less than a month ago, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced that the Trump administration had done a historically good job preparing the nation for the summer fire season. “We are on track to meet and potentially exceed our firefighting hiring goals,” said Rollins, during an address to Western governors. Rollins oversees the wildland firefighting workforce at the U.S. Forest Service, a subagency of the Department of Agriculture. Rollins had noted in her remarks that the administration had exempted firefighters from a federal hiring freeze, and she claimed that the administration was outdoing its predecessor: “We have reached 96% of our hiring goal, far outpacing the rate of hiring and onboarding over the past three years and in the previous administration.”
Since then, the Forest Service’s assertions have gotten even more optimistic: The agency now claims it has reached 99% of its firefighting hiring goal.
But according to internal data obtained by ProPublica, Rollins’ characterization is dangerously misleading. She omitted a wave of resignations from the agency this spring and that many senior management positions remain vacant. Layoffs by the Department of Government Efficiency, voluntary deferred resignations and early retirements have severely hampered the wildland firefighting force. According to the internal national data, which has not been previously reported, more than 4,500 Forest Service firefighting jobs — as many as 27% — remained vacant as of July 17. A Forest Service employee who is familiar with the data said it comes from administrators who input staffing information into a computer tool used to create organization charts. The employee said that while the data could contain inaccuracies in certain forests, it broadly reflects the agency’s desired staffing levels. The employee said the data showing “active” unfilled positions was “current and up-to-date for last week.”
The Department of Agriculture disputes that assessment, but the figures are supported by anecdotal accounts from wildland firefighters in New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, California and Wyoming. According to a recent survey by Forest Service fire managers in California, 26% of engine captain positions and 42% of engineer positions were vacant. A veteran Forest Service firefighter in California characterized the Trump administration’s current estimate of the size of its firefighting workforce as “grossly inaccurate.”
Last week, Tom Schultz, the chief of the Forest Service, circulated a letter to high-ranking officials in the agency that underscored the dire moment. “As expected, the 2025 Fire Year is proving to be extremely challenging,” wrote Schultz in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by ProPublica. “We know the demand for resources outpaces their availability.” Schultz at once directed staff to employ full suppression — stomping out fires as quickly as possible, instead of letting them burn for the sake of landscape management — and acknowledged that the resources necessary to pursue such an aggressive strategy were lacking. All options were on the table, he wrote, including directing human-resources employees to fight fires and asking recently departed employees with firefighting qualifications to return to work.
When asked about the discrepancy between Schultz’s memo and Rollins’ public statements on firefighting staffing at the Forest Service, an agency spokesperson said that Schultz was referring to employees who can be called on to bolster the agency’s response “as fire activity increases,” while Rollins was pointing only to full-time firefighters. “The Forest Service remains fully equipped and operationally ready to protect people and communities from wildfire,” the spokesperson said, noting that “many individuals that have separated from the Agency either through retirements or voluntary resignations still possess active wildland fire qualifications and are making themselves available to support fire response operations.”
The federal government employs thousands of wildland firefighters, but the precise number is opaque. Throughout the Department of the Interior, which is overseen by Secretary Doug Burgum, there are about 5,800 wildland firefighters in four agencies that have been impacted by cuts. An employee at a national park in Colorado that is threatened by wildfire said that they were “severely understaffed during the Biden administration on most fronts, and now it’s so much worse than it’s ever been.”
But the Forest Service is by far the largest employer of wildland firefighters, and it has long used gymnastic arithmetic to paint an optimistic picture of its staffing. Last summer, ProPublica reported that the Forest Service under President Joe Biden had overstated its capacity. Robert Kuhn, a former Forest Service official who between 2009 and 2011 co-authored an assessment of the agency’s personnel needs, recently said that the practice of selectively counting firefighters dates back years. “What the public needs to understand is, that is just a very small number of what is needed every summer,” he said. Riva Duncan, a retired Forest Service fire chief and the vice president of Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, a labor advocacy organization, said staffing is a constant frustration for managers on the ground. “We have engines that are completely unstaffed,” said Duncan, who remains active in wildland firefighting, having worked in temporary roles this summer. “We have vacant positions in management.”
That said, there is a difference this fire season from years past. Officials in the previous administration publicly acknowledged the danger presented by an exodus of experienced wildland firefighters. The Trump administration has taken a different approach — claiming to have solved the problem while simultaneously exacerbating it. When asked about the staffing cuts, Anna Kelly, a White House deputy press secretary, wrote, “President Trump is proud of all Secretary Rollins has accomplished to improve forest management, including by ending the 2001 Roadless Rule for stronger fire prevention, and Secretary Burgum’s great work protecting our nation’s treasured public lands.”
In March, Congress finally codified a permanent raise for federal wildland firefighters via the appropriations process, a change that advocates have sought for years. In her remarks in June, Rollins credited the president: “Out of gratitude for the selfless service of our Forest Service firefighters, President Trump permanently increased the pay for our federal wildland firefighters.”
But in February, the Trump administration laid off about 700 employees who support wildland fire operations, from human-resource managers to ecologists and trail-crew workers. Those employees possess what are known as red cards — certifications that allow them to work on fire crews. Many were subsequently rehired, but the administration then pushed Forest Service employees to accept deferred resignations and early retirements.
Last month, President Donald Trump issued an executive order directing the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior to combine their firefighting forces. For the moment, it’s unknown what form that restructuring will take, but many Forest Service firefighters are anticipating further staffing cuts. A spokesperson for the Department of the Interior wrote, “We are taking steps to unify federal wildfire programs to streamline bureaucracy.”
Administration officials have maintained that employees primarily assigned to wildland fire were exempted from the resignation offers this spring. But according to another internal data set obtained by ProPublica, of the more than 4,000 Forest Service employees who accepted deferred resignations and early retirements, approximately 1,600 had red cards. (A spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture wrote that the actual number was 1,400, adding that 85 of them “have decided to return for the season.”)
Even those figures don’t account for all the lost institutional knowledge. The departures included meteorologists who provided long-range forecasts, allowing fire managers to decide where to deploy crews. One of the meteorologists who left was Charles Maxwell, who had for more than 20 years interpreted weather models predicting summer monsoons at the Southwest Coordination Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, an interagency office. The thunderstorms can fuel wildfire, with lightning and wind, and extinguish them, with great rains. Lately, according to Maxwell, the monsoons have become less and less reliable, and understanding their nuances can be challenging. Maxwell said that he’d already been planning to retire next year. But he also said he “was concerned with the degree of chaos, the potential degradation of services and what would happen to my job.”
Maxwell noted that his work had been covered by knowledgeable fill-ins from out of state. But another firefighter who worked on blazes in New Mexico said that Maxwell’s understanding of the monsoon had been missed. A spokesperson for the Department of the Interior, which oversees the interagency office where Maxwell worked, wrote, “We do not comment on personnel matters.”
The monsoon season is now here and has brought deadly flash flooding along old burn scars in Ruidoso, New Mexico, while distributing sporadic rain in the state’s Gila National Forest.
It is shaping up to be a severe fire season. On Monday, federal firefighters reported 86 new fires across the West; by Tuesday, there were 105 more. And there’s already been some criticism of the federal response. Arizona’s governor and members of Congress have called for an investigation into the Park Service’s handling of a blaze this month that leveled a historic lodge on the Grand Canyon’s North Rim. Last month, Rollins acknowledged, “Fires don’t know Republican or Democrat, or which side of the aisle you are on.” This much, at least, is true.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)A Sioux Falls jury ordered a former state prison warden to pay $105,000 in damages to an inmate after a federal civil rights trial, but it’s unclear if the warden or state will pay the award.
Mark Christians, 45, sued a series of Department of Corrections employees in 2020, alleging that inadequate nutrition caused him to lose 90 pounds between 2017 and 2018 at Mike Durfee State Prison in Springfield. He also alleged that prison food had made him ill and left him with permanent health conditions.
In 2022, he amended his lawsuit to include allegations of cruel and unusual punishment during a 2021 stay in disciplinary housing at the South Dakota State Penitentiary in Sioux Falls. 
Christians lost weight during that two-month period, as well. He’d been sent to the penitentiary’s Special Housing Unit for fighting with another inmate, court documents say. But he alleged he was held there longer than intended because he’d gone on hunger strike to protest over his meals. He’d lost weight during his first 11 days in confinement, his lawsuit said.
State to pay inmate in federal excessive force lawsuit

U.S. District Judge Lawrence Piersol dismissed many of Christians’ claims and released multiple defendants from liability in the years after the inmate filed his lawsuits. Christians represented himself for most of those years.
Piersol appointed Christians two lawyers this spring to handle the trial — stretched across four days this month in Sioux Falls, with a break for the weekend — on his claims about inadequate nutrition and punishment claims.
The remaining defendants included Brent Fluke, the former warden at the Springfield prison, and Darin Young, the former penitentiary warden.
Jurors were instructed, according to court documents, that the U.S. Constitution’s Eighth Amendment “requires prison officials to provide prisoners with humane conditions of confinement, including nutritionally adequate meals to maintain health.” The Eighth Amendment bars cruel and unusual punishment.
Another jury instruction asked the panel to decide if Christians’ meals were “nutritionally inadequate,” if the defendants knew he’d likely be harmed as a result, that they showed “deliberate indifference” to that harm, and that Christians actually experienced that harm.
Jurors answered “yes” to each of those questions for both Fluke and Young. Fluke was ordered to pay $1 in “nominal” damages, meaning those directly related to Christians’ claims about his nutrition in Springfield. Fluke was not ordered to pay punitive damages, which are levied as a punishment. 
Young was ordered to pay $5,000 in nominal damages and $100,000 in punitive damages.
None of the other defendants were found liable for Christians’ weight loss.
Unclear who might pay damages
The former state employees were represented by lawyers from Attorney General Marty Jackley’s office. 
A spokesman for that office said the decision on whether to appeal or otherwise challenge the validity of the verdict lies with the Department of Corrections. That department’s spokesman, meanwhile, said it cannot comment on ongoing litigation.
Tyler Haigh of Sioux Falls, one of two lawyers who represented Christians, also declined to comment, citing the ongoing legal case.
Neither Haigh, nor lawyers for the state, have commented on who might ultimately be responsible to pay damages to Christians if the verdict stands.
South Dakota has an insurance pool called the Public Entity Pool for Liability that covers certain expenses related to lawsuits involving current or former employees. Under South Dakota law, though, that fund cannot be used to pay punitive damages in civil court cases.
The state also has an Extraordinary Litigation Fund, designed to cover “plaintiff attorney fee awards, retention of outside counsel, settlement costs, or other litigation expenses not otherwise eligible to be paid” by the pool.
Both funds are managed by the Bureau of Administration, whose commissioner, Darin Seeley, did not respond to a request for comment.

While Stamford still has fewer residents than Bridgeport, it is now the second largest city in the state and is growing at a faster pace than Bridgeport, according to Census data.
In 2020, Bridgeport’s population was 148,654 while Stamford was 135,470 — a difference of just over 13,000 people. 
If current trends hold, Stamford could surpass Bridgeport within the next decade, like it did to New Haven and Hartford in 2020. In that census, it jumped over Hartford, which lost population and counted 121,054 residents within its city limits, and inched past New Haven’s 134,023 population to take the title of second largest Connecticut city. 
Between 2010 and 2020, Stamford’s population jumped by 10.5%, compared to a 3.1% increase in Bridgeport. 
Stamford’s growth has been driven, in part, by a housing development boom, investment in its downtown and its proximity to New York City.

(MPAN)A Christian legal organization will now have a seat on the council overseeing the state’s criminal justice system, after Gov. Greg Gianforte appointed Alliance Defending Freedom’s Jessica Flint to the state’s Criminal Justice Oversight Council.
The Montana Legislature created the 16-member council in 2017, comprising four legislators and 14 appointed members representing various parts of the criminal justice system. Flint’s position is as the “representative of civil rights advocates” and was created to advocate for the civil rights of incarcerated people.
Flint is a State Government Relations Manager for the legal organization Alliance Defending Freedom, which, its website states, was founded “with the goal of keeping the doors open for the Gospel.” 
Flint briefly introduced herself and ADF’s work during a July 23 meeting of the council.
“We are a nonprofit legal advocacy organization working primarily on free speech and free exercise of religion, and the reason you do that is because we’ve seen laws that criminalize and punish people,” Flint said. “So we work to make sure that this doesn’t become a basis for criminalizing people utilizing their constitutional right.”
Flint referenced a case ADF had been involved in, when a Colorado baker in 2012 refused to provide a wedding cake for a same-sex wedding. In the ensuing legal battle, Jack Phillips of Masterpiece Cakeshop was initially found in violation of the state’s Anti-Discrimination Act and told to start making cakes for same-sex couples if they asked, and provide two years of reporting every time they denied someone service. 
The case ended with the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in favor of Phillips, who was represented by the ADF.
The jail time Flint mentioned was held out as a possibility when the Colorado Human Rights Commission first handled the case in 2013. However, Phillips never served jail time and the possibility was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court which said the commission had acted with prejudice.
In the 2018 Supreme Court opinion on the case, it states, “Colorado law does not permit the (Colorado Civil Rights Commission) to assess money damages or fines.”
The Alliance Defending Freedom and the Governor’s Office did not respond to a request for comment by Thursday afternoon. The Governor’s Office was provided with seven questions, which mostly regarded Flint’s background, the role the ADF is to play in state policy and why a Christian organization is now on the council. The ADF was asked for a general comment on Flint’s appointment.
Flint’s seat had solely been held by members of the American Civil Liberties Union prior to her appointment. The ACLU has significant programming around civil rights issues incarcerated people face.
In a comment to the Daily Montanan, civil rights organization Western States Center expressed concern with the move.
“It’s certainly concerning to see the Montana governor replacing an ACLU representative on the state Criminal Justice Oversight Commission with a member of the Alliance Defending Freedom, a powerful anti-LGBTQ law firm that’s behind the majority of anti-transgender bills targeting youth, athletes, and access to restrooms,” Western States Center senior organizer Kate Bitz said. “Nothing about ADF represents expertise in criminal justice reform, and it is bizarre to replace a seat held by the nation’s leading civil rights group with a deep-pocketed SPLC-designated hate group that works to limit the civil rights of Americans under the false guise of ‘religious freedom.’”
Henry Seaton, with ACLU-Montana, held the position prior to Flint, and told the Daily Montanan he found out he wasn’t being reappointed via a short email from Lieutenant Governor Kristen Juras on July 18.
He said the council is meant to bring stakeholders to the table, “regardless of political leaning or background” and to discuss those. ACLU-Montana also provides data to the council, which Seaton said was “robust.”
“I think the ACLU, since its founding in Montana, has had decades of experience advocating for civil rights for people interacting with our justice system, whether it’s to try and reduce and end mass incarceration or ensuring free speech rights for people who are incarcerated, basically anything guaranteed under the Constitution,” Seaton said. “The ACLU has a robust history in advocating for both from a policy standpoint and from a legal standpoint.”
Seaton also said the appointment makes the justice oversight council “unnecessarily politicized.” 
Seaton provided examples of the work he did in his capacity on the council, including recent work with county attorneys on possibly expanding a work-time credit program for people who are on probation or parole.
“Our worry is that civil rights will not be as effectively advocated for without someone who does not have that same wealth of knowledge and experience as the ACLU of Montana does,” Seaton said.
Flint, according to her LinkedIn page, was a licensed relator in Billings between 2017-’22 and joined the Office of Public Instruction in 2020, where she stayed for about two years. She then joined the ADF in 2022.
Jessica Flint is married to Aaron Flint, a conservative radio talk radio host who often has Montana’s Republican powerbrokers on his show. Campaign finance records show Jessica Flint has given political donations to Gov. Gianforte and current Attorney General Austin Knudsen. The Gianforte Family Foundation has also partnered with Aaron Flint and KBUL Radio in the past.
Aaron Flint did not respond to a comment request regarding his wife’s appointment and the number of times the Governor has appeared on his show during the past year.

Young said that when Medicaid cuts hit Colorado in the past, the state could no longer provide residential care for his sister. She went through 20 different residential facilities in a span of 18 months, all of which were “inadequate” because they did not have proper funding, he said. 
“Often, she was ejected from a placement because she overwhelmed the providers, sometimes without even a phone call,” Young said.

Young and financial officials from four other Democratic-led states participated in a call hosted by Americans for Responsible Growth, a national advocacy group that works with state financial leaders. They warned about how Republicans’ recent policy law, called by President Donald Trump the “big, beautiful bill,” will negatively affect Medicaid and Medicare recipients ahead of the 60th anniversary of the programs.
The law cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, a state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes.
Dave Wallack, executive director of Americans for Responsible Growth, said that since the Trump administration took office, Republicans have “systematically gutted health care programs, fired thousands of federal workers, and slashed more than a trillion dollars for Medicaid, the largest cut in the program’s history.” 
Wallack said the cuts will lead to 17 million Americans losing health care coverage and more than 50,000 preventable deaths annually. Young said in Colorado, more than 375,000 recipients could lose Medicaid coverage. Democratic officials from New Mexico, Illinois, Minnesota and Maryland all said that rural communities in their states will be hit hardest by the cuts, and they will feel the effects first. 
Rural hospitals at risk
Laura Montoya, the New Mexico state treasurer, said her state is the No. 1 recipient state for Medicaid in the nation, and 80% of the babies born in New Mexico are born into Medicaid. She said the federal law’s changes to Medicaid will “force hospitals and clinics to either raise premiums or copays or shut down entirely,” and 15 hospitals in rural communities are already at risk of closing their doors. 
“Our state’s entire provider network depends on the state’s current Medicaid coverage landscape,” Montoya said. “These cuts will increase health care costs for all New Mexicans regardless of Medicaid enrollment, not to mention more uninsured individuals could end up skipping preventative care leading to worsened health outcomes, higher cost for emergency care, and more crowded emergency rooms and urgent care facilities, placing even more strain on an already overwhelmed system.”
The shift of responsibility for states to fund Medicaid could also destabilize New Mexico’s entire support network, including housing assistance, early childhood education, public safety and economic development, Montoya said. The New Mexico Legislature passed a measure creating a Medicaid trust fund to safeguard services amid federal cuts, she added. 
Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs said 44% of the Medicaid recipients in his state are children, 9% are seniors, and 7% are adults with disabilities. Nine rural hospitals in Illinois, all in Republican districts, are at risk of closing because of funding cuts, he said. 
“When hospitals close and health care providers cut back, people lose their jobs. They lose their income, and their health insurance,” Frerichs said. “Illinois’ economy will be destabilized. The cruel, inhumane Trump big bad budget bill will wreak havoc across Illinois for years to come.”
Julie Blaha, Minnesota’s state auditor, said about 25% of Minnesotans are enrolled in the state’s Medicaid program, which also supports 30% of births. For Black and Indigenous communities, those numbers are even higher: The state’s medical assistance program covers 80% of Black babies born in the state and 90% of Indigenous babies. 
Blaha said it is more cost-efficient to keep people on these health care programs in a stable place, as it’s more expensive “to pull somebody up who’s fallen through.”  
“It is time to stand up and tell Congress and tell Trump to roll back these terrible cuts and try to stop the avalanche before it crushes us all,” Blaha said. 
Brooke Lierman, the Maryland state comptroller, said 42% of her state’s population is supported by Medicaid or Medicare. She said the two programs were designed to take care of “vulnerable Americans” who would be “sicker and worse off” without the coverage they provide. 
“These programs are economic powerhouses that drive prosperity in our communities and strengthen our state’s fiscal foundation,” Lierman said. “Cutting Medicaid is both fiscally reckless and morally bankrupt, abandoning our most vulnerable residents, including our seniors and people with disabilities, while destroying the economic foundation that so many of our communities depend on.” 
‘Among the greatest policy achievements’
Health care is a “major economic driver” in Colorado, Young said, as hospitals employ about 1 in 5 Colorado residents and generate $1 billion in tax revenue yearly. Reduced federal investment in health care will lead to clinic closures and reduced tax revenue that will affect quality of life for “Coloradans of every age and income bracket,” he said.
“Colorado cannot afford to downsize our health care sector,” Young said. “We’re already facing dire workforce and health care shortages, especially in rural and frontier communities. The state can’t make up for these losses either.”
Medicaid and Medicare are “among the greatest policy achievements in American history,” Young said, as the programs strengthen health care systems and lift people out of poverty. He said the programs can be strengthened while saving money, but “this slash and burn technique” will be “devastating.”  
“When people get the care they need, they hold down jobs, they provide for their families and avoid catastrophic medical debt,” Young said.

Kelly Armstrong. (Photo provided by Office of the Governor)The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to prolong a temporary freeze on North Dakota’s legislative district map — hinting that the justices may be interested in hearing a tribal voting rights case against the state.
The Supreme Court’s order, issued Thursday, prevents an appellate court’s judgment in a landmark North Dakota redistricting lawsuit from taking effect until the higher court makes a final decision in the case. The suit, filed in 2022 by the Spirit Lake Nation, Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and three tribal citizens, accuses a legislative district map adopted by North Dakota lawmakers in 2021 of unlawfully diluting the power of Native American voters.
The judgment would do two things: make it so that private citizens in the 8th Circuit can’t sue under a law that bans racially discriminatory voting practices, and pave the way for North Dakota’s district lines to revert back to the 2021 map. 
Now that the Supreme Court has stepped in, voters in the seven 8th Circuit states will still be able to bring lawsuits under the statute, known as Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, at least until it decides the North Dakota case.
“For decades, Tribes and Native Americans in North Dakota have fought for the rights of reservation voters,” Lenny Powell, a Native American Rights Fund attorney representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement Thursday. “Today is another victory in that fight.”
The order also likely means North Dakota’s district lines will remain the same for the 2026 election cycle. The current map — which puts the Turtle Mountain and Spirit Lake reservations in the same district — was adopted in 2024 after the tribes convinced U.S. District Court Judge Peter Welte that the 2021 map was discriminatory.
The plaintiffs asked the U.S. Supreme Court to freeze the current map in place as they prepare to appeal the 8th Circuit’s decision to the high court. Thursday’s order solidifies a shorter stay on the judgment the Supreme Court issued last week.
North Dakota seeks to use former legislative map while voting rights case proceeds

“We are relieved that Native voters in North Dakota retain the ability to protect ourselves from discrimination at the polls,” said Jamie Azure, chairman of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa. “Our fight for the rights of our citizens continues.” 
Had the Supreme Court allowed the 8th Circuit to proceed with its judgment, three North Dakota lawmakers would change districts: Rep. Collete Brown, D-Warwick, would go from representing District 9 to District 15. Rep. Donna Henderson, R-Calvin, would switch from District 15 to District 9B, while Sen. Kent Weston, R-Sarles, would switch from District 15 to District 9. All three are up for election next year.
Brown is also one of the three tribal citizens who are plaintiffs in the case.
Since the North Dakota constitution requires lawmakers to live in the same district they represent, the judgment could potentially lead to those three lawmakers being unseated, attorneys for the state’s legislative branch have said.
“Today’s ruling helps protect our voice while we continue the fight for Native voting rights and fair representation,” Brown said in a statement on Thursday’s decision.
In court documents arguing against the stay, attorneys representing the state argued the Legislature’s attorneys did not offer convincing evidence the three lawmakers would actually be at risk of losing their seats if the judgment took effect. 
Anna Baldwin, a Campaign Legal Center attorney representing the plaintiffs, said that Thursday’s order is “both a strong signal that the court will hear the case and that it is seriously considering reversing the 8th Circuit’s decision.”
The 8th Circuit had found that the Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act — which private plaintiffs had used to bring voting discrimination claims against state governments for decades — may only be enforced by the U.S. Department of Justice. The 8th Circuit is the only one in the country to make this finding.
The plaintiffs say the appellate court misinterpreted the law, and that their findings threaten to take away an important way for citizens to protect their rights.
“We view this as the first step of the Supreme Court correcting the really grievous error that the 8th Circuit made here,” Baldwin said.
If the Supreme Court does take the case, oral arguments would likely take place sometime next year, they added.
Tribal voting rights victory shuffles legislative seats

North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley in a Thursday presentation to Bismarck and Mandan’s bar association also said he thinks there is a “very real chance” the U.S. Supreme Court will agree to review the case. He said he believes the lawsuit will ultimately come out in North Dakota’s favor.
Attorneys for North Dakota earlier this week said that the court should honor the 8th Circuit’s decision. In a Tuesday filing, they said private plaintiffs should not be able to use lawsuits to upend the redistricting process.
The tribes have until early October to file their formal petition asking the Supreme Court to hear the lawsuit.
If the court denies their petition before the end of the year — thereby affirming the 8th Circuit’s ruling — North Dakota could end up with the 2021 district map for the 2026 election. That’s because the state has until Dec. 31 to finalize its district lines for the upcoming election cycle.
The order indicates that Chief Justice John Roberts and justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Ketanji Brown Jackson, Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh voted in favor of the stay.
It says justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch would have denied the tribes’ request.
The 8th Circuit includes North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri and Arkansas.

The fire started when the property owner was burning brush. On Thursday, 35 state firefighters are on site, working alongside crews from a handful of municipalities and the U.S. Forest Service.

Pilot Dan Brown was flying over Fair Haven on Tuesday night when he spotted smokestacks bulloughing up from the woods around sunset. He alerted firefighters, and since then, they’ve been battling a blaze spread across 11 acres of forested private property. 
The fire first started when the property owner was burning brush to clear shooting lanes for hunting, said James Heller, Fair Haven’s Fire Chief. The property owner didn’t realize that he failed to put out the fire, he said. 
With pretty dry conditions, the fire grew in a remote part of the woods where people didn’t take notice. 
That is, until Brown was flying a private plane overhead before sunset. Struck by the quantity of smoke coming from the woods, he alerted the Fire Department in Castleton and sent over pictures of what he saw. 
Two days later, on Thursday afternoon, 35 state firefighters were on site, working alongside crews from Castleton, Rutland City, Poultney and Whitehall with help from the U.S. Forest Service, Heller said.

The groups are trying to maintain a perimeter to contain the blaze. The fire is largely burning underground and is very far from any structures, Heller said. 
“They’re attempting to establish a water supply and get a hose line up to their fire line,” Heller said. 
Without road access to the area, crews have only been able to get to the fire on 4-wheelers. From above, state hazmat teams used drones and infrared mapping to pinpoint fire hot spots, and follow its movement. 
Crews of fire fighters have been cycling in and out to bring in “fresh troops,” Heller said. They thought they had the fire contained within 10 acres until a breeze on Wednesday morning spread flames further. Now, it’s looking like winds will push the fire to the north or northeast, Heller said. 
The blaze is what’s called a duff fire, which eats through plant material like leaves and bark that are compacted under the forest floor. 
“The only thing that’s gonna ultimately quench it is gonna be a good rain,” Heller said. 
It’s important for people to keep an eye on daily fire danger reports from the state because “while it may look green, it can be sneakily dry in the understory,” said Megan Davin, a spokesperson for the state’s Wildland Fire Team, which is fighting the fire. 
Fair Haven has been considered high risk for fires throughout most of the summer, Davin said. A strip of the state, including Fair Haven, keeps getting missed by rain while other parts of the state get hit, leading to unusually dry conditions. 
On Tuesday evening, when they heard from Brown, the pilot, firefighters in Castleton reached out to those in Fair Haven, who fought the fire for more than four hours on Tuesday night with crews from two other towns. 
When the fire spread beyond containment on Wednesday, crews from five different municipalities worked on-site for nine hours. And a number of statewide emergency response groups have chipped in resources, along with the U.S. Forest Service. 
With hot temperatures on Thursday, those fighting the fire are trying to stay cool, Heller said. He’s thankful for all of the resources they’ve gotten from around and beyond the state, he said. 
Tomorrow, they hope for rain. 
“Anything we get is gonna be a blessing,” Heller said.

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)FARGO — An annual industry tour of the wheat crop in North Dakota and northwest Minnesota projects lower yields than a year ago but an overall good quality crop. 
The Wheat Quality Council tour projects an average yield of 49 bushels per acre, down from 54.5 bushels in 2024. The durum wheat forecast also was down at 37 bushels per acre, compared to 45.3 in 2024.

Dave Green, one of the tour organizers for the Wheat Quality Council, said the yield projections did not quite live up to his expectations.
 “I thought it looked a little better than that,” he said during a debriefing at North Dakota State University for participants in the three-day tour. 
He said fields in the northern tier of counties along the Canadian border showed some signs of lack of moisture but the crop otherwise looks good. 
Nick Sinner, who was appointed executive director of the North Dakota Grain Growers Association in the spring, attended the tour wrapup.
“It’s not a bin-buster but a good solid crop,” Sinner said. He was not a part of the tour but said he had driven across much of the state this week and said he was impressed by the evenness of the crop. He said he was surprised to hear the slightly lower yield expectations.

Sinner said he went through areas of Barnes and Cass counties hit hard by recent storms. He said the wheat seems to have held up well but some soybean fields were devastated. 
The tour attracts people from across the milling and baking industries who learn how to calculate yields before criss-crossing North Dakota and the western edge of Minnesota, inspecting fields as they go. 
Tour participants from across the U.S. also learn about crop production, life in North Dakota and get a chance to visit the North Dakota State Mill and Elevator in Grand Forks, the largest flour mill in the country. 
North Dakota is the nation’s largest producer of spring wheat. 
Green said the tour often offers a chance for participants to see examples of diseases and pests that can damage the wheat crop but there was little to find this year. 
He said wheat harvest is a couple of weeks away in the Red River Valley with the rest of North Dakota still three to five weeks away.

Clerks are concerned an upcoming audit, part of the Legislature’s look into the state court system and its caseload, will disclose to state auditors information that is either under court seal or confidential data ranging from medical records to criminal investigations..
The heart of the issue is two-fold: Which entity controls the system and which is in charge of maintaining the records.
In a letter sent on Monday by Dave McAlpin, administrator for the state courts, he outlined his office’s understanding of state law and the audit. Clerks are elected at the county level and answer to the voters, while McAlpin’s position is appointed and answers to the Chief Justice of the Montana Supreme Court. Clerks and attorneys have raised concerns about giving full access to auditors who would be able to look into specific cases. A spokesperson for the clerks, Richland County Clerk Janice Klempel, issued a statement to the Daily Montanan on behalf of the association:


“I am very concerned that Montana citizens’ private, protected information may be released and we are weighing all our options, meaning the association is considering it.”
 
Another clerk confirmed they’re considering legal action because the clerks are concerned about giving access to information placed under seal by judges or data that would disclose minors and victims.
Sidney-based attorney Tom Halvorson submitted a commentary which has been published by the Daily Montanan, raising concerns about the need of auditors to examine confidential portions of the court records.
“Theoretically, the audit division needs that access to evaluate whether the state needs more district judges, and which districts might need them. What is not clear is how invading the privacy of Montana’s citizens would be relevant to that legislative task,” he said.
Halvorson pointed to concerns ranging from the identity of victims of sexual assault, DNA information and even grand jury raw data, he said in the column.
Eric Seidle, a spokesperson for the Legislative Audit Division, said that auditors have completed similar audits and studies, as recently as 2024, and are required by state law to maintain confidentiality. For example, members of the Legislative Audit Division have recently completed performance audits of the Office of Public Defender as well as the Judicial Standards Commission.
“Any access to sealed records will be done with the full cooperation of the judicial branch and will be strictly limited to the information necessary to validate case data,” Legislative Auditor Angus Maciver told the Daily Montanan.
He also outlined the data security standards for the auditors, which includes encrypting data in transit and storage, limiting the audit staff working on it, and destroying securely any non-essential information.
“More importantly, the Legislative Audit Act prohibits disclosing confidential information,” Maciver said.
  Who is in charge of what 

Part of the tussle is about which entities control the information. Court cases, both criminal and civil, are filed at the county level through each respective county clerk, whose office maintains the files. Many — but not all — of the files are open for public inspection.
However, those paper files are also stored in an electronic court filing system, “Full Court Enterprise.” In most cases documents are scanned, converted into electronic copies, as well as other parts the case are collected with it, including notes about scheduling and conferences. The Full Court Enterprise technology is owned, operated and maintained by the state court system, which is overseen by the state’s Supreme Court.
In most cases, county clerks maintain public-access terminals for members of the public to access court records. Most court cases, from misdemeanor to felony, civil or criminal, are open to the public with notable exceptions, for example, juvenile justice cases which are closed. Judges can also put certain documents ”under seal” which means they’re only viewable by the judge or attorneys, but not the public. Those files are not accessible to the public, but are accessible to some court staff.
Clerks raised the concern that they may be held responsible for maintaining the confidential of the records, but don’t have a say in whether auditors from the state access that confidential information.
In the letter by McAlpin, he said that access to the software is a settled issue.
“Users expressly consent to the audit of the (Full Court System) and files since 2024,” he said.
Citing Montana law, McAlpin also said it authorizes auditors to access records “confidential or otherwise,” acknowledging that auditors may also access confidential criminal justice data.
“By law, a person accepting (confidential criminal justice data) ‘assumes equal responsibility for the the security of the information with the originating agency,’” McAlpin said, citing state statute.
McAlpin sent the letter to the clerks’ association, and said that full access would be granted by 5 p.m., July 24, because auditors could not wait longer to begin the audit.
“This is to notify (the Legislative Audit Division) that we believe you have provided the requisite information and legal authority for this office to allow your agency access to the Full Court Enterprises for the purpose of this performance audit,” McAlpin said.
Maciver said he understands concerns regarding privacy, and auditors handle sensitive, confidential information in other state agencies, including the Department of Public Health and Human Services.
“Through this work, the Legislative Audit Division remains committed to upholding both transparency in government operations and the privacy rights guaranteed by the Montana Constitution,” Maciver said.

Vermont Green Football Club, the state’s semi-professional soccer team, will compete in the United Soccer League’s League Two eastern conference finals Friday night. 
The Green is set to face Virginia-based Lionsbridge Football Club in front of a sold-out crowd at Virtue Field in Burlington at 7 p.m.
Started in 2022, the Vermont Green has become a summer mainstay in the Queen City, filling the bleachers at the University of Vermont with devoted fans in club garb. The team, which has an environmental justice mission, includes college athletes from across the country and world, and features some of the University of Vermont’s national title-winners. 
This year, the Green went undefeated in the regular season, winning the USL League Two’s northeast division and advancing to the playoffs.  
In its most recent playoff match on Sunday, the Green came from behind to defeat previously unbeaten FC Motown 3-2.
Lionsbridge and the Green met once before in a 2022 playoff match, which saw the Vermont men knock off the Virginia side. If the Green win on Friday, they will play Sunday night in the league’s national semifinal, again hosted at Virtue Field. 
Tickets for Friday’s conference final sold out in under 30 seconds, the team said. Fans can stream the game here.

(Daily Montanan file photo)The Legislative Audit Division has asked the Montana Court Administrator to give it full access to all the raw data in a system called Full Court Enterprise. The system contains records from the  county offices of clerks of district court. Besides the public records of cases in those courts, the system includes no less than 32 categories of data protected by Montana law as private, confidential, or privileged. 
The court administrator has sent the audit division a letter  promising to give that access this week. 
Theoretically, the audit division needs that access to evaluate whether the state needs more district judges and which districts might need them. What is not clear is how invading the  privacy of Montana’s citizens would be relevant to that legislative task. 
For some examples, to assess the need for additional judges, why would the audit division need the names of minors; address, telephone number, and place of employment of crime victims;  information identifying victims of sexual assault, sexual intercourse without consent, indecent exposure, and incest; DNA from criminal proceedings; child abuse and neglect raw data; social,  medical, and psychological records of youth probationers; parentage raw data; interviews, reports, investigations, and testimony in parenting plan hearings under court seal; adoption raw data; grand jury raw data; investigative subpoena raw data; confidential criminal justice  information; pre-sentence investigation reports, etc. 
None of that contributes to assessing the need for additional judges, and if it did, the contribution would be too slight to outweigh individual privacy. 
The Office of Clerk of District Court is created in Montana by the people directly in our Constitution, not by the Legislature. It is a county and local government office, not a state office.  Clerks are elected officials responsible to the people, not minions of the court administrator. Montana law makes the clerks of district court the custodians of the records and imposes on them the duty to safeguard the data. Upon that lawful authority, the clerks have declined to give their consent to this invasion of privacy on a mass scale. They pointed out the privacy issue. The  clerks are the only barrier between the people and this state government trespass into their  privacy. 
Instead of submitting the issue to the courts, which would be normal, the court administrator  has brushed off the clerks and the Constitution in its autocratic decision to divulge the data. 
Without invading privacy, Montana law already mandates that performance indicators for district courts and individual judges be updated and published quarterly. In addition, there already is  public access to the public data in Full Court Enterprise. On top of all that, the clerks would would permit access to the system that would provide all the data and statistics that could be needed to decide about additional judges, but without access to data protected by privacy. Why is that not good enough? Why demand all private data about everyone in the district courts? Since it is not needed and not even helpful for the legislative task, why does the audit division want it and why would the court administrator divulge it?

Ted Wathen and Bob Hower will talk about the exhibit “Documenting Kentucky: Three Photographic Surveys” at the Frazier History Museum at 5:30 p.m. on Sunday, July 27. The Frazier has discounted admission rates of $5 on the last Sunday of each month this summer starting at 5 p.m.

More than a few Kentuckians can probably relate to the experience Ted Wathen had many years ago driving home to Louisville from Frankfort.
The sun broke through the clouds — “what photographers call a God-ray,” Wathen says. 
“I’m looking at the landscape and I thought this state is really beautiful.”
It was 1975.
Wathen, fresh out of the University of Florida with an MFA, had been talking to people in state government about the next year’s national bicentennial observance and its artistic possibilities. His pitch must have been good. 
He landed grants from the Kentucky Arts Commission and the National Endowment for the Arts and recruited photographers Bob Hower of Louisville and Bill Burke of Boston to join him.
Their goal was to document all 120 Kentucky counties, and they spent three years doing it.
“Twenty dollars a day, no salary and all the film  you could shoot,” Wathen recalls. “We lived out of our cars. I wouldn’t stay in a hotel if it was more than $10.”
In 1979,  the International Museum of Photography at the George Eastman House in Rochester, New York, exhibited the Kentucky Documentary Photographic Project. The museum also toured the exhibit.






































































Sixty prints from the project are in the collection of the Smithsonian American Museum of Art where they were exhibited in a show entitled “Exposed and Developed.”
Fast forward three decades. “Bob’s wife said ‘y’all should revive that.’”
They did in 2011 with an exhibit entitled “Rough Road” at the Frazier History Museum in Louisville. They scanned their negatives from the bicentennial collection and made larger digital prints. The response to the show inspired them to enlist a decidedly more diverse group of photographers to renew the project in a new century.
“We were three upper middle class white boys with graduate degrees.” The group that fanned out across Kentucky from 2015 to 2024 includes photographers from Pakistan, Colombia, Peru, Tunisia, “three or four African Americans and I don’t know how many women photographers,” said Wathen.
The new work is on display at the Frazier History Museum, along with the original trio’s bicentennial-era photos and what Wathen calls “another amazing body of work” shot in Kentucky from 1935 to 1943.
As part of President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal, photographers were dispatched across the country by the Resettlement Administration and Farm Security Administration to document the Great  Depression. Photographing in Kentucky, says Wathen, were Russell Lee, Ben Shahn, Carl Mydans, Esther Bubley, John Vachon and, most notably, Marion Post Wolcott.
“Documening Kentucky: Three Photographic Surveys” exists in movements, like a symphony, says Wathen. 
“It’s a visual tone poem to the state of Kentucky.”
The photos will be exhibited through November at the Frazier History Museum, 829 W. Main Street in Louisville.
The museum is generally open from 10 a.m. until 5 p.m. Monday–Saturday and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday. For more information and to order tickets click here.

Free.,Tumult over Epstein files dogs Trump in both DC and Florida,"Ashley Murray, Christine Sexton",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/tumult-over-epstein-files-dogs-trump-both-dc-and-florida,,"WASHINGTON — The fallout over President Donald Trump’s handling of financier and Florida sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s case files permeated business on Capitol Hill Thursday, as Senate Democrats urged release of the information.Meanwhile, in Tallahassee, Florida, a top Department of Justice official interviewed Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s former girlfriend and a key figure in the growing controversy.David O. Markus, lawyer for Ghislaine Maxwell, speaks to reporters outside the Joseph Woodrow Hatchett United States Courthouse and Federal Building in downtown Tallahassee, Florida, on Thursday, July 24, 2025. (Video by Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix)Members of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary accused their Republican counterparts on the panel of “concealing the Epstein files” after they voted to quash an amendment from New Jersey’s Sen. Cory Booker, who proposed tying the start date of an opioid data collection bill to the release of Epstein case material.The committee’s tumult came a day after U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson sent his members home early for their six-week August break to avoid voting on efforts by both House Democrats and Republicans to make the files public.Before heading back to their districts, three House Republicans voted Wednesday with Democrats on a House Committee on Oversight panel to subpoena the Department of Justice to turn over all Epstein investigation records. GOP Reps. Nancy Mace of South Carolina, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Brian Jack of Georgia voted in favor of the push led by Pennsylvania Democrat Summer Lee.Earlier, House Oversight Chair James Comer of Kentucky issued a subpoena for an Aug. 11 deposition with Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence in Florida for conspiring with the financier to sexually abuse girls.‘Lies and obfuscation’Epstein died in his New York City jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal charges for sex trafficking minors. He pleaded guilty in 2008 in Florida for procuring and soliciting minors for sex.The wealthy broker was surrounded by a powerful circle of friends, including Trump. Attorney General Pam Bondi informed the president in May that his name appeared among many others in the case files, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday. The context in which Trump’s name appears is unclear.“We had the power today, the possibility today, to force out the truth regarding the Epstein files and the lies and the obfuscation that is happening by this administration,” Booker said after the GOP-led panel advanced an amendment offered by Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas that rendered Booker’s effort moot.Booker eventually withdrew his amendment after roughly 40 minutes of back-and-forth in the middle of a vote, and after Sen. Lindsey Graham vowed to help him with a separate funding issue related to the underlying bill to address opioid overdose deaths.“What we're trying to do with this bill is really good, and there's no end to this (Epstein debate). If this is a headline about ‘Cornyn blocks transparency of Epstein,’ then that would be sad because he's responding to your amendment that would make the bill, quite frankly, fail,” said the South Carolina Republican. “I don't think it’s helpful.”Schumer calls for private Senate briefingSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer also put a spotlight on the Epstein case in his floor remarks Thursday, calling for the Trump administration to provide a closed-door briefing for all senators on details uncovered during the Epstein investigation, including whose names appeared in relation to the sex offender.“The Senate deserves to hear directly from senior administration officials about Donald Trump’s name appearing in these files and the complete lack of transparency shown to date,” Schumer said.Trump and his supporters, including some now working in his administration, dealt in conspiracy theories for years on the information surrounding the Epstein case, including whose names turned up during the investigation and the circumstances of his death.A July 7 Department of Justice memo poured cold water on the fervor, declaring no incriminating “client list” exists and that officials would not be releasing any materials because of the risk of revealing victim identities. The department concluded Epstein harmed over 1,000 victims.Trump answered swift and sharp criticism from his voter base by calling them “weaklings” for falling for a “Jeffrey Epstein hoax” in several social media posts.In lieu of releasing the files, he ordered the unsealing of grand jury testimony in the case, which a Florida federal judge blocked Wednesday.The president also told reporters that it was “appropriate” for Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, his former criminal defense lawyer, to interview Maxwell.Interview at Florida federal courthouseBlanche traveled to Florida, where reporters Thursday waited at the Joseph Woodrow Hatchett United States Courthouse and Federal Building in downtown Tallahassee, where the U.S. attorney's office is located.

The courthouse is about 4 miles from the city’s Federal Correctional Institution, where Maxwell is serving time.Blanche arrived around 9 a.m. Eastern at the courthouse, according to media reports. Maxwell’s appellate lawyer, David O. Markus, told ABC News, “We're looking forward to a productive day” and declined further comment.Markus, a Miami-based attorney with the firm Markus/Moss PLLC, emerged just before 4 p.m. Eastern and told news media outside the courthouse, including the Florida Phoenix, that Blanche “took a full day and asked a lot of questions, and Ms. Maxwell answered every single question.”“She never invoked a privilege, she never declined to answer. She answered all the questions truthfully, honestly and to the best of her ability, and that’s all the comment we’re going to have about the meeting. We don’t want to comment on the substance of the meeting for obvious reasons,” Markus said.Christine Sexton reported from Tallahassee.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-07-24 17:57:08.942244
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-24 21:22:35+00:00,CT Mirror,"Lamont campaigns now, an official candidacy to come later",Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/24/ned-lamont-governor-campaign/,"Every day, Lamont walks and talks more like a candidate for reelection, as was evident at an event promoting an 'Early Childhood Endowment.’","Every day, Gov. Ned Lamont walks and talks a little more like a candidate for reelection, as was evidenced Thursday at an event promoting an “Early Childhood Endowment” that promises to create 1,000 child care slots through next June, then provide free or subsidized care pegged to income, beginning in 2027.
“I try not to think about the politics of it. Or the polls about it,” said Lamont, who signaled an interest in a third term a month ago without declaring his candidacy. “Trying to put that off as long as I can. But I don’t think I can put it off that much longer.”
The early childhood event was scheduled prior to news the previous day of a poll from a liberal coalition testing messaging to use against the fiscally moderate Democratic governor in a potential primary. But it was very much a response to weeks of grumbling that Lamont is not sufficiently progressive.
Beth Bye, the commissioner of the Office of Early Childhood, which has gone from a bureaucratic backwater to a high-profile policy shop, cast the new endowment as broadly transformative for working poor and middle-class parents struggling to climb the economic ladder in an expensive state.
“Parents in Connecticut are paying up to 25% of their income” for child care, Bye said. “That means it’s harder to buy a home. That means it’s harder to get a car, to get transportation to work. Child care costs, if you talk to any parents, are stopping the ladder of opportunity that our governor’s trying so hard to build.”
Bye said Connecticut’s approach to providing a stable source of funding for early education — an off-budget trust fund that required Lamont to compromise on his aversion to placing spending outside the state’s so-called fiscal guardrails — has drawn national attention.
It seems to have solved the riddle of how to raise teacher wages without making care more expensive, and lower costs to parents without lowering wages.
Bye spoke outside in a play area at the Trinity College community child center in Hartford, shaded by a towering grove of trees. Lamont stood with Treasurer Erick Russell, whose office is central to investments in a “baby bonds” program for children born to families receiving Medicaid and the new endowment.
Most of Bye’s professional life has centered on early childhood education. She is the former director of the Trinity center, and she was a state senator sponsoring the creation of the Office of Early Childhood
Two teachers, including one on maternity leave with a newborn who slept in stroller, were standing by to tell their stories of struggling to keep jobs in a profession that they described as a calling, albeit one that paid poorly. Three lawmakers, Democrats in varying stages of overall agreement with Lamont’s politics, would offer unstinting testimonials about the new trust fund.
One of the lawmakers, Rep. Brandon Chaffee of Middletown, is the parent of two young children. He said that he and his wife spend more on day care than they do on the mortgage for their home.
“This is a revolutionary investment in the future of Connecticut that will allow families to access the care that they need for their children, not just through available spots, but for reasonable costs as well,” Lamont said. “Providers will have new tools to support and expand their care centers, and they will be healthier with newly provided access to health insurance programs.”
A racially diverse throng of little kids greeted the 71-year-old governor, who became a first-time grandfather 14 months ago.
“I’m four and a half,” one girl shouted.
“Guess how old I am,” Lamont said.
All that was missing was a campaign video crew.
“I don’t think about it that way, but it’s item one in terms of making sure that we make life a little more affordable, especially for our young families,” Lamont said after the event. “This can save them seven, eight, 15 thousand dollars a year, and it’s item one in terms of opportunity for folks. That’s what we’ve been all about for the last six years. That’s what we’re going to keep doing.”
Also greeting the governor was Daniel Lugo, the new president of Trinity. He was accompanied by a senior Trinity administrator with a part-time job at the Capitol: House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford. 
They chatted amiably, despite Lamont’s veto of an omnibus housing bill Rojas helped negotiate with the governor’s office. The veto was part of the poll testing the depth of Lamont’s support among likely Democratic voters.
There was no mention of that Thursday. Rojas is currently engaged in trying to draft a new version of the housing bill ahead of an expected special session this fall.
The three Democratic lawmakers present to praise Lamont and Bye for passing a bill creating an endowment seeded with $300 million in surplus funds all had voted for the housing bill: Chaffee, Kate Farrar of West Hartford and Mary Welander of Orange.
Welander was not one of the suburban Democrats rattled by opposition to a bill that would have eased housing construction. One provision would have made limited housing projects a matter of right in commercially zoned properties.
“My district is tricky with housing, but I supported the bill and really did not get that much pushback at all, because people recognize that change is needed,” Welander said. She said she told the governor about the response from her constituents.
Her 114th House district stretches across the New haven suburbs of Derby, Hamden, Orange and Woodbridge. She flipped a Republican seat in 2020, succeeding the former House minority leader, Themis Klarides, who did not run.
Regarding the governor, Welander said her constituents are uncomfortable with using any one issue as a litmus test. 
Farrar, who represents a solid Democratic district, said the “core concerns” of her constituents turn on the state meeting its obligations in a time of federal cut backs, a demand that could be at odds with a governor opposed to raising taxes..
“What we can do to raise more revenue so that we’re not putting people in a situation where they’re losing their health insurance, children going hungry,” Farrar said. “And they’re really looking to us to make sure that our leaders take that seriously and that we have a plan for what the next year and the years to come would look like.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_8088-1024x760.jpeg,,,2025-07-24 17:57:08.942244

A U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Alabama removed attorneys from a case after one of them used AI to generate fabricated citations in the case. (Jemma Stephenson/Alabama Reflector)A federal judge Wednesday reprimanded three attorneys working for the Alabama Department of Corrections and removed them from a civil rights lawsuit involving the agency after one used artificial intelligence to do research for a court filing that led to fabricated citations.
U.S. District Court Judge for the Northern District of Alabama Anna M. Manasco also referred the matter, involving Butler Snow attorneys Matthew B. Reeves, William J. Cranford and William R. Lunsford to the Alabama State Bar Association and other licensing authorities.
“The court further finds that no lesser sanction will serve the necessary deterrent purpose, otherwise rectify this misconduct, or vindicate judicial authority,” Manasco said in the order she issued.
The attorneys had represented DOC in the case. Manasco also suspended proceedings for 30 days to allow the Alabama Attorney General’s Office to hire counsel to represent the ADOC.
Butler Snow declined comment on Thursday and a message was left with Lunsford seeking comment on Thursday. Lunsford has been awarded millions of dollars in contracts to represent the state in legal matters, almost exclusively in lawsuits of alleged wrongdoing by the ADOC. In December, the state awarded him a legal contract worth about $4.8 million. That was after Alabama offered him $14.9 million in July 2023 from contracts that were amended to allow him to represent the state. He was also awarded $7.68 million the previous month.
The attorneys represented DOC in a lawsuit brought by Frankie Johnson, who alleges that after being stabbed in Donaldson Correctional Facility in Bessemer in 2019, the department failed to provide adequate protection, resulting in a second attack the following March.
Earlier this year, the DOC attorneys attempted to get Johnson to deliver a deposition in June. Johnson’s attorneys said that would not give him enough time to prepare. In response, Reeves and Lunsford filed a motion arguing that Johnson could be compelled to testify.
The plaintiffs’ attorneys noted four questionable citations. One included a case that was not relevant to another issue; a second said a decision known as Kelly v. City of Birmingham was a federal case decided in 2021, when it was a state case from 1939, and two other citations referenced cases that did not exist.
Johnson’s attorneys found another fabricated citation in a second filing.
At a hearing in May, Reeves and Lunsford expressed remorse and apologized to the court and the counsel. Reeves said he had started using ChatGPT for dietary research, but then began using it for professional research and then other citations. Reeves did not check the accuracy of the citations.
Butler Snow said in a filing last month that the incident was “an isolated event” and did not find any other instances in which attorneys used artificial intelligence to generate court citations after reviewing 50 court dockets filed in Alabama federal courts or the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.
“The court has no difficulty finding that Mr. Reeves’s misconduct was more than mere recklessness,” Manasco wrote in an order. “In the light of repeated general warnings from federal courts about the risks of bogus citations generated by AI, as well as the persistent specific warnings, policies, and expectations of his colleagues and law firm with respect to AI, Mr. Reeves’s misconduct was particularly egregious.”
Cranford, who also works at the Butler Snow law firm, originally drafted the motion, which at first did not include the fabricated citations. He then submitted the draft to Reeves and Lunsford, who were supervising his work on the case. The draft was then edited to include the fabricated citations. He told the court that he reviewed the updated draft for grammar and typos, “but did not conduct an independent review of the legal authorities added,” according to Manasco’s order.
Lunsford said he did not realize that Reeves used AI to generate fabricated citations in filings to the court in the case.
Manasco wrote that Lunsford “simply made no effort whatsoever to verify the contents of the motions for himself (or even to ask someone else to check for him), despite his presence on these motions.” Manasco also criticized Lunsford for asking to be excused from the original hearing
“Both before and at the show cause hearing, Mr. Lunsford deepened rather than allayed the court’s concerns about his understanding of his professional responsibility with respect to court filings that bear his name in the signature block,” the judge wrote. The judge also criticized Lunsford for arguing that it was the first time Reeves had ever used AI to generate citations without providing evidence to back the claim.
“In any event, Mr. Lunsford made clear that performing (or verifying) legal research for each case is not something that he requires of the team he leads,” Manasco said in the order.
Manasco had signaled in May that she was considering harsher sanctions because incidents involving the use of AI continue to recur even though judges have issued training and imposed other education requirements.
“If fines and public embarrassment were effective deterrents, there would not be so many cases to cite,” Manasco wrote. “And in any event, fines do not account for the extreme dereliction of professional responsibility that fabricating citations reflects, nor for the many harms it causes. In any event, a fine would not rectify the egregious misconduct in this case.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_3842-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-24 17:57:08.942244

Catherine Cortez Masto wasted no time in making an endorsement.
The Nevada senator announced Thursday she’s backing Attorney General Aaron Ford in Nevada’s Democratic gubernatorial primary over Alexis Hill, the Washoe County Commissioner who just entered the race this week.
The winner will likely face Incumbent Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo in the 2026 Midterm Elections.  
Ford, a former Senate majority leader in the state Legislature who was first elected as attorney general in 2018, announced in December he had planned to run for governor. 
He was re-elected in 2022 by the largest margin of all statewide offices in a year where incumbent Democratic Gov. Steven Sisolak lost his re-election bid to Lombardo. Incumbent Democratic Lt. Gov. Lisa Cano Burkhead, who was appointed to the position a year earlier, also lost to a Republican challenger that year.
Hill, who has served on the Washoe County Commission since 2020, announced this week she would also seek the Democratic nomination. 
In a statement announcing her support, Cortez Masto said that Ford “has won tough races” and touted the work he has done as attorney general including going “after fraudulent landlords who are jacking up prices on working families and won more than $1 billion in settlements from taking on big drug companies.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DSC04320-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-24 17:57:08.942244

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Gov. Phil Murphy signed legislation Wednesday requiring the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission to create digital driver’s licenses, giving residents the option to present a mobile ID to verify their identity.
The rollout, however, remains more than three years away. It’s also likely the state will have to apply for a federal waiver because of Real ID requirements, which began in May.
Officials say the new law will help people who forget their licenses or IDs and also allow them to update their documents electronically.
“Digital driver’s licenses will make life easier for drivers across New Jersey,” Murphy said in a statement. “Innovation has always been at the core of who we are as a state, and my administration has embraced that spirit to deliver practical solutions that improve everyday life for our people. By bringing government services into the digital age, we’re setting a new standard for how the public interacts with State agencies.”
At least 15 states and Puerto Rico have implemented mobile driver’s license programs, with another 10 states and Washington, D.C., planning to follow.
The state budget allocates $1.5 million toward implementing mobile driver’s licenses.
Under the law, allowing a police officer or judge to look at a mobile license does not mean you are consenting to have them review the other contents of your phone.
The bill passed overwhelmingly in the Legislature earlier this year.
“Digital licenses mean residents can carry their ID securely and conveniently on their phones, whether they’re renewing it, verifying their age, or interacting with state services,” bill sponsor Assemblyman William Sampson (D-Hudson) said in a statement. “This legislation is about meeting people where they are and embracing the tools that make everyday tasks easier and faster.”
Individuals may continue to use physical licenses and are not required to switch to a digital license.

The reaction among legislative leaders, however, is decidedly negative.
Asked by text about a report from Punchbowl News on a new redistricting effort, state Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin responded with a horror emoji. 
“I know this is a topic being talked about in Washington,” she added, “but no one has asked us to do anything about redistricting.”
Punchbowl reported that U.S. Rep. Bob Onder of Lake St. Louis was at the White House on Tuesday and came away convinced Trump’s advisors want Missouri to act. 
“The president’s team is serious about it,” Onder said to Punchbowl. 
Missouri has eight seats in the U.S. House, six held by Republicans and two held by Democrats — the same total and partisan division it has had since a seat was lost after the 2010 census.
Missouri Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck of Affton said Democrats would fight any effort to change district lines that were just redrawn three years ago.
“This originated out of the White House,” Beck said. “This is a blatant power grab by an administration desperate to deflect from their cover up of the Epstein files and other things going on.”










We've already done that. To do it again would be out of character with the way Missouri operates.


– Chad Perkins, speaker pro tem of the Missouri House


The 435 seats in the U.S. House are allotted to the states every 10 years based on census results. When Missouri receives its allotment, the state Constitution mandates that lawmakers revise district lines. 
The last time lines were redrawn between censuses was in the 1960s, following the 1964 U.S. Supreme Court decision that districts had to be drawn as closely as possible in population to preserve equal representation, known as the one person, one vote decision.
In 2022, when the current districts were drawn, Republican leaders in the Missouri Senate had to resort to little-used maneuvers to outwit opponents within their caucus who wanted to break up the 5th District and push the partisan split to 7-1. The 5th District, which includes  Kansas City and sections of Jackson and Clay counties, has been Democratic for decades.
U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, who has held the seat since 2005, was re-elected in November with 60% of the vote.
Splitting those votes into adjacent districts, while bringing in enough Republican votes to carry the district, isn’t as certain as it may seem to aid the GOP, said state Sen. Mike Cierpiot, a Republican from Lee’s Summit.
“There’s a lot of Democrats in Jackson County,” Cierpiot said, “and if it’s a map that they promote that, once again, puts two or three of our Republican seats in play in a bad year, I would have trouble supporting that.”
 Political questions

The 2022 fight over redistricting came during a four-year period where hard-right conservatives in the state Senate fought almost daily with GOP leadership and its backers. This year, Republicans finally forged a truce that helped make their supermajority, holding two-thirds of the seats, far more effective in moving priority legislation.
The fight over redistricting was colored as much by personalities as policy, said U.S. Rep. Eric Burlison, a Republican from Springfield who won the 7th District seat in 2022. 
Then-state Sen. Bill Eigel of St. Charles, leader of the insurgents, couldn’t convince anyone that a 7-1 map was possible and safe for Republicans because of his personal conflicts with the leadership, Burlison said in an interview on Thursday with The Independent.
“It was more about people’s personalities than what were the facts,” said Burlison, a state senator at the time. “What was achievable in that session was marked by that.”
Tempers fray as Missouri Senate Republicans fight over Congressional map

The conflict was so bad that Eigel and Cierpiot nearly came to blows during a lunch break. It wasn’t the only moment where violence was possible, Burlison said.
“There were multiple moments where it almost came close,” he said.
In the Missouri House, where it is easier for leadership to shut down debate and quash factionalism, a top Republican leader said there’s no reason to revisit the current map.
“We do redistricting every 10 years,” House Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins of Bowling Green said. “We’ve already done that. To do it again would be out of character with the way Missouri operates.”
There may be some willingness to try a new redistricting effort. Cierpiot said he could support it if he is convinced Republicans would not lose seats in years favoring Democrats. But it could backfire, he said.
“Right now, in Missouri, we’re in a Republican wonderland,” Cierpiot said. “We’ve had decent years, and we haven’t had an off year since probably 2008, but I’m old enough to remember those things do cycle through.”
State Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, a Republican from Arnold, enthusiastically backs the idea.
“We should have written a 7-1 map” in 2022, she said. “Our failure to do so almost cost the GOP the majority in Congress. I’m up for it.”
It is encouraging, Beck said, that most Republican comments are opposed to the idea of redistricting again. But pressure could change that.
“I don’t know how much they’re gonna get pushed to change those views,” he said. “I’ve watched these people say things before and then change their mind.”
 Constitutional issues

There are a lot of legal questions, involving both the federal and state constitutions, that will be played out in the courts in states that try to redraw lines set after the 2020 census, said Justin Levitt, a professor of law at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.
Levitt, who monitors redistricting efforts nationwide and was deputy attorney general for civil rights at the end of President Barack Obama’s administration, said a redistricting effort in Missouri would create legal issues over minority voter rights.
Both of Missouri’s Democratic members of Congress, Cleaver and U.S. Rep. Wesley Bell of St. Louis, are Black.
To gain a seat, “you’d have to effectively target the minority communities of St. Louis and Kansas City,” Levitt said.
It would also create problems because the stated goal is to increase Republican representation in Congress, he said.
“The Supreme Court has said with crystal clarity that excessive partisan gerrymandering is unconstitutional, that it is inconsistent with basic democratic principles,” Levitt said. “It said that in the same breath that it also said that the federal courthouse doors are closed to adjudicating that claim, but just because the cops are not outside your door doesn’t mean shoplifting is legal.”
Missouri’s constitution is silent on whether lawmakers have the power to redraw lines outside the 10-year cycle of the census. That silence, Levitt said, would have to be interpreted by the courts.
“Other states have construed that constitutional time in their own state constitutions to say, once every 10 years and no more frequently,” he said.
 Efforts elsewhere

With a 219-212 majority — four seats are vacant, including three previously held by Democrats — Republicans are worried that a small shift in voter sentiment could put them again in the minority.
Texas, with a 25-13 split in favor Republicans, is looking at possibly moving five seats to the Republican column, according to the Texas Tribune. It took a telephone call from Trump to Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott to get it on the special session agenda amid concerns that GOP voters might be spread too thin.
In retaliation, California Gov. Gavin Newsome has threatened to redraw that state’s 52 districts, currently 43-9 in favor of Democrats, to counter the Texas move. 
So did New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, who told reporters Monday that it’s “too early” to make a definitive statement on the issue, the New Jersey Globe reported, adding he would speak to other Democratic governors about redistricting.
With Missouri now involved, it is clear that Trump is looking everywhere he can for new GOP seats, Levitt said.
“They’re casting a wide net,” he said. “The president seems to be abundantly nervous, and it wouldn’t surprise me that he is in desperation, looking wherever he can.”
Congressional districts are already gerrymandered so the result isn’t in question, Beck said. It is already hurting the country and redistricting between censuses makes it worse, he added.
U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner, who represents the 2nd District in eastern Missouri, received 54.5% of the vote in November and is the only member of Congress from either party in the state who did not win 60% or more of the vote.
“There’s only a select few seats that are actually up for grabs ever. The other ones are safe,” Beck said. “They’ve done this over time, and it’s a shame. Now the politicians pick their voters, instead of the voters pick their politicians.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TBB_2922_1-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-24 17:57:08.942244

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Federal immigration agents arrested 243 immigrants lacking permanent legal status during a nine-day enforcement operation in the Denver area, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced Wednesday.
The arrests occurred from July 12 to July 20. The agency said it had support from Homeland Security Investigations Denver, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, ICE’s Dallas field office, the Internal Revenue Service and a handful of other federal agencies.
It provided details for about 50 of the alleged crimes people were arrested for, including assault, theft and driving under the influence. One person was wanted for murder, and another was wanted for human trafficking.

ICE said 50 of the people detained are subject to removal orders. Four are alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang.
“By partnering with federal agencies, we have successfully apprehended individuals who pose a significant threat to public safety,” Robert Guadian, ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Denver Field Office director, said in a statement. He criticized Colorado’s law that prevents local law enforcement from cooperating with ICE and holding people past their jail release time for the purpose of immigration enforcement.
ICE did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the charges involved with the arrests and how many people from the operation have since been deported. The announcement names one person who has been deported following a murder and DUI conviction.
The arrested immigrants are from 17 countries, including Mexico, Venezuela, Honduras and Nicaragua.
The number of ICE arrests in the operation was an increase compared to recent similar time periods, according to figures from the Deportation Data Project, with information that runs through the end of June. Over nine-day periods since the start of May, there have been an average of about 104 arrests in Colorado. Between June 9 and June 17, there was a peak of 165 arrests, 60 of which were for people convicted of crimes.
Karen Orona, communication manager for the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition, wrote in a text message to Colorado Newsline that “every detention steals from our communities.”
“ICE’s hollow claims about targeting criminals have been exposed as lies, most shockingly when they deported legally present immigrants to a known torture camp in El Salvador. ICE targets asylum seekers, green card holders, and parents of U.S. citizens, then denies them due process in a system where legal help is a privilege, not a right,” she wrote. “No human being deserves to be disappeared into detention camps or deported to danger.”
The recently-enacted federal tax cut and spending bill set aside about $170 billion for immigration enforcement and $75 billion for ICE specifically, which could supercharge immigration enforcement across the country as the Trump administration pushes for more detentions and deportations.
Six locations in Colorado have been floated as potential new ICE detention facilities, according to documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union. There is already a private immigration detention center run by GEO Group in Aurora.

Free.,"Democrats, education groups call for Trump to unfreeze K-12 funds",Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democrats-education-groups-call-trump-unfreeze-k-12-funds,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Democrats on Thursday slammed the “assault” on public education by President Donald Trump’s administration, underscoring the impact of billions of dollars in funds still frozen for K-12 schools and ongoing efforts to dismantle the Education Department.Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono, who hosted a forum alongside several Democratic colleagues that also heard testimony from education leaders, advocates and leading labor union voices, said Trump is engaged in “an all-out, coordinated attack on public education.”The agency has seen a dizzying array of cuts, overhauls and changes since Trump took office as he seeks to dramatically redefine the federal role in education and take an axe to the agency.This month, the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily cleared the way for the administration to carry out mass layoffs and a plan to dramatically downsize the Department of Education that Trump ordered earlier this year.“How can we expect our schools to plan for the upcoming school year when they are confronted with chaos and uncertainty from this administration?"" Hirono said at the forum.Compounding the issue, the administration garnered bipartisan backlash after notifying states that it would be withholding $6.8 billion in funds for K-12 schools just a day before July 1, when these dollars are typically sent out as educators plan for the coming school year.The administration last week confirmed the release of a portion of those funds that support before- and after-school programs and summer programs, totaling $1.3 billion, but it has yet to release the remaining $5.5 billion that go toward migrant education, English-language learning, adult education and literacy programs, among other initiatives.“How dare they take the monies that you appropriated, that schools need right now, as schools start in the next two weeks, taking it away from summer school, from after-school, from kids that need English-language acquisition — how dare they do that?” Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said at the forum.“How come we have to constantly go in and sue them and sue them and sue them to get things that you already appropriated?” said Weingarten, who leads one of the country’s largest teachers unions.Jacqueline Rodriguez, CEO of the National Center for Learning Disabilities, said the withheld money was devastating to students with disabilities.“This funding delay is sabotaging student learning, educator preparedness and essential services, causing heavy impacts on those students with disabilities,” she said.“To educators, this isn’t a delay, it’s a breach of public trust,” she said, adding that the freeze is “forcing schools to make tough choices about how they now have to reallocate funding.”National school voucher programThe forum also took aim at a sweeping national school voucher program included in the mega tax and spending cut bill that Trump signed into law July 4.The permanent program starts in 2027 and allocates up to $1,700 in federal tax credits for individuals who donate to organizations that provide private and religious school scholarships.“What we are seeing is just a wholesale dismantling and disruption of the public education system,” said Denise Forte, CEO of the nonprofit policy and advocacy group EdTrust.“And with this new national voucher scheme — which is exactly what it is — that’s really about making sure that students from wealthier families who had already been participating in private schooling will have access to even more public dollars.”Former Education secretary speaks outEarlier Thursday, former U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona also criticized Trump’s “attacks” on education, including the billions of dollars in frozen funds.“The irony is, this is really impacting many of the communities that really were rooting for this current administration,” Cardona, who was Education secretary under then-President Joe Biden, said on a press call hosted by Defend America Action that also featured Karen Smith, a member of Pennsylvania’s Central Bucks School District School Board as well as Nick Melvoin, a member of the Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education.“They’re being impacted the most in many ways,” Cardona said. “I always say, all students are going to be impacted, but the students furthest from opportunity are going to be impacted the most and more severely and more quickly, so let’s put that perspective on what’s happening in education — policies have consequences, and the consequences are going to be felt for decades, just from what was done in the last five months.”",,,,2025-07-24 17:57:08.942244

Patrick Morrisey  gave updates on flood recovery in Wheeling, W.Va., during a news conference on Thursday, July 24, 2025. (West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey | Courtesy photo)Gov. Patrick Morrisey says he’s still working to secure more financial help for northern West Virginia days after President Donald Trump announced the state would receive its long-awaited federal aid for flooding.
Morrisey also said he’ll offer resources to local food pantries that have reported low supplies following flooding in June that killed 9 people in Ohio County and caused catastrophic damage in the area and Marion County.
“To the extent that there is a need for some additional food, we’re going to unlock some of those opportunities to make sure some of the local food pantries get some additional resources,” Morrisey said Thursday at a press conference in Wheelling. “We do not want anyone to be without food.”
Trump said Tuesday evening he granted West Virginia’s request for $11.7 million in disaster aid after Morrisey formally requested a disaster declaration June 20. The wait for relief spurred criticism from Democrats and residents, who questioned the lull in assistance.
Morrisey said the federal aid announcement was just the “first phase of an ongoing process.”
“Now, we’ve followed up with additional requests and amendments from the original application … to try to acquire more public assistance, as well,” he said. “I’m working hard to get more resources to recover.”
He is optimistic the area will receive additional assistance due to the level of damage.
The governor, who has already dealt with several major flood events since taking office in January, urged impacted residents to file a claim with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
“We’re not going to leave Ohio County or Marion County stranded,” he said. 
Morrisey said that Trump’s emergency declaration and state resources will give impacted residents access to aid that could help with temporary housing and home repairs, bridge repairs, personal property losses, transportation and child care. There could be help available for medical and dental expenses, as well.
Work continues in Ohio and Marion Counties to clear debris left by the flooding, Morrisey said. The National Guard removed more than 12,000 tons of debris in Ohio County and 480 tons in Marion County. 
“We know that [the Department of Transportation] has been very, very aggressive and doing a lot of positive things, clearing debris to assist with the first responders and the traveling public, restoring roadways and inspecting bridges,” Morrisey added. 



How to file a claim with FEMA:
If you’re a resident of Marion or Ohio County who suffered damage in the flooding, first file claims with their insurance providers and then file for assistance from FEMA in one of the following ways: 

Visit www.DisasterAssistance.gov  
Call FEMA’s helpline at 1-800-621-FEMA (3362)
Download the FEMA mobile app from your phone’s app store.

When applying, residents should have the following information ready:

Social security number
Address of damaged residence
Description of damage and losses
Current mailing address and phone number
Insurance information if available
Total household annual income

(NMDOH)For the first time since 2018, New Mexico’s syphilis rates have decreased, state health officials announced on Thursday.
According to a Department of Health news release, rates for both primary and secondary syphilis — the disease’s most infectious stages — dropped 31% between 2023 and 2024, to 25.3 per 100,000.
Congenital syphilis, which occurs when pregnant women pass syphilis to their children, decreased by 19.6% during the same time period. The department reported last spring, however, that New Mexico had experienced a 20% increase in congenital syphilis cases during 2023 and 16 fetal deaths reported. Former Health Secretary Patrick Allen issued a public health order that same year regarding syphilis after New Mexico ranked second in the country for congenital syphilis, as well as primary and secondary infections (that ranking was based on 2021 data).
Current data for the state’s Sexually Transmitted Disease Program shows the highest number of cases for primary and secondary cases in the Metro health region consisting of Bernalillo, Sandoval, Torrance, and Valencia counties between 2023-2024, with the highest rates in the Northwest region of San Juan, McKinley, and Cibola counties. The Metro region also had highest number of congenital syphilis cases during that time period, whereas the Northwest region was the only area in which the rate of congenital syphilis increased between 2023 and 2024.
Health officials, in a Thursday news release, said they attributed the reported decline to “comprehensive strategies including enhanced community awareness and outreach efforts, increasing testing and treatment, promoting doxy-PEP (post-exposure prevention medication), and strengthening partnerships with community, medical, and Tribal organizations.”
NMDOH Sexually Transmitted Disease Program Manager Janine Waters said in a statement the state is now “seeing the results of years of dedicated work by our team and partners across the state. Congenital syphilis is entirely preventable, so our continued focus on testing and treatment is saving babies’ lives and protecting families.”
NMDOH says its top priority is preventing congenital syphilis and recommends three screenings for pregnant women:

at the first prenatal visit.
during the third trimester.
at delivery.

June 24, 2025 | Photo By Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceSecretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Republican leaders of the Michigan House of Representatives were ordered to enter mediation and hash out their differences in an ongoing lawsuit related to the chamber’s subpoena requests against the Department of State.
The development continues the legal battle between Benson and the House Oversight Committee, which in April requested election training materials from Benson and her office, which later resulted in a subpoena, a contempt vote and the present lawsuit in House of Representatives v. Benson.
In an order issued Thursday by Court of Claims Judge Sima Patel, the court ruled that both parties were to meet at a later date at the Michigan Hall of Justice for mediation proceedings. The meeting will commence before Court of Claims Judge James Redford, and both Benson and House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) were ordered to be present.
If Redford allows either Benson or Hall to be absent from the meeting, they would have to designate a person authorized to negotiate a full and final settlement.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The parties were also ordered to file a joint table identifying the materials subject to the subpoenas along with a brief description of each item. That joint submission is to be issued to the court no later than 14 days after the mediation conference.
A date and time has yet to be set, the order states.
House Oversight Committee Chair Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay Township) in May asked the full chamber to hold Benson in civil contempt for her alleged failure to provide the materials, which the House moved as a resolution later that day.
The chamber’s Republicans have sued Benson seeking a declaratory judgment holding that the House issued a valid subpoena to which the secretary of state must comply. That lawsuit also seeks an injunction prohibiting Benson or the Michigan Department of State from modifying relevant records in the initial request.
20250724 Ord for Mediation Conf
Benson spokesperson Angela Benander told Michigan Advance on Thursday that working with an independent third-party mediator was an appropriate way to resolve the questions about disclosure of confidential election security-related information, and that’s what Benson initially proposed to DeBoyer on May 22. 
“We are glad the court agrees,” Benander said in a statement. “We look forward to meeting with Judge Redford and the House counsel to find the right balance between the need for transparency and the need to protect the security of our elections.”
The court’s most recent order was issued Thursday but Patel initially issued the order from the bench on Tuesday.
DeBoyer, in a statement on the matter issued Tuesday, said the move was a positive step toward “achieving the transparency we’ve been trying tirelessly to bring to Michigan government all year.”
“Our subpoenas are lawful and well within our prerogative – and our duty to the public – as the people’s representatives,” DeBoyer said. “Now, the Michigan Court of Claims is helping us get closer to the truth, despite Jocelyn Benson’s best efforts to evade accountability. Hopefully, we will be able to work together with the help of Judge Reford to finally make this obscured Secretary of State’s office more transparent.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250624_094648-1024x730.jpeg,,,2025-07-24 16:56:39.649777

Gavin Newsom that in part required background checks for ammunition purchases. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals found that provision violates the 2nd Amendment.,"In summary
California voters in 2016 passed a ballot initiative championed by Gov. Gavin Newsom that in part required background checks for ammunition purchases. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals found that provision violates the 2nd Amendment. 


The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down California’s first-in-the-nation law requiring background checks for ammunition purchases, another blow to the state’s gun control framework that has been pared down, case by case, since the U.S. Supreme Court dramatically expanded gun rights in a monumental 2022 decision. 
The California law that forced ammunition purchasers to pass a background check was passed by voters in 2016. Gov. Gavin Newsom, at the time the state’s lieutenant governor, championed the initiative and was its primary advocate. 
In 2018, before the law went into effect, a group of gun rights advocates and ammunition vendors sued to block the law. 
They were successful – in 2020, a federal district court judge handed down an injunction against the background checks of ammunition purchasers. But at the time, the 9th Circuit paused that order and allowed the law to take effect.
Two years later, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen that a New York concealed-carry law unfairly constrained people’s right to carry a gun, and California’s gun control regime was thrown into chaos. 
The 9th Circuit then sent the case on background checks for ammunition purchases back down to the federal district court. That court again ruled against the background checks. 
Today’s ruling helped clarify what a post-Bruen future could look like.   
“Given the fees and delays associated with California’s ammunition background check regime, and the wide range of transactions to which it applies, we conclude that, in all applications, the regime meaningfully constrains California residents’ right to keep and bear arms,” Justice Sandra Segal Ikuta wrote in the 2-1 majority opinion,
The law required face-to-face transactions from a licensed dealer. That effectively banned internet sales of ammunition, and any ammunition purchased out of state required that it be delivered from that state to a licensed dealer in California 
Purchasers would swipe a government ID and their information would be run through four databases, which searched for their criminal histories, any firearm prohibitions for mental health, restraining orders and whether they were on a wanted persons list. They would also have to pay a fee to have their information run through the state Justice Department’s firearms data repository. 
The question posed by the Supreme Court in the Bruen decision is whether a law “meaningfully constrains the right to keep and bear arms,” as specified in the Second Amendment, and whether it is consistent with the country’s “historical tradition of firearm regulation.”   
Using that test, the 9th Circuit previously agreed with California that an Alameda County zoning law prohibiting gun stores within 500 feet of a residential area, or a law that bans firearm sales on state property, are both constitutional. The reasoning behind those decisions was that people could still buy guns in Alameda County, or somewhere besides state property. 
The Rhodes case is different, the appellate court ruled, because it meaningfully constrains people’s ability to purchase ammunition, which previous 9th Circuit decisions have found is foundational to a person’s ability to own guns. 
In court, the state’s attorneys also proposed that California’s ammunition sales law conformed to the United States’ historical tradition of regulating guns, citing colonial-era laws or laws written after the Civil War. 
The court dismissed those arguments. 
“Because none of the historical analogues proffered by California is within the relevant time frame, or is relevantly similar to California’s ammunition background check regime, California’s ammunition background check regime does not survive scrutiny under the two-step Bruen analysis,” Ikuta wrote.
In a fiery dissent, Judge Jay Bybee said the decision failed to correctly apply the Bruen test, and that using the logic of the decision, any firearms regulation could be interpreted as a violation of the Second Amendment. 
“It is difficult to imagine a regulation on the acquisition of ammunition or firearms that would not ‘meaningfully constrain’ the right to keep and bear arms under the majority’s new general applicability standard,” Bybee wrote in the dissent.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/071222_GunFile_LV__012.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-24 16:56:39.649777

The audit, performed by the firm CliftonLarsonAllen LLP and released on Thursday, was ordered by the state of Connecticut in response to a $39 million budget shortfall that the district announced last year. District officials have claimed the reason for the shortfall was the loss of federal coronavirus money coupled with flat-funding from the city. In spring of 2024, the district adopted a budget with the plan to draw from its savings to fill an already existing $26 million hole. 
A district of nearly 20,000 students, Bridgeport has been plagued by bitter disagreements between Board of Education members and has cycled through six superintendents in the last eight years. Former Superintendent Carmela Levy-David went on a leave of absence in November 2024 and eventually left the district after parents and teachers complained about her leadership. 
When Chief Financial Officer Nestor Nkwo and Interim Superintendent Royce Avery took the helm in September and November 2024, respectively, they began looking for ways to downsize. This included cutting 27 administrative positions in December 2024, with 18 assistant principals to be eliminated in June 2025.  
In April 2025, the board voted for more cuts, including the loss of 20 teaching positions, kindergarten paraprofessionals, busing for over 2,000 students, a performing arts program and all the district’s librarians. 
The report noted that there was no evidence of fraud or that the district was using money for anything that wasn’t “legitimate district business.” But the auditors did discover that the district had incorrectly classified certain expenses, which they said was a “deliberate tactic” done with the aim of making their expenditures line up with what was written in the budget. 
Additionally, the auditors said the district had made transfers within its budget as a way of “artificially” covering up budget shortfalls. Board of Education members, the report said, either didn’t know about these practices or did nothing to stop them. 
“The board’s failure to exercise appropriate oversight allowed these financial manipulations to persist unchecked, contributing to systemic issues in transparency and accountability,” the report read. 
Board of Education Chair Jennifer Perez told The Connecticut Mirror in an email that they had only just received the report and couldn’t yet comment on its findings. 
“We will work closely with the state and the audit firm to ensure the report is formally presented and discussed at an upcoming Board meeting,” she said. 
The audit noted that the district had taken $16 million out of its account for retirees and used it to pay for human services, medical services and payroll. The auditors warned that this transfer could “ jeopardize the ability to meet future obligations.” 
An investigation into payroll accounts found no indication that any employee had received excess pay or benefits. But the auditors said that the cost of payroll had remained relatively consistent over the last three years, which did not explain why the budget had increased. 
The report noted that individual schools and departments have very little say in the budgeting. Schools are given a certain amount of money based on the number of students they have and average employee salaries, but the amount doesn’t account for any outside factors, like student achievement or the percentage of students who are identified as needing special education. Departments have complained about a lack of clarity around the budget, and said they have been “met with resistance” when asking for information. 
District administrators did not respond to requests for comment. 
State Department of Education Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker thanked the auditors and said that Bridgeport was at a “critical moment.” 
“The audit provides a clear and necessary roadmap to strengthen Bridgeport’s financial systems, including greater local board of education oversight, and restore confidence in its budgeting practices. This moment presents an opportunity to reset expectations and refocus our shared efforts on building a system rooted in stability, transparency, and trust—one that fully supports the 20,022 students in Bridgeport,” she said in a statement. 
In January, prompted at least partly by a letter from former board chair Christine Baptiste-Perez, state officials called district leaders and board members to a meeting in Hartford. The State Board of Education later voted to allow the state to intervene in the Bridgeport Public Schools by providing a “technical assistance team,” required training for Board of Education members and having the state approve the district’s permanent hire for superintendent. 
The state also expressed concern about the district’s ability to address special education needs, noting that the state was receiving an increased number of complaints and legal filings related to special education in Bridgeport. As of November 2024, the district had estimated a shortage of 31 special education teachers. 
Russell-Tucker said in a statement on Thursday that the state’s technical assistance team and other state partners will make sure that the district follows the 34 recommendations made in the audit. 
The recommendations include technical changes designed to create more transparent accounting practices, training for new employees and giving department heads greater input on the budget and the ability to review it regularly.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_20200225_135119-e1582667794488.jpg,,,2025-07-24 16:56:39.649777

The centers promise economic growth, but there are concerns about their environmental impact and that they create relatively few jobs.","Welcome to Mississippi Marketplace, our new roundup of economic and business news from around the state. This week we’re focusing on the artificial intelligence boom in Mississippi. 
Amazon is building two data centers in Madison County. An eight-building complex is coming to Meridian. An Elon Musk affiliate recently bought a power plant in DeSoto County, near Memphis.

The companies behind the data centers will invest $20 billion, an unprecedented amount, contributing to local government revenues and creating new jobs. 
However, data centers create relatively few jobs. And there’s concern about the environmental impacts of data centers and the amount of energy required to power them, and whether that will impact household power bills down the line.

But with the AI boom underway, more data centers are in the works around the country. BlackRock estimates that investment in data centers and AI chips could reach $700 billion a year by 2030. 
What do you think Mississippi’s role will be in the AI boom, and what can the state be doing to take advantage of it? Let us know what you think at marketplace@mississippitoday.org.
Elon Musk’s xAI establishes a foothold in Mississippi 
An affiliate of Elon Musk’s xAI has purchased a former natural gas power plant in DeSoto County, according to the Daily Memphian. While the company has been tight-lipped about its plans in Mississippi, Memphis’ mayor “suspects” that it will power xAI’s new supercomputer facility, Colossus 2, in Memphis. 

No details have been released about when the plant will be up and running but in an interview with CNBC in May 2025, Musk said that Colossus 2 would be done in six to nine months. 
Memphis residents have been critical of xAI’s presence, especially the environmental impact and strain on the city’s electric grid.

Readying Mississippi’s workforce 
Mississippi currently lags behind in AI talent and innovation, according to several reports, but recent investments are working to change that. Governor Reeves in June announced a $9-million commitment to AI workforce development and announced a partnership with Nvidia Corporation to expand AI education. A Brookings Institute report described the program as, “a fundamental shift in how states approach AI talent cultivation.” 
For interested Mississippians:

Applications are open for a four week paid course at Hinds Community College’s Jackson campus to prepare people for careers in Amazon’s upcoming data centers, which will be located in nearby Madison County. The data centers are expected to open in 2027 and will create 1,000 new jobs. The full-time program will run August 18 – September 16 at the Jackson campus. Learn more.

(Courtesy photo)Peter Steele, a former newspaper publisher who later directed communications for former Republican Maine Gov. Paul LePage, has been tapped as New England regional administrator for the U.S. Small Business Administration.
Steele’s appointment was announced in a press release on Thursday, though he assumed the presidentially appointed role directing New England small business support in February. Brian Hopkins, an agency spokesperson, said in an email that the agency waited until leaders for all 10 regions of the country had been appointed before issuing the news as explanation for the six-month lag.
The job was previously held by former Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Sandra Cano, who stepped down two months in, on the same day President Donald Trump took office. Cano, who had represented Senate District 8 in Pawtucket since 2018, resigned from state elected office in September 2024. She simultaneously suspended her reelection campaign two days before the primary, in order to take the federal job.
Steele brings a wealth of communications experience in corporate and government settings to the position directing New England small business support for the SBA, including through its flagship low-interest loan and disaster relief programs.
A Massachusetts native whose family owned the 131-year-old Provincetown Advocate newspaper in Cape Cod until its sale in 2000, Steele got his start in journalism as editor-in-chief of an alternative Boston weekly before founding and publishing the Twin City Times, a Maine-based weekly newspaper he led for 13 years, according to his LinkedIn. 
“As a former small business owner, I understand the challenges and obstacles that business owners face every day, especially when they are first starting up,” Steele said in a statement. “When I launched my own small business, I was unaware of all the programs and assistance that SBA provides. I want to make sure that all businesses in New England are aware of SBA and what we can do to help them grow and prosper.”
Steele also worked as the communications director for six years under LePage and as a regional representative for the U.S. Department of Labor, which he started under the first Trump administration. Most recently, he served as senior manager of corporate communications for Sappi North America Inc., a global paper and packaging manufacturer based in Boston.
As regional administrator, Steele will represent the federal administration’s new policies and procedures on small business support for all six New England states. His LinkedIn description of the job touts Trump priorities including “Made in America” manufacturing and efforts to eliminate fraud.

Betsy Coffia (D-Traverse City) leads a press conference to announce legislation that would ban the use of face masks and requiring clear identification for all law enforcement officers interacting with the public in Michigan. July 24, 2025 | Photo by Jon King/Michigan AdvanceIn a fiery press conference in Lansing, state Rep. Betsy Coffia unveiled Thursday new legislation aimed at banning the use of face masks and requiring clear identification for all law enforcement officers interacting with the public in Michigan. 
The “Justice Needs No Mask” bill comes in response to growing public concern over masked, unidentified federal agents conducting immigration raids and detentions across the country.
Coffia, who represents a largely rural district in Northern Michigan with a strong agricultural presence, said that the fear among migrant farmworkers and their families was just one factor behind the legislation, which is expected to be introduced Thursday.
“They are living in fear today. They are living in fear of being targeted by masked, unidentified armed men in unmarked vans,” said Coffia (D-Traverse City). “If we want safe communities in Michigan, this bill is a key piece of the conversation because justice needs to wear no mask, not in a free society, not in America.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Coffia described how disturbing it has been to see reports of masked agents snatching individuals—often without explanation or identification—from schools, workplaces, hospitals, and even courtrooms.
“To the average person, these incidents look like violent kidnappings. There is no way for the public, the people being accosted and grabbed, or even local law enforcement and local and state elected leaders to know who these folks are. That secrecy is at issue here. It creates a dangerous situation for those being snatched for our community and for local police as well.” Coffia said.
The legislation, which echoes federal legislation introduced by U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly), would prohibit law enforcement officers at any level from wearing face coverings or obscuring their identity when engaging with the public. 
However, Coffia noted there were clear exceptions. Officers would still be permitted to wear protective gear for disease prevention, or if they are in hazardous environments, or working undercover or conducting counterterrorism operations. The bill also mandates visible identification—such as a name or badge number—and clear display of the agency the officer works for.
While Coffia stressed that Michigan State Police and most local police agencies already adhere to transparency measures, she said the increasing use of masked federal agents implementing President Donald Trump’s mass deportation plan is what prompted this legislative push.
Coffia cited recent incidents, including impersonations of ICE agents, that led to sexual assault and attempted detentions, as evidence that the practice is being exploited by criminals. She cited the assassination of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband by a man allegedly dressed as a police officer and wearing a mask.
Joining Coffia at Thursday’s press conference were several co-sponsors of the bill, including Rep. Noah Arbit (D-West Bloomfield), who called the policy of masked detentions a fundamental breach of the contract between citizens and the state.
“This policy shreds the rule of law and shreds the contract that we have as citizens with law enforcement; to know why we are being apprehended and what law that we have broken,” Arbit said. “When you don’t know whether someone who is apprehending you is part of the state or not, it gives license to anyone who’s not part of the state to also commit violence, ideologically motivated violence, terrorism. That’s what this is, truly.”
Rep. Carrie Rheingans (D-Ann Arbor) compared the federal agent actions to historical authoritarian regimes, invoking the memory of the Gestapo, Nazi Germany’s secret police.
“We said ‘never again,’ and we meant it. ICE agents refusing to show their faces or identify themselves is not only wrong—it’s un-American,” Rheingans said.
Rep. Stephanie Young (D-Detroit) said the actions of ICE agents under the Trump administration evoke the dark side of America’s past, linking masked law enforcement today to the Ku Klux Klan’s history of racial terror—often perpetrated, she noted, with the complicity or direct involvement of local police.
“Justice wears no mask,” Young said. “People used to show up at Black families’ homes wearing hoods. Some of them were law enforcement. And now here we are in 2025, with masked agents scooping up people in our communities.”

Young warned that this issue goes beyond race or immigration status, arguing that all citizens are at risk when secrecy becomes the norm in policing.
“If it’s happening to brown people today, it can happen to anyone tomorrow,” she added.
Coffia acknowledged that passing the legislation may be challenging in a politically divided legislature. When asked by Michigan Advance if any of her Republican colleagues in the state House had expressed support, she said some have privately shared concerns but stopped short of committing to public endorsement.
“I know some of them are deeply disturbed by what’s happening,” Coffia said. “Whether that will translate into co-sponsorship—I can’t say.”
She said she has discussed the bill with Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, who has joined other attorneys general in pushing for a similar federal standard. Coffia said she believes there is strong support for transparency and accountability, even if the political path forward remains uncertain.
Young, however, hoped that Michigan could become a model for how states can push back against what they see as a dangerous and authoritarian federal overreach.
“We cannot be silent, because silence means complicity. And we refuse to be complicit in injustice,’ said Young.
Once introduced, the bill is unlikely to get a committee hearing in the GOP-led House.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9710-1024x562.jpg,,,2025-07-24 16:56:39.649777

MBTA General Manager Phil Eng said -- without describing any details about the latest apparent hiccup -- that he believes parties will be able to navigate the upheaval.
The post Eng confident ‘challenges’ to delivery of new MBTA trains will be resolved appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE HEAD OF the MBTA is “very confident” the Chinese manufacturer building new Red and Orange Line trains will be able to fulfill federal requests for information that have reportedly delayed delivery of new cars to the United States.
CommonWealth Beacon reported Tuesday that eight Red Line cars shipped from China to the United States were detained at the Port of Philadelphia as federal authorities examine whether CRRC, the manufacturer, is complying with a law banning the importation of goods produced using forced labor.
During a public meeting Thursday, MBTA General Manager Phil Eng said — without describing any details about the latest apparent hiccup — that he believes parties will be able to navigate the upheaval.
“While those challenges right now are going on, I do feel very confident that CRRC is in the midst of answering the last round of questions, and we will be able to get through this point where we can continue to deliver [train car] shells and continue production,” Eng said without making any explicit reference to a federal probe or questions about forced labor.
The Patrick administration first awarded a contract to CRRC in 2014 to build new Red and Orange Line fleets, and the project has been beset by numerous delays and setbacks since then. Last year, MBTA officials approved a contract “reset” that waived some penalties, pushed the total value to more than $1 billion and set the new completion date at the end of 2027.
President Donald Trump has been aggressively pursuing steep tariffs on China and other trading partners. Eng in March said that although the tariffs could impact CRRC, they would not “impact us [at the MBTA] and what we renegotiated.”
The T has received 48 Red Line cars from CRRC so far and expects to have 152 Orange Line cars by the end of the year, Eng said Thursday, praising the trains for “performing well.” CRRC ships components and train car “shells” to the United States, and final assembly takes place in Springfield.
“Those cars are being built right in Springfield, Massachusetts, [with an] over 400 US [personnel] labor workforce that is proudly building these cars,” Eng said. “Thirty-two states across the nation are delivering components to build those cars. We’re confident that we will solve this with CRRC. They are pulling all the information together. They will be sending answers, and I just want to assure everyone that we’re on top of that piece.”

Credit: FloridaRedistricting.govWith President Trump fearful that congressional Republicans could lose their slim majority in the House of Representatives in the 2026 midterm election, he has urged the state of Texas to redraw their congressional map to add as many as five GOP seats to Congress, and that he’d like other states to follow suit.
Gov. Ron DeSantis says that Florida can be one of those states.
“I think the state is malapportioned,” he said at a press conference in Bradenton on Thursday. “So I do think it would be appropriate to do a redistricting in the mid-decade. So we’re working through what that would look like, but I can tell you just look at how the population has shifted in different parts of the state over a four-to-five year period. It’s been really significant.”
District lines are typically redrawn once a decade to account for population changes in the U.S. Census, but there is nothing barring lawmakers from creating new maps in the middle of the decade.
The governor boasted on Thursday about how he had vetoed the original congressional redistricting map that GOP state lawmakers had approved during the 2022 reapportionment process, which he called “a disaster.” He then presented his own map, which erased Black representation in Northern Florida and overall increased the number of Republicans serving in Congress from 16 to 20 which the Legislature later did approve.
While voting rights groups sued to strike down that map, the Florida Supreme Court upheld it as being constitutional. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Carlos Muñiz said that legislators had a “superior” obligation to follow federal equal protection law, and not the Fair Districts Amendment passed by Florida voters in 2010. That law said that congressional districts cannot be “drawn with the intent to favor or disfavor a political party or an incumbent.”
The governor repeated that he believes that the state’s population was severely undercounted in the 2020 U.S. Census Count, and that along with the changes in population (which in Florida includes many more registered Republicans than there were in 2020), the time is now to redistrict Congressional seats, instead of waiting until 2032.
“I talked with the Commerce Secretary right when he got sworn in and I told him, we got a raw deal on the Census,” he said. ”We only got one seat when some of these other states were getting seats when we’ve obviously had more growth – we should have gotten at least two, and so they were going to re-do the count in time for 2026. Now they’d have to do that relatively soon because you need time to draw maps and you need time to get that done. “
Some early projections regarding the 2020 U.S. Census indicated that Florida would gain two congressional seats, but unlike other states which devoted millions of dollars towards ensuring an accurate count,  Florida chose not to invest in such an effort, as the Phoenix reported on in 2019.
There are currently eight Democrats in Florida’s 28-member congressional delegation. Punchbowl News speculated earlier this week that among the lawmakers that Republicans could target in a new map might include Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Jared Moskowitz and Lois Frankel in South Florida; Darren Soto in Central Florida and Kathy Castor in the Tampa Bay area.
Florida House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell blasted DeSantis’ remarks later on Thursday.
“Governor Ron DeSantis’ plan to consider mid-decade redistricting is an outrageous and dangerous abuse of power and an attempt to put Donald Trump’s agenda ahead of the people of Florida,” she said in a statement. “Redistricting is intended to occur once every ten years—following the Census—to reflect population changes, not to serve as a political weapon whenever those in power fear losing their grip. There is no legitimate reason to redraw Florida’s maps now—unless the goal is to serve partisan interests and protect political allies ahead of a critical election.”

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderRepublican John King dropped his U.S. Senate bid Thursday and says he will instead seek another term as Georgia’s insurance commissioner.
King announced his decision with a social media post at a time when other high-profile Republicans, like former Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley and U.S. Rep. Mike Collins, are increasingly seen as likely entrants in the race.
“I got into the U.S. Senate race to beat Jon Ossoff, not distract from the mission,” King said in a statement. “Right now it’s clear there’s little path forward to the nomination, so today I’m suspending my campaign.”
King recently reported raising $518,000 to fuel his campaign, lagging behind Republican Congressman Buddy Carter’s $3.5 million haul. Ossoff, meanwhile, reported raising more than $41 million in the most recent quarter.
King was originally appointed to the seat in 2019 by Gov. Brian Kemp, who heralded King at the time as the first Hispanic constitutional officer to serve statewide. He was elected to the office in 2022 after defeating a Trump-endorsed candidate in the GOP primary.
“I’m going to do everything I can to keep Georgia’s state offices red and back a Senate nominee who supports President Trump’s agenda,” King said in the statement exiting the Senate race. 
King launched his Senate campaign in May. Ossoff, who flipped the seat in 2020, is the only Democratic senator up for re-election in a state won by President Donald Trump in 2024. Trump beat former Vice President Kamala Harris in Georgia last year by about 115,000 votes. 
Party leaders, particularly Kemp and Trump, have reportedly been working behind the scenes to identify a candidate who can unify a splintered Republican party. No candidate has yet publicly emerged from those talks.

The $500,000 report produced by the University of Michigan’s Youth Policy Lab offers several recommendations aimed at improving education, centered on the bodies that govern education in the state, the structure of school districts, the state’s school choice system and how Michigan’s education system is funded. 
Alongside the report’s release, Department officials released a statement, with state Superintendent Michael Rice saying the department “agrees with some findings in the report and disagrees with others,” and that the report offers no significant new research or insight on education policy or ways to improve student achievement. 
Alongside statistical analyses of administrative data, the report also draws from existing academic papers, policy reports and government documents, while incorporating interview and survey responses from several stakeholders including superintendents, school authorizers, representatives from educational associations, education professionals and researchers who have studied Michigan schools and their governing bodies.

The recommendations most hotly contested by the board were proposals to increase the governor’s authority over the State Board of Education and the choice of the state superintendent. 
Specifically, the report recommends moving toward a system where at least some members of the State Board of Education are appointed by the governor. It also suggests multiple approaches in giving the governor authority in how a superintendent is selected, ranging from making the role one of the governor’s cabinet positions, to having the governor select a superintendent from a list of candidates provided by the board or requiring the board or the Legislature to approve the governor’s selection for the role. 
Currently members of the state board of education are nominated by the state political parties at their nominating conventions. Every two years, Michigan voters select two candidates to serve eight year terms, with members of the State Board of Education appointing the state superintendent to serve as a nonvoting member and chair of the board.
The report acknowledges that any change to this system would likely require changes to state law and the state constitution. 
MI_Ed_Governance_Full_Report
Politicians have mulled several changes to the Board of Education’s structure in recent years with state Rep. Bill G. Schuette (R-Midland) introducing a proposed constitutional amendment earlier this year that would place the governor in control of nominating the state superintendent. Rep. Cam Cavitt (R-Cheboygan) also introduced a bill dividing the state into four districts and requiring state political parties to nominate candidates from all four districts on a rotating cycle, arguing it would improve representation for rural and northern Michigan districts. 
In 2024, a bipartisan committee of political consultants sought to partner with the legislature on a proposed constitutional amendment that would have taken the nominating process for attorney general, secretary of state and state Supreme Court justices away from state party conventions and place candidates before voters in the primary election.
One version of their proposed constitutional amendment would have placed candidates for the state Board of Education and the boards for University of Michigan, Michigan State University and Wayne State University before primary voters, while another would have allowed the governor to appoint members to the board of education and the three university boards with the advice and consent from the Senate.
While the report cites a common view amongst stakeholders that the board is ineffective and mired in partisan politics, Board President Pamela Pugh, a Democrat, said proposing giving the governor control over nominations as the solution was laughable. She emphasized that it is the people of Michigan who decide who they want to oversee the board. 
“We come from our two different parties, but imagine if a governor were to appoint boards. That would definitely bring politics to the table. And we serve eight year terms. With a governor appointing we could be seeing flip flopping of board members every four years,” Pugh told the Michigan Advance.
Pugh is also a candidate for the Michigan Senate.
In April, the State Board of Education unanimously approved a resolution brought by Tom McMillin, a Republican, to oppose Schuette’s resolution. 
“Our board supports many of the efforts that Governor Whitmer has put forward to strengthen education, but this push to expand gubernatorial control over the State Board of Education and the superintendent, it lacked data,” Pugh said, arguing such an effort would undermine the state’s constitutional safeguards.
Additionally, Pugh argued the governor has plenty of influence over the board including their influence on party nominations, their role as an ex-officio member, and the engagement of board liaisons. 
“I will tell you that some board liaisons come and they have a name plate, and they sit at the table and they are part of the discussions with us. Some have participated only via Zoom. And so we have those different spectrums of participation, but we definitely welcome the governor, through that liaison, to participate as much as they want,” Pugh said. 
When asked about the report and its proposals, Whitmer Press Secretary Stacey LaRouche stressed the governor’s work providing record levels of funding for students, and hiring more teachers and literacy coaches to help address the state’s lagging literacy rates.
“We know we need to get our schools back on track, and improve literacy scores across the state. We remain committed to working with anyone to tackle the literacy crisis and put our students first, so that every kid in Michigan can learn how to read and earn the bright future they deserve,” LaRouche said. 
While the changes in governing structure represent the most salient point of disagreement for the Department of Education and the board, Rice highlighted several areas where the board agreed with the report’s findings. 
“On finance, the report says we’re underfunded. We agree,” Rice told the Advance. 
Similarly the department and the state board agree they should reduce the reliance on categorical funding, though Rice noted they wanted to retain specific categories, including at-risk funding, funding for students with disabilities, mental health and school safety and funds for universal school meals among other categories. 
Looking at school of choice, Rice also noted the Board’s support for greater financial accountability for charter schools, as well as greater oversight in where charter schools are sited. 
“We have 21 public school districts in Genesee County. We have 14 public school academies in Genesee County with 35 school districts as a result 21 plus 14 for 61,000 children. In Maryland, that’s a school district. That’s a single school district. In Michigan it’s 35 school districts, and it manifests itself in an inefficiency. And that inefficiency manifests itself in terms of a frittering away of resources that would be better spent on children in classrooms,” Rice said. 
The state would also do well to have stronger oversight over certain issues, Rice said, pointing to early literacy and early numeracy as examples. 
In Fall 2024 Whitmer signed legislation to improve training for teachers in early literacy, require the use of science of reading materials and require dyslexia screenings for all students in Kindergarten through 3rd grade alongside older students who demonstrate behavior indicating dyslexia. 
This creates a system of greater required involvement, Rice said. 
“This is not an advocacy for changing an authority structure across the board. It’s about the changing of an authority structure in early literacy,” Rice said.
Additionally the department would like to see a coupling with local education agencies, intermediate school districts and the state department on issues like early literacy and early numeracy, Rice said. 
While the department and the school district can influence items in the instructional phase, they do not have any sort of authority, he explained, noting any change would require action from lawmakers.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250603_094859-1024x910.jpg,,,2025-07-24 16:56:39.649777

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
Communities impacted by the devastating floods that swept through Vermont in July 2023 can now apply for a cut of long-term federal disaster aid.
State officials have opened the application process for nearly $68 million in federal recovery money allocated to the state late last year. Officials hope to funnel the majority of the funding toward housing development outside of flood-prone areas.
“We recognize that housing is a crisis across the whole state, and especially in these flood areas,” said Nate Formalarie, deputy commissioner of the Department of Housing and Community Development, which is administering the federal block grants. “If future storms are to come, we need to have places to put people.”

A state analysis found that Vermont has over $350 million in unmet flood recovery needs tied to the 2023 storm alone, with the bulk of that need stemming from costly damage to public infrastructure like power, wastewater and transportation systems. 
But state officials plan to direct more than 60% of the federal disaster aid — over $41 million —  toward housing development. Smaller portions of the block grant will be set aside for infrastructure projects, flood-mitigation efforts, future planning and program administration, according to a state action plan approved by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Asked why officials opted to channel much of this funding toward housing specifically, Formalarie emphasized the state of Vermont’s extraordinarily tight housing market — and the loss of homes to flood damage and property buyouts. The pot of money available to the state pales in the face of the overall need, he said.
“There is a need to replenish some of these housing options in these communities that are getting flooded year after year,” he said. Applications for infrastructure that supports new housing development will get considered as part of the housing category for funding decisions, he added.
The feds’ rules dictate that the majority of the disaster funding must flow to Lamoille and Washington counties, which were both particularly hard hit by the flooding two years ago. State officials have earmarked the remaining funds for unmet flood recovery needs in Caledonia, Orleans, Rutland, Windham and Windsor counties. The funding must primarily benefit low- and moderate-income residents.
This type of federal funding isn’t a given after a disaster strikes. Unlike immediate relief funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which can start flowing right after the president declares a disaster, Congress has to take action to appropriate these more flexible, long-range funds. The money allocated to Vermont came out of a disaster aid package that federal lawmakers passed in December.
This form of disaster aid also offers a rare opportunity to build new housing outside of the floodplain. While FEMA’s aid programs generally tie a homeowner to rebuilding on the site of their damaged home, for instance, or buy them out with no guarantee of an available home to move into, these more flexible funds can allow a community to create homes where they didn’t exist before.
Barre City, which has been hit repeatedly by major floods in recent years, has a long list of housing projects it’s considering as it puts together an application for the disaster funding, said City Manager Nicolas Storellicastro. One major priority is financing the infrastructure for new homes at the proposed Prospect Heights development, an undeveloped site near the city’s downtown.
The city also wants to jumpstart the revitalization of the flood-prone North End neighborhood, using some of the funding to build affordable homes at a park outside the floodplain, Storellicastro said. Redeveloping a long-vacant downtown building and funding more home elevations are also on the list, he added.
Between all of those projects, the city plans to apply for around $30 million from the federal funding pot. As Barre loses dozens of homes — and property tax revenue — to buyout-takers and lingering flood damage, the funding could make a meaningful difference, Storellicastro said.
“That would be a big step forward, not just to address the housing crunch, but to help the city’s tax base,” he said.
State officials are asking municipalities and local organizations interested in a shot at the funding to submit pre-applications by Aug. 5, with full applications due in late September. A citizen board will review them according to a rubric and make recommendations to Lindsay Kurrle, secretary of the Agency of Commerce and Community Development, and Gov. Phil Scott, who will have a final say on application decisions. 
The state hopes to begin awarding funding before the end of 2025.

Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesThe president of the country’s postal union is sounding the alarm on privatization of the service.
And in Montana, some residents might soon start seeing TV commercials from the American Postal Workers Union seeking to “alert the public” of privatization attempts of the service.
The ad campaign, which is in eight states, follows a Wells Fargo Equity Research document to investors which includes plans to close post offices as well as higher prices for those using the service.
It also includes an end to the “Universal Service Obligation,” which is essential that all postal users receive a minimum level of service at a reasonable price and requires six day-per-week mail delivery.
“There is an intensified effort really coming from the billionaires and Wall Street about privatizing the public United States Postal Service,” APWU president Mark Dimondstein said in an interview with the Daily Montanan. “Which means either breaking it up in whole or piecemealing it out whole or in part to private companies that then decide who gets mail under what conditions, based on whether somebody can make a profit.”
The document from Wells Fargo details five steps that would need to be taken in order for the service to be privatized, starting with new legislation. It would take a Congressional Act and signage by the president for that to happen, the document states.
The document also said that $400 billion in pension and health care liabilities need to be addressed. The USPS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“Our sense is these liabilities would likely be moved to another entity (likely to the US taxpayer where they arguably are now) since potential buyers and/or investors would be reluctant to assume such a large legacy liability, but could be addressed through a parcel sale/IPO or real estate monetization,” the document states.
The Postal Service is currently funded by its own revenue. Other steps outlined in the report include employees losing jobs.
“Especially amid recent DOGE efforts on federal cost control, it is likely that employees receive a type of deferred buyout offer to leave or layoffs could ensue,” the report says.
It also said the USPS would need to raise its prices on parcels 30%-140% to “reach pricing parity with parcel competitors.”
President Donald Trump has described the postal service as “a joke” and the appointment of David P. Steiner, a former FedEx executive, to the position of Postmaster General. These moves have the APWU concerned.
The ads will run in Alaska, Oklahoma, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Dakota and nationally on CNN, MSNBC, and FOX.
“This is really part of our foundation, part of how the country was built, and it’s going to help propel us forward,” Dimondstein said. “And in that sense, it’s a source of pride for the entire country, certainly a source of pride for those who do the work and serve the people.”

He called 911 to report it. (Provided by Jason Brocar)Thousands of acres in South Carolina’s national forests could have roads built through them if the federal forest service revokes a longstanding rule meant to keep those acres pristine.
Since 2001, a federal rule has prohibited building new roads through millions of acres in government-owned forests nationwide. The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced a plan last month to rescind the so-called “roadless rule,” calling it outdated and “overly restrictive,” in a move that raised alarms among conservationists.
“This move opens a new era of consistency and sustainability for our nation’s forests,” USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a statement. “It is abundantly clear that properly managing our forests preserves them from devastating fires and allows future generations of Americans to enjoy and reap the benefits of this great land.”
South Carolina has 8,000 of roadless acres in its two national forests, according to the National Forest Service. That’s just over 1% of the forests’ total acreage, since Francis Marion National Forest covers 259,000 acres in Charleston and Berkeley counties, and Sumter National Forest spans more than 375,000 acres in three divided sections across the state.
South Carolina has a fraction of the roadless acres found in neighboring states. Georgia has 63,000 roadless acres, and North Carolina has 172,000, according to the National Forest Service.

The proposed change would shift more forest management responsibilities to states, allowing local officials to decide whether to build new roads, reconstruct defunct roads or harvest timber in the protected areas. That will also give officials more flexibility in preventing and responding to wildfires, the USDA said in a news release.
The proposal is part of a larger effort under President Donald Trump’s administration to remove regulations seen as overly burdensome, according to the news release.
The rule remains in place for the time being. Rescinding it will require an environmental analysis, conversations with state leaders and a public input process. The USDA has not yet set a timeline for when those parts of the process might happen.
Preventing encroaching development, particularly from growing subdivisions, was a major reason behind prohibiting roads on certain land, according to the rule itself.
“In an increasingly developed landscape, large unfragmented tracts of land become more important,” the rule reads.
The relative rarity of South Carolina’s roadless acres “makes them even more important to protect,” the Southern Environmental Law Center said in a statement.
While roadless means no vehicles, nature trails are allowed.
Hikers, kayakers and mountain bikers enjoy the areas for being quiet respites away from everyday technology, said Sam Evans, who runs the law center’s National Forests and Parks Program. Animals, including endangered species, depend upon the untouched forests for habitats, and visitors promote tourism in nearby communities, he said.
“People in the Southeast and across the country want a place to get away from the noise and commotion of roads and development,” Evans said in a statement. “The Roadless Rule promises that our least-developed public lands can be enjoyed by all of us for generations to come without the threat of reckless roadbuilding and other destructive projects.”

National forests are still active forests, and people with permits can harvest timber or mine within their boundaries. That’s not the case in roadless areas, where logging is prohibited and mining is rarer because of the lack of roads to access them, Evans said.
Getting rid of the rule “would open these areas to mining, oil and gas development, and timber production,” Evans said.
April Donnelly, a lobbyist for South Carolina’s branch of The Nature Conservancy, pushed back on the idea that repealing the rule would help prevent wildfires. Forest managers are already allowed to clear debris to reduce the risk of wildfires, so long as the work doesn’t involve building new roads, under the existing rule. While wildfires in roadless areas can burn longer because firefighters can’t reach them, fires aren’t more common in roadless areas than those with roads, Donnelly said.
“National forest managers routinely conduct forest stewardship activities like controlled burning within roadless areas, and can sell forest products derived from roadless areas,” Donnelly said in a statement.
Protecting untouched land becomes even more important as the climate changes, Donnelly said. The roadless acres have a significant overlap with areas the environmental nonprofit has deemed important for maintaining ecological diversity, she said.
“As such, this proposed change to the conservation status of roadless areas could have significant impacts to the protected status of important habitats that possess unique topographies, geologies and other characteristics uniquely suited to be more resilient to changing temperatures and conditions,” Donnelly said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FB_IMG_1724779641146-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-24 16:56:39.649777

In light of the Republican majority so far declining to bring Maine Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden’s Protect America’s Workforce Act up for a floor vote, Golden last week introduced a discharge petition, which if endorsed by 218 members would force a vote on the bill.
Maine’s other representative, Democrat Chellie Pingree, signed the discharge petition the day Golden introduced it. So far, only two Republicans have endorsed it — Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, who introduced the bill with Golden, and bill cosponsor Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska  — though the bill has seven GOP co-sponsors out of its total 222.
“The House is now on recess until September, but Congressman Golden will continue working, in solidarity with the one million workers across the country whose collective bargaining rights were stripped by Trump’s executive order, to ensure the House takes action to restore workers’ rights,” his spokesperson said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Fitzpatrick did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Capital-Star. But, in a statement from when the bill was first introduced, he said, “Improving government efficiency is essential— but sweeping exclusions from collective bargaining are a blunt instrument that risk weakening the very stability and performance we aim to strengthen.”
Trump’s executive order on March 27 banned collective bargaining agreements at government agencies with “national security interests.” These include the Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Environmental Protection Agency, among numerous others, overall impacting about two-thirds of the federal workforce.
The White House said in a fact sheet that accompanied the order that “certain federal unions have declared war on President Trump’s agenda” and that the order was necessary to safeguard American interests.
A coalition of unions sued shortly after but, as of the latest decision issued last week, a federal appeals court allowed the Trump administration to proceed with implementing the executive order.
While the House is taking a break, union members will not be.
The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations plans to mobilize its members in the districts of representatives who have not signed the discharge petition, said Mia Jacobs, the union’s director of media relations.
That organizing across the country has already begun. On Monday, the group’s “Better in a Union” bus tour stop in Pittsburg concluded with a call to action for attendees to reach out to their members of Congress to sign the discharge petition.

“The collective bargaining executive order was the single biggest act of union busting in our history,” Jacobs said, “Union members understand the stakes of this, that if they can strip federal workers of their collective bargaining rights then the contracts for a million more workers are at risk, so this is something that is existential to the labor movement.”
While the discharge petition still needs more support, Jacobs said the current endorsements and the 222 bipartisan co-sponsors of the bill show the issue has broad support. This is also mostly true of the general public, as polls show about 70% of Americans approve of labor unions, cutting across party lines.

(Photo by Emily Elconin/Getty Images)Amid recent political rhetoric about rising crime and violence in American cities, a new analysis shows that violent crime has continued to decline this year.
Homicides and several other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, dropped during the first half of 2025 across 42 U.S. cities, continuing a downward trend that began in 2022, according to a new crime trends report released Thursday by the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
Homicides fell 17% in the first half of 2025, compared with the same period in 2024, among the 30 cities that reported homicide data, according to the report.
During that same period, five cities saw increases in homicide — ranging from 6% in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to 39% in Little Rock, Arkansas.
While the report’s authors say the continued drop in violent crime — especially homicides — is encouraging, they note that much of the decline stems from a few major cities with historically high rates, such as Baltimore and St. Louis.
More than half of the cities studied have higher homicide rates than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, though, the analysis found that there were 14% fewer homicides during the first half of 2025 compared to the same period in 2019.
The authors say more research is needed before crediting any specific policy or practice for the continued drop in violent crime.
The group’s findings come as President Donald Trump continues to amplify concerns about crime, at times citing misleading statistics and narratives.

In a Truth Social post earlier this week, Trump claimed that cashless bail — a practice that allows people charged with a crime to be released pretrial without paying money, unless a judge deems them a threat to public safety — were fueling a national crime surge and endangering law enforcement.
He wrote: “Crime in American Cities started to significantly rise when they went to CASHLESS BAIL. The WORST criminals are flooding our streets and endangering even our great law enforcement officers. It is a complete disaster, and must be ended, IMMEDIATELY!”
Some research suggests that setting money bail isn’t effective in ensuring court appearances or improving public safety. Opponents of ending cash bail often raise concerns that released suspects might commit new, potentially more serious crimes. While that is possible in individual cases, studies show that eliminating cash bail does not lead to a widespread increase in crime.
The Truth Social post also marked a sharp shift from Trump’s remarks during a June roundtable with the Fraternal Order of Police, where he claimed the national murder rate had “plummeted by 28%” since he took office — a figure that overstates the decline and overlooks the fact that murder rates began falling well before he returned to office.
According to data consulting firm AH Datalytics, which manages the Real-Time Crime Index — a free tool that collects crime data from more than 400 law enforcement agencies nationwide — the number of homicides between January and May 2025 was 20.3% lower than the same period in 2024.
Similarly, data released in May by the Major Cities Chiefs Association showed that homicides fell roughly 20% in the first quarter of 2025 compared with the first three months of the prior year. The group’s data is based on a survey of 68 major metropolitan police departments nationwide.
Researchers at the Council on Criminal Justice note in their report that it’s difficult to pinpoint a single reason for the drop in homicides, but they note that fewer people appear to be exposed to high-risk situations, such as robberies.
Most major crimes fell in the first half of 2025 compared with the same period last year, according to the council’s report.
Motor vehicle thefts dropped by 25%, while reported gun assaults fell 21%. Robberies, residential and non-residential burglaries, shoplifting, and aggravated and sexual assaults also saw double-digit declines
Drug offenses held steady, while domestic violence reports rose slightly — by about 3%. Carjackings declined 24% and larcenies were down 5%.
Compared with the first half of 2019, before the pandemic and nationwide reckoning over racial justice and policing, overall homicides are down 14%, robberies by 30%, and sexual assaults by 28%.
Still, more than 60% of the cities in the council’s study sample report homicide rates that remain above 2019 levels.
Motor vehicle theft remains the only crime tracked in the report that is still elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels — up 25% since 2019 — although it has declined sharply since 2023.
The council also released another analysis on the lethality of violent crime, showing that while violent incidents have decreased, the share of violence that ends in death has increased significantly. In 1994, there were 2 homicides per 1,000 assaults and about 16 per 1,000 robberies. By 2020, those figures rose to 7.2 and 55.8, respectively.

A barrier island restoration project damaged during the 2020 hurricane season will make a comeback with a fresh delivery of sand from the Outer Continental Shelf. 
Coastal Restoration and Protection Authority officials announced Thursday that the West Belle Headland, originally part of the larger beach and barrier island restoration project in Terrebonne Basin, will be revamped with nearly 4 million cubic yards of fresh sand. 
West Belle Headland was nearly done when Hurricane Zeta hit in October 2020. Nearly 75% of the newly laid sand and sediment washed away with the storm and severely damaged the project, which provides high-quality nesting habitat for birds as well as storm and flood protection for lower Lafourche Parish.
This time, the restoration plan is slightly different from the original. It will be constructed with sand dredged from federal waters instead of from a mixed sediment source nearby. Pure sand is a better restoration tool for Louisiana’s barrier islands, according to the CPRA news release.
“When a powerful storm like Hurricane Zeta makes a direct impact on a project site, we sometimes have to go back to the drawing board to ensure we are building the strongest, most sustainable project for the environment and elements,” CPRA executive director Michael Hare said in the release.
The Louisiana agency partnered with the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to provide the sand needed for the restoration from two borrow sites on Ship Shoal, a submerged barrier island about 9 miles from East Island off the coast of Terrebonne Parish. The federal bureau uses dredged sand, shell and gravel from federal waters on the Outer Continental Shelf for a variety of coastal restoration projects through the Marine Minerals Program. 
Because West Belle Headland was damaged in a hurricane, CPRA is also looking to use money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Public Assistance program to finish the project. FEMA funded about $720,000 so far for design and environmental impact review, and is now reviewing the final plans from CPRA to decide whether it will provide more money for construction. 
A decision is expected later this year, and CPRA plans to put the project up for bid in the fall.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-2.43.15-PM-1024x538.png,,,2025-07-24 15:56:47.022917

Tony Evers announced he will not seek a third term in office Thursday — triggering a competitive Democratic primary ahead of the 2026 general election to fill the office.
In a two-minute video posted to social media, Evers said that he wouldn’t be running for reelection despite being sure he could win a third term, because he wants to spend more time with his family.
“I began my run for governor as a proud Plymouth Progressive, and that’s still who I am today. I’m a science teacher at heart who ended up running for office and winning five straight statewide elections,” Evers said. “So, would I win if I ran a sixth time? Of course. No question about that. But whether I’d win or not has never been part of my calculus about running again.”
“Here’s the truth: Wisconsin, the only thing I love more than being your governor is being a husband, a dad, and a grandpa. I’ve spent 50 years in public service. I’m damn proud I devoted my entire career — and most of my life — to working for you. And from Plymouth to Baraboo, Tomah to Oshkosh, Verona to Madison, and everywhere in between, Kathy and my family supported me all the way,” Evers said. “For five decades, my family has sacrificed to give me the gift of service. They’re my world. And I owe it to them to focus on doing all the things we enjoy and love doing together. It’s why, Wisconsin, I’m announcing that I will not be running for a third term.”
Evers had said he would make a decision following the end of the budget cycle, and after he signed the new budget in early July, public debate about whether Evers should run began picking up steam. Some Democrats, including Rep. Mark Pocan and newly-elected Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Devin Remiker, expressed their hopes that Evers would run. Some Democratic state lawmakers expressed opposition to a third Evers term. .
Evers was first elected to the office in 2018, ousting Republican former Gov. Scott Walker in a close election and placing a Democrat in office for the first time in eight years. Weeks before he entered office Republican lawmakers sought to strip him of some of his executive powers before he even took office.
Prior to his governorship, Evers served as the Superintendent of Public Instruction from 2009-2019 and was known for his advocacy for public education.
Two Republican candidates, Washington Co. Executive Josh Schoemann and Whitefish Bay businessman Bill Berrien, have already launched their campaigns. Other Republicans are still considering whether to run, including U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The University of Iowa is working to bind its writing centers, programs and initiatives closer together with a new office.
The UI announced online Thursday its launch of the Office of Writing and Communication, which will serve as a “strategic hub” and support system for the university’s writing programs.
Executive Vice President and Provost Kevin Kregel said in the release those involved in the university’s various writing programs “expressed strong interest” in forming the office, and their perspectives and feedback helped shape it.
A committee made up of UI community members worked with almost all writing and communication groups over the course of a year, according to the release, gathering information on the strengths and challenges of each one. The group recommended a centralized office that could provide consistent messaging, academic and professional development to students, as well as bring closer together the various writing centers across campus and support their work.

“The feedback was clear and consistent,” said Andre Perry, committee member and executive director of Hancher Auditorium and the Office of Performing Arts, in the release. “Faculty and staff said they saw tremendous potential in a central office that could support collaboration, amplify our shared impact, and enhance the student experience across the board.”
The UI Office of the Provost will house the new office, the release stated. Hiring will begin before the start of the 2025-2026 academic year with an executive director, according to the release, who will focus on campus engagement and strategic planning in the office’s first year.
Kregel said in the release the executive director will coordinate initiatives and other work across the different writing departments, which “will build a collaborative foundation that strengthens and sustains Iowa’s leadership in writing and communication.”
Writing programs at the UI span undergraduate and graduate, fiction and nonfiction and various specific fields, including medical writing, playwriting and journalism. It also offers programs in Spanish creative writing, translation, and initiatives focused on international authors and youth writers.
“Writing and communication are at the core of what we do and who we are,” Kregel said in the release. “This new office reflects our commitment to investing in excellence, fostering collaboration, and advancing innovative programming that prepares our students for success.”

A year ago, the state’s “housing wage” was $25.21 per hour.
The NLIHC releases an annual report — Out of Reach: The High Cost of Housing — which shows what people must earn to afford rents. The “housing wage” is an estimate of what a full-time worker must earn to afford rent at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Fair Market Rent (FMR) without spending more than 30% of their income.
Individuals and families that spend more than 30% of income on housing are considered cost burdened. Nearly half — 48% — of the state’s renters and 19% of homeowners are considered cost burdened, according to the N.C. Housing Coalition.
At $27.14 per hour, North Carolina has the 30th highest housing wage in the nation. A worker earning the $7.25 per hour minimum wage must work 150 per week to afford a modest two-bedroom apartment. An annual income of $56,442 is needed to afford a two-bedroom home at the $1,232 per month FMR.

“This report is a critical reminder that we cannot reduce the affordable housing crisis down to individual choice or supply alone,” Stephanie Watkins-Cruz, director of housing policy for the N.C. Housing Coalition, said in a statement. “This report reminds us that wages are not keeping up with the cost of living and that more and more North Carolinians are experiencing the strain of cost-burden across our state.”
Meanwhile, the national 2025 “housing wage is $33.63 per hour for a two-bedroom rental home and $28.17 for a one-bedroom rental home. Last year, the national “housing wage” was $32.11 per hour for a two-bedroom rental. It was $26.74 for a one-bedroom rental.

“Housing is more than just shelter, it is foundational to well-being and dignity,” said NLIHC President and CEO Renee Willis. “This year’s Out of Reach report shows that, despite economic gains for some, low-income renters continue to face impossible choices between paying rent and meeting basic needs.”
Willis said the report findings reinforce the conclusion that cutting federal housing investments would only deepen the housing crisis.
“Congress must protect and expand housing programs that ensure stability, opportunity, and a pathway out of poverty for millions of renters,” Willis said.
California has the highest housing wage at $49.61 per hour. A worker there must clock 120 hours per week to afford a two-bedroom apartment at the state minimum wage of $16.50 per hour. An annual income of $103,184 is needed to afford a two-bedroom home at the FMR of $2,580 per month.
The report’s authors noted that California is one of 30 states across the nation, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and 64 local governments that have minimum wages above the $7.25 per hour federal minimum wage. Those wages range for $8.75 per hour in West Virginia to $17.50 per hour in the District of Columbia.
“Yet even in areas with higher minimum wages, the reality remains grim: nowhere in the United States—no state, metropolitan area, or county—can a full-time minimum-wage worker afford a modest two-bedroom rental home at Fair Market Rent,” the authors wrote in the report’s introduction.
They noted that the outlook for one-bedroom homes is only slightly better with just 7% of counties nationwide — 219 out of more than 3,000, excluding Puerto Rico — have a one-bedroom Fair Market Rent that is affordable for a full-time minimum-wage worker.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Image-2-1024x502.jpeg,,,2025-07-24 15:56:47.022917

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)A new Louisiana legislative task force on name, image and likeness issues is formulating a plan to tackle the problems the burgeoning industry has brought amid a time of turmoil for college athletics. 
The study committee was created in House Resolution 15 by Rep. Rashid Young, D-Homer, a former Grambling State football player who will chair the task force. Made up of athletics directors, business leaders and college athletes, the group is tasked with making recommendations for future state laws on NIL and athlete compensation. 
Only within the past four years have college athletes been permitted to profit off of their name, image and likeness. NCAA rules adopted in 2021 allowed them to strike endorsement contracts like their professional counterparts, ranging from small-dollar deals with local businesses to multi-million dollar agreements with large corporations. 
While many have celebrated the new rules, which allowed unpaid athletes the ability to access some of the profit being made off college sports, others believe the influx of money has opened the floodgate to NIL deals that essentially amounted to paying players for their performance on the field, which is not permitted. 
This summer, a federal judge approved a settlement in the case House v. NCAA that will allow schools to pay their student-athletes directly. While the new payment mechanism is called “revenue sharing,” many colleges that do not make a profit with their athletics program will still pay their players to maintain a competitive advantage. 
At the first meeting of Young’s task force Thursday, members expressed frustrations with the new reality of college athletics. 
“I’ve seen so many changes through the years with the NCAA and how they have allowed this to get out of control, and now we have to try to put it back to some reasonableness,” John Curtis Christian High School football coach J.T. Curtis said. 
Along with the ability to pay players, the House ruling resulted in the creation of the College Sports Commission, a private oversight organization to which athletes must submit their NIL deals for approval. 
Taylor Jacobs, LSU’s associate athletic director of NIL & strategic initiatives and one of the university’s representatives on the task force, said the new reporting system has not been easy and has delayed approval of some deals. Requests filed in the days after LSU won the College World Series on June 22 still have not been approved by the commission, she said. Because interest in deals spike after a national championship, those athletes may have missed their window of opportunity, Jacobs explained. 
Whether colleges can find a way to legally compensate international athletes without jeopardizing their visa status is another issue facing colleges in Louisiana and elsewhere. Young said the problem might require seeking partners in the federal government to solve. 
The task force comes after two bills to exempt college athlete’s NIL income from state taxes stalled in the state legislature earlier this year. The proposals created perception concerns as legislators were being asked to tighten state spending. 
Young’s House Bill 168 would have exempted the first $12,500 of student-athletes’ NIL income from state taxes. It would have aligned the exemption with the standardized deduction offered to every other Louisiana resident. It’s not clear if this legislation is necessary for the athletes to receive the deduction, but Young said he wanted to make sure they get it. 
House Bill 166 by Rep. Dixon McMakin, R-Baton Rouge, would have exempted the entirety of an athlete’s NIL income from state taxes. The task force is likely to recommend a version of this bill. 
Its recommendations are likely to cover more than just college athletics. Two members representing high schools expressed concern that state law does not regulate how their athletes can be compensated for their name, image and likeness. 
Young said legislation will probably be filed to protect children who engage in these deals. 
The task force is expected to meet monthly until it submits its report to the legislature in January. The next regular session starts in March 2026.
Members of the task force include: 

State Rep. Rashid Young, D-Homer
Taylor Jacobs, LSU associate athletic director of NIL & strategic initiatives

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.

The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.










The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling.


– Oregon Republican state Rep. Cyrus Javadi


Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.

Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.

Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

The training, held Tuesday, comes nearly two months after Connecticut legislators once again ended a legislative session without imposing AI regulation for businesses.
Meta, owner of Meta AI, first rolled out the training events for businesses in its headquarters state of California, where private sector regulatory laws for AI exist. The event in Hartford, however, was Meta’s first AI training venture in the northeast.
Across Connecticut, companies use AI for a wide range of purposes, from health care monitoring and contract review to technological support and typing up job descriptions. While AI is unregulated for businesses in Connecticut, some businesses have been wary to fully implement its use.
According to CBIA’s 2025 survey of CT businesses, nearly three-quarters of respondents were interested in using AI technology for their business, but did not know how to move ahead with it. During the training, participants learned prompt-engineering, effective communication of brand tone with AI and evaluated the specific uses of AI in their operations. 
“[AI] is an essential tool for any business to be able to adapt and sustain in the future, and it is an essential tool for a workforce,” said Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam at the event.

Interested, but unsure
Jason Howie, CEO of AVNA, a medical manufacturing company based in New Britain, said that their business uses AI for contract reviews, drafting job descriptions and assistance for certain engineering problems.
Jacqueline Wetherell, director of workforce development & continuing education at CT State Quinebaug Valley, said that Connecticut State Colleges and Universities continue to provide AI certification to students, under a federal workforce training grant that aims to “close equity gaps.” 
West Hartford Chamber of Commerce’s CEO Christopher Conway and Kate Kobs, the chamber’s director of development and programs, said AI helps them brainstorm and process internal data. For example, Kobs said, AI helped her code the interface for their website, despite her lack of coding experience.
“We’re working with all of the major corporations in the city and all the colleges across the state of Connecticut,” Arulampalam said, pointing to the Connecticut AI Alliance, a coalition of 16 universities across the state focusing on AI-oriented research, workforce training, and educational programs.
Last year, the Department of Economic and Community Development announced “Innovation Clusters,” $100 million in grant funding for innovative startups, including quantum computing and AI hubs. 
Arulampalam pointed to Jeff Auker, Hartford’s director of development services, who is working on plans that would make the capital city an AI hub by establishing an applied AI center near Dunkin’ Park. The center’s costs are estimated at $90 million and developers will vie for nearly half of “Innovation Clusters” funds. 
Decisions for grant finalists are yet to be announced. 
AI legislation
In this year’s legislative session, lawmakers criminalized AI generated revenge deepfake pornography and secured funding for AI education. However, Gov. Ned Lamont, under threats of a veto, stopped a bill that would have regulated AI use for businesses from being called to a vote in the House, although it passed through the Senate with much support. 
Senate Bill 2 would have required companies to disclose AI use, document their processes, perform risk assessments and protect consumers from discrimination. Proponents of the bill cited the risk of AI’s bias in evaluating housing, credit and job applications. The legislation sought to regulate AI, not to stymie its use or development, according to Sen. James Maroney, D-Milford, who has long championed AI regulation by sponsoring legislation and co-chairing a statewide joint taskforce on the issue.
Lamont voiced concern that regulatory legislation could impede on business development and investment across the state. Other opponents of the bill argued that piecemeal legislation would be confusing and questioned Connecticut’s commitment to being among the first states to regulate AI for businesses.
Nationwide regulation still vary, with Colorado and Utah among the states to pass AI regulatory legislation for businesses. 
The Trump administration also criminalised AI generated deepfake pornography in May. The original version of the “One Big Beautiful Bill” contained language that banned states from enacting and enforcing their own AI regulation laws for 10 years. In a 99-1 Senate vote, however, the language was removed and states can still chart their own regulation laws for AI. 
David Steuber, chief of staff for the Department of Economic and Community Development, pointed to the benefits of harnessing new technology.
“There are good reasons to be concerned about the future, but I think that the thing we should try to do is to really lean into this new technology, make the most of it and see how we can leverage it in our daily, personal, and our business lives,” he said. 
Chris Davis, CBIA’s vice president of public policy, thanked Meta for “targeting us and having us be the first one [event] on the East Coast.

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)A recent proclamation from President Donald Trump will allow 25 chemical manufacturers, including 12 with sites in Louisiana, to ignore new federal rules meant to contain harmful emissions.
A week ago, Trump issued what the White House labeled “regulatory relief for certain stationary sources to promote American chemical manufacturing security.” His action applies to regulations the Environmental Protection Agency published in May, called the Hazardous Organic National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants – or the HON rule for short.   
“The HON Rule imposes substantial burdens on chemical manufacturers already operating under stringent regulations,” Trump said in his proclamation. “Many of the testing and monitoring requirements outlined in the HON Rule rely on technologies that are not practically available, not demonstrated at the necessary scale, or cannot be implemented safely or consistently under real-world conditions.”
The Louisiana facilities now exempt from the HON Rule include:

Shell Chemical, Geismar plant
Dow Chemical Co. Glycol II plant, Plaquemine 
Formosa Plastics, Baton Rouge
Union Carbide/Dow Chemical, Hahnville
Westlake Vinyl, Westlake
BASF Corp., Geismar
Rubicon, Geismar
Citgo Petroleum, Lake Charles
TotalEnergies Polystyrene, Carville
Denka Performance Elastomers, LaPlace
Sasol Chemicals, Lake Charles
DuPont Specialty Products, LaPlace

Anne Rolfes, director of the environmental group Louisiana Bucket Brigade, said Trump’s proclamation is based on the false claim that there is already strict government oversight of chemical facilities.
“The HON rule was a reasonable step toward controlling the pollution that is making us all sick. If anything, it didn’t go far enough,” Rolfes said. “Our congressional delegation should be up in arms about the White House rollback, but instead they are doing as they have always done: serving the needs of the chemical industry instead of the health and safety of the people. It continues to be up to us – to ordinary people in Louisiana – to protect ourselves from this industry.” 
Many of the facilities on Trump’s HON rule exclusion list have a history of environmental concerns, with Denka Performance Elastomers arguably having the highest profile.
In February 2023, the EPA and U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the company, alleging its neoprene operations “present an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and welfare” for the cancer risks its chloroprene emissions pose.
The Biden administration demanded Denka reduce emissions of chloroprene and ethylene oxide, another carcinogen, at its LaPlace plant. The EPA gave Denka 90 days to bring down its toxic emission levels, compared with two years for facilities in other parts of the country.
Gov. Jeff Landry accused the federal agency of trying to shut down the Denka site.
Within weeks of Trump returning to the White House, the Justice Department had the EPA lawsuit dismissed. 
In September, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality reported a chloroprene leak at the Denka plant that forced it to halt operations. The EPA has identified five census tracts in the LaPlace area as having the highest exposure to chloroprene in the nation — all attributed to the Denka plant.
Other incidents at the exempted chemical plants have also made the news.
A  July 2023 explosion at Dow Chemical’s glycol plant in Plaquemine produced a fire that burned for nearly two days before being brought under control. The same facility saw a string of emergencies dating back to 2019. The unit involved in the explosion two years ago was involved in four previous unauthorized releases of ethylene glycol, according to state records. The toxic compound is highly flammable and can cause kidney damage from prolonged exposure.
In January 2022, an explosion at the Westlake Chemical complex in Calcasieu Parish injured six people and forced nearby schools to place students under lockdown until a dark cloud of smoke over the Lake Charles area cleared. Federal records show the plant has an extensive history of spills, accidents and injured workers. 
Before Trump returned to office, the EPA pursued financial sanctions against facilities that violated its safety and environmental regulations. The agency reached a $1.4 million settlement early last year with Sasol Chemicals for an “alleged accident” in October 2022 that resulted in a fire that burned 8 tons of triethyl aluminum, a catalyst used to make synthetic materials and jet fuel. 
Trump’s EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, has argued the agency is authorized – but not mandated – to enforce the Clean Air Act, based on a 2007 U.S. Supreme Court ruling. 
Zeldin also wants to walk back the Endangerment Finding, a 2009 EPA declaration that  greenhouse gases and certain pollutants pose a public health risk. The finding gave the agency more power to enforce environmental regulations.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Dow4-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-24 15:56:47.022917

Mike Braun said on Thursday he thought the American public deserved “full transparency” when it came to files related to the death of the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, who died in custody while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

Mike Braun called for ""full transparency"" on the Jeffrey Epstein files from the Indiana Statehouse on July 24, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Gov. Mike Braun said on Thursday he thought the American public deserved “full transparency” when it came to files related to the death of the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, who died in custody while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Speaking from the Statehouse, Braun also touched on immigration.
“I think the (U.S. House) Speaker (Mike Johnson) and the Trump administration are out there now where they’re for it, fully,” said Braun, a former member of the U.S. Senate. “I think they kind of were all along. It begs the question, why wasn’t that done in the prior four years?”
Epstein died in 2019, during the first term of President Donald Trump, who had a long friendship with the convicted sex offender — as did former President Bill Clinton. Recent reporting from several sources indicates that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has told Trump he’s in those files. Recently, Trump moved to release grand jury testimony but a judge denied that motion.

The U.S. House adjourned early this week to avoid a vote on releasing the files after House Democrats made repeated efforts to get Republicans on-the-record.
“Now it seems like it’s got a heavy political overtone to it, but I’m for full transparency,” Braun said in a media gaggle back in Indianapolis. “I think we’re going to get it. I think the American public deserves it; we’ll wait and see.” 
Chatting for just over 15 minutes, Braun also praised Trump for his larger approach to immigration and border security — compliments that come shortly after the federal government revealed it will house immigrants at Camp Atterbury in southern Indiana. Details about when Immigration and Customs Enforcement might use the base aren’t yet finalized.
“I wouldn’t entertain it unless (humane treatment) was the case,” he said in response to a question. Some immigrants held at a Florida facility have alleged inhumane and unsanitary conditions, though the camps aren’t usually accessible to the general public.
“I’ve been clear: I’m for helping remove criminals after they came in here illegally, and some of the egregious ones we’d all agree with,” Braun said. “… Here in our state, we’re going to do what I said I’d do from the get-go: the worst, first, and going after ones that broke the law once they came into the country illegally. And that’s to the extent that I’m going to be willing to help.” 
A Thursday story from Axios Indianapolis reported that, in June, one-quarter of people arrested by ICE in Indiana had no criminal background — undermining Braun’s emphasis on only arresting those with a record. 
“If that data is correct, I’d say that should raise eyebrows,” Braun said. “Because I’ve been clearly on record: the worst, first. And there are many of them out there.”

(Courtesy of Mesilla Valley Search and Rescue) Flash floods from heavy rains Tuesday evening in Vado required the rescue of at least 20 people, while power outages impacted about 600 homes, local officials said.
Officials reported no fatalities so far, but two people required transport to local hospitals for minor injuries, Ariana Parra, the public safety spokesperson for Doña Ana County, told Source NM, adding that their status is unknown.
On Thursday, as people try to assess the damages to at least 110 flooded homes, the Doña Ana County Commission is slated to convene an emergency meeting at 4 p.m. to consider sending a request for a disaster declaration to the governor’s office.
New Mexico has been hard-hit by flooding this monsoon season. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump freed up more funding in an ongoing federal disaster declaration after deadly flooding in Ruidoso around the burn scars of 2024 fires. The state has outstanding requests to the federal government to provide funds for flooding damages in Chaves, Otero and Valencia counties.
Between 2 to 3 inches of rain from monsoons fell in and around the community of 3,400 people, which lies about 18 miles south of Las Cruces on the Rio Grande, with water breaching the banks of the arroyos.
“There was a lot of rain, I don’t know how to put it any other way,” John Gwynne, the flood commissioner for Doña Ana County, told Source NM. “There was a lot of rain that came out of the desert and carried with it debris and sediment and that’s just everywhere, now.”
Gwynne said the issue is getting the standing water out, since the debris is clogging up drainage, and addressing any repairs needed for the flood infrastructure.
“There’s so much water inside, it’s even hard to understand what the damages are at this point,” Gwynne said.
Rep. Doreen Gallegos (D-Las Cruces), whose district includes Vado, told Source NM in a phone call that she’s in contact with county commissioners and praised the first responders and rescue officials for their response.
“They were going house to house to make sure people were safe, and I’m very, very grateful for that,” she said.
Significant moisture built up in and around Vado, and heavy rains fell in the desert and drained towards the town, Tom Bird, a senior forecaster at the National Weather Service office in Santa Teresa, told Source NM.
The NWS El Paso issued alerts to people’s phones at 6:21 p.m., warning of the flash floods in Vado, and three minutes later for the nearby communities of Chamberino and Berino.
Forecasts indicate the area will dry up in the next few days, but may experience more rain Sunday and Monday.
“On Friday, Saturday, flooding potential really drops off, but then the monsoon moisture moves right back in, starting Sunday into next week. And so we’ll ramp up the potential for flooding again,” Bird said. “And, as a reminder, we’re in monsoon season all the way through September.”

(Photo by Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)Two ballot question committees on Thursday asked the court to block six Arkansas laws regulating direct democracy, one day after a federal judge granted them permission to intervene in an existing lawsuit. 
The original suit, brought by the League of Women Voters of Arkansas, challenges the constitutionality of state laws governing the petition and referendum process. The League also is gathering signatures to qualify its proposed ballot measure for the 2026 ballot. 
The League and Protect AR Rights, one of two ballot question committees intervening in the suit, are both pursuing ballot measures aimed at protecting Arkansans’ right to direct democracy. 
Direct democracy is the process by which Arkansans can propose new laws or constitutional amendments and place them on the ballot for a statewide vote. Arkansas is one of 24 states that allow citizen-led initiatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids, a ballot question committee pursuing an education-related ballot measure, filed a complaint, motion for preliminary injunction and brief in support of the motion Thursday. The coalitions requested a hearing on the motion, a preliminary injunction to block the laws and an order requiring the secretary of state to count and verify any otherwise legally valid signatures that don’t comply with the challenged laws. 
The laws the groups are asking a judge to block are: 

Act 218 of 2025, which requires signature gatherers (canvassers) to inform potential signers that petition fraud is a criminal offense.
Act 240 of 2025, which requires canvassers to request a photo ID from potential signers.
Act 274 of 2025, which requires potential signers to read a petition’s ballot title or have it read to them; failure to ensure this would result in a misdemeanor charge against the canvasser.
Act 602 of 2025, which prohibits ballot titles from being written above an eighth-grade reading level.
Act 236 of 2023, which requires petition signatures be gathered from 50 counties (up from 15 counties). 
Ark. Code Ann. § 7-9- 601(a)(2)(C), which requires a ballot initiative sponsor to provide the secretary of state the name and address of paid canvassers before they solicit any signatures; and the associated Ark. Code Ann. § 7-9-126(b)(4), which provides that, if the sponsor fails to provide this information, the signatures the paid canvasser collected won’t count.  

Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids argue in their 56-page complaint that the state laws infringe on their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. 
Some of the laws challenged by the coalitions are the same ones challenged in the League’s original suit, including the one that criminalizes a canvasser’s failure to have potential signers read the ballot title.
For AR Kids failed to collect sufficient signatures to qualify for the 2024 ballot, but is working to make it on the 2026 ballot. The attorney general approved For AR Kids’ ballot title in February, which allows the group to begin collecting signatures. 
The coalition argued in Thursday’s court documents that the new state laws reduce the amount of signatures canvassers can collect in a given period because it takes longer to comply with all the regulations. Additionally, the laws have made it more difficult to recruit people to collect signatures.
Judge allows groups to intervene in lawsuit challenging Arkansas direct democracy laws

“Since the Attorney General approved its 2026 ballot measure, For AR Kids has contacted over eighty previous volunteers from more than thirty counties to gauge their interest in collecting signatures for the 2026 initiative campaign,” the complaint states. “Many canvassers indicated that they did not intend to participate this cycle and cited the new laws as a reason.”
For AR Kids and Protect AR Rights are also challenging laws not included in the League’s suit, including one prohibiting ballot titles from being written above an eighth-grade reading level. The ranking is determined by the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level formula, a test that uses word complexity and sentence lengths to calculate what grade of education is needed to comprehend written material.  
Protect AR Rights’ ballot measure has been rejected twice for failing to meet this requirement. The coalition argued in court filings it can’t comply with the law while also satisfying “preexisting content requirements for ballot titles.”
Attempting to comply with the reading-level law forces the coalition “to select language to game a mechanical test” instead of selecting language to convey its preferred message with voters, the complaint states. Protect AR Rights also asserts that the reading-level requirement can’t be met “without omitting essential facts” needed for certification and to inform voters about “the political change that the measure proposes.” 
“By making it far more difficult, if not impossible, to gain the Attorney General’s approval for an initiated measure, the Reading-Level Requirement impedes Protect AR Rights’ ability to engage voters about political change and to present its measure to the voters at an election,” the complaint states.
For AR Kids’ measure was approved in February before the new law took effect in April. The League’s measure satisfied the reading-level requirement when it was certified in May.
Protect AR Rights submitted the third version of its proposal to the attorney general’s office earlier this month, and the deadline for him to reject or certify the submission is July 29.

Stephen Fowler/GPB NewsKelvin King, a former Republican candidate for U.S. Senate and husband of State Election Board member Janelle King, has launched a bid for secretary of state, joining state Rep. Tim Fleming in the race to become Georgia’s next top elections officer.
In an op-ed announcing his candidacy, King emphasized the need to restore voter confidence in Georgia, citing concerns often raised by right-wing election activists about the security of voting machines and accuracy of the state’s voter rolls. He also promised to fire government employees who “attack political candidates or supporters,” though he did not include any specific examples of government employee misconduct.
“A Kelvin King candidacy is rooted in service, business experience, and a commitment to truth,” he wrote. “I’m not here to play politics. I’m here to build bridges, restore trust and secure elections that are fair, efficient, and transparent for every Georgian.”
A contractor and Air Force veteran based in Sandy Springs, King also serves as the chair of Let’s Win for America Action, a political action committee that raises funds for conservative candidates. He last ran for office in 2022, finishing second to last in a six-way Republican U.S. Senate primary. The winner, Herschel Walker, lost in a runoff election to Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock.
So far, King and Fleming are the only two Republicans in the race. No Democratic contenders have announced their candidacy, and Republican Brad Raffensperger, the current secretary of state, has not announced his plans for 2026.

Tony Evers announced Thursday he will not seek a third term. | Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin Democratic Gov. Tony Evers announced he will not seek a third term in office Thursday — triggering a competitive Democratic primary ahead of the 2026 general election to fill the office.
In a two-minute video posted to social media, Evers said that he wouldn’t be running for reelection despite being sure he could win a third term, because he wants to spend more time with his family.
“I began my run for governor as a proud Plymouth Progressive, and that’s still who I am today. I’m a science teacher at heart who ended up running for office and winning five straight statewide elections,” Evers said. “So, would I win if I ran a sixth time? Of course. No question about that. But whether I’d win or not has never been part of my calculus about running again.”
“Here’s the truth: Wisconsin, the only thing I love more than being your governor is being a husband, a dad, and a grandpa. I’ve spent 50 years in public service. I’m damn proud I devoted my entire career — and most of my life — to working for you. And from Plymouth to Baraboo, Tomah to Oshkosh, Verona to Madison, and everywhere in between, Kathy and my family supported me all the way,” Evers said. “For five decades, my family has sacrificed to give me the gift of service. They’re my world. And I owe it to them to focus on doing all the things we enjoy and love doing together. It’s why, Wisconsin, I’m announcing that I will not be running for a third term.”
Evers had said he would make a decision following the end of the budget cycle, and after he signed the new budget in early July, public debate about whether Evers should run began picking up steam. Some Democrats, including Rep. Mark Pocan and newly-elected Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Devin Remiker, expressed their hopes that Evers would run. Some Democratic state lawmakers expressed opposition to a third Evers term. .
Evers was first elected to the office in 2018, ousting Republican former Gov. Scott Walker in a close election and placing a Democrat in office for the first time in eight years. Weeks before he entered office Republican lawmakers sought to strip him of some of his executive powers before he even took office.
Prior to his governorship, Evers served as the Superintendent of Public Instruction from 2009-2019 and was known for his advocacy for public education.
Two Republican candidates, Washington Co. Executive Josh Schoemann and Whitefish Bay businessman Bill Berrien, have already launched their campaigns. Other Republicans are still considering whether to run, including U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany.

(Lori Kersey | West Virginia Watch)BECKLEY — Dealing another victory to Gov. Patrick Morrisey and his executive order, a Raleigh County judge on Thursday granted a preliminary injunction allowing three Raleigh County students to attend school with a religious exemption to the state’s strict compulsory school vaccination law. 
Circuit Judge Michael Froble ruled that the state’s mandatory school vaccine law is invalid without a religious exemption to the law. If there were any question, he said, the state’s Equal Protection for Religion Act of 2023 makes it clear the law should make exceptions for religious beliefs. 
The lawsuit was brought on behalf of Miranda Guzman, Amanda Tulley and Carley Hunter, whose children were issued a religious exemption to the school vaccine mandates by the state Department of Health.
Morrisey issued an executive order in January requiring the state to allow religious exemptions to its school vaccination laws. State lawmakers this year did not pass —— which would have established those exemptions in state code. 
The West Virginia school board voted not to comply with Morrisey’s executive order and to instruct county boards of education to require all vaccines and allow only medical exemptions to those vaccination requirements. 
“The court finds that only requiring school kids in the public school to have vaccinations, but not requiring adults and other people and having learning pods and having athletic activities that does occur really diminishes any kind of argument that compelling state interest in only making sure that children in the public school or attending public schools are receiving their mandatory vaccinations, and that they are disregarding their rights for exercising their religion,” Froble said.
Speaking for Guzman and the other plaintiffs, attorney Chris Weist argued that barring the students from attending school would violate the state’s Equal Protection for Religion Act and cause them irreparable harm.
“These plaintiffs are being forced to either give in to the state’s demands of vaccination, contrary to their religious beliefs, or not send their kids to school, which is a guarantee under the West Virginia Constitution for the West Virginia Supreme Court, a fundamental right.,” he said. “So I think we do have unquestionably a substantial burden on these plaintiffs’ religious exercise.”
Chris Smith, an attorney for the state Board of Education, said the governor’s reading of the Equal Protection Act is too broad. The Legislature is required to name bills according to what they do, he said. Lawmakers did not contemplate the Equal Protection for Religion Act amending the state’s school vaccination laws, he said. 
The judge’s ruling applies to only the three students bringing a lawsuit against the state and Raleigh County board of educations, but is likely to have broader implications. Froble said the next step in the case should be a hearing on a permanent injunction in the case, preferably set in the next 14 days. That hearing might not happen if parties in the case decide to file a written appeal, he said. 
Froble said he purposely didn’t take up the issue of whether Morrisey’s executive order is legally valid, though he said he would take it up at a future hearing on the permanent injunction. 
Speaking to reporters after the judge’s ruling, state School Board President Paul Hardesty said he was disappointed and said there is a lot to digest in the ruling with the rest of the school board. 
“For our counties that are now scratching their heads trying to figure out what to do, the department, as we speak, is working on putting out a statement to all 55 counties as well as the press, and we’ll have that by the close of business today,” he said. 
In a statement Thursday, Morrisey said the ruling is “another legal victory in the fight for religious freedom. 
Kanawha County Circuit Judge Kenneth Ballard on Wednesday dismissed on procedure grounds a separate lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice over Morrisey’s executive order. Ballard agreed with an attorney for the state that the ACLU failed to give the state 30-day notice of the legal action, as required by law. 
“No family should be forced to choose between their faith and their children’s education, which is exactly what the unelected bureaucrats on the State Board of Education are attempting to force West Virginians to do,” Morrisey said in his statement. “My administration will continue to grant religious exemptions to compulsory vaccine requirements and uphold West Virginia’s Equal Protection for Religion Act until this case is fully settled.”

We will do so through a transparent and common-sense process that preserves USDA’s critical health and public safety services the American public relies on.”U.S. Sen. Todd Young, an Indiana Republican, called the announcement “very exciting news for Hoosiers.”“Great to see these services move outside of DC and into places like Indiana that feed our nation,” he wrote on X.Pay ratesThe USDA release also appealed to the plan’s cost efficiencies. By moving workers out of the expensive Washington, D.C. area, the department would avoid the extra pay workers in the region are entitled to, the department said.Federal workers are eligible for increased pay based on the cost of living in the city in which they’re employed.Washington has among the highest rates, boosting pay for workers in that region by 33%. Other than Fort Collins, whose workers also earn more than 30% more than their base pay, the other hub cities range from 17% in Salt Lake City to 22% in Raleigh, according to the release.The plan includes vacating several D.C.-area office buildings that are overdue for large maintenance projects, the department said.The department plans to retain its presence at the Jamie L. Whitten Federal Building and Yates Building, both in D.C., and the National Agricultural Library in Beltsville, Maryland.It will vacate the South Building in D.C., Braddock Place in Alexandria, Virginia, and Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Maryland. The George Washington Carver Center in Beltsville will serve as an additional office location during the reorganization, but will also be sold or transferred once the reorganization is complete, the memo said.Each of USDA’s mission areas will still have a presence in the nation’s capital, according to the release.But the plan includes consolidating several functions into regional offices in an effort to “eliminate management layers and bureaucracy,” according to the memo.Forest ServiceThe U.S. Forest Service, a key USDA agency, will phase out its nine regional offices primarily into a single location in Fort Collins. The agency will retain a small state office in Alaska and an Eastern office in Athens, Georgia, according to the memo.The Agriculture Research Service will also consolidate from 12 offices to the five regional hubs.And a series of support functions would be centralized, according to the memo.",,,,2025-07-24 14:56:44.454413

The state’s teachers’ expenses are nearly on par with those in Pennsylvania, which topped the list at $1,637.
This is also an increase from last year, when North Carolina teachers spent about $1,300 of their own money on school supplies, and ranked as the fourth highest in the country for out-of-pocket expenses.
Nationwide, teachers shelled out an average of $1,021 this year, a 12% jump from 2024’s figure of $915.
Arizona and Texas also saw substantial teacher spending, at $1,581 and $1,550 respectively, while Nebraska reported the lowest at a still significant $473, according to the survey.
The survey, conducted this month, shows increases across nearly all metrics. It comes as reports show teachers earn 73 cents for every dollar made by similarly educated professionals, according to the Economic Policy Institute.
Teachers nationwide expect to spend 12% more on classroom supplies compared to last year, according to the report. These rising costs are adding financial pressure on teachers already stretched thin. In North Carolina, the average teacher salary for the 2023-24 school year was $58,292, placing the state 43rd nationally, according to the National Education Association’s report released in April 2025. This figure is nearly $14,000 below the national average of $72,030. The state also ranks 37th in the nation for per-student-spending.
Teachers are spending more than ever to outfit their classrooms, with many covering costs that go well beyond pencils and paper. According to the survey, 98% of educators nationwide report buying consumable supplies out of pocket, while 80% purchase classroom decor and 72% invest in educational aids such as books and games. More than a third also pay for snacks, cleaning products or first aid supplies.
A large majority of educators, 82%, said their classroom’s learning environment would suffer if they didn’t use their own money to purchase school supplies. 
Parents across the country are also bracing for higher expenses. They expect to spend an average of $774 per child on back-to-school necessities this year, a 10% increase over 2024. 
The survey included responses from 2,500 teachers and 2,500 parents of school-aged children, with each group drawing 50 participants from each state.
Key takeaways from the CouponBird study:

Teachers now average $1,021 in annual out-of-pocket classroom spending, up 12% from 2024’s already hefty $915.
Pennsylvania teachers top the list at $1,637 out of pocket, while Nebraska educators spend the least at $473.
Thirty percent of teachers work second jobs to afford classroom expenses, up from 26% in 2024.
Parents expect to spend an average of $774 per child on back-to-school necessities, a 10% jump from 2024.
Thirty percent of teachers and 31% of parents pick up a second job or side hustle to cover costs, both up from last year’s reported 26% for teachers and 28% for parents",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/School-supplies-wish-list.jpg,,,2025-07-24 14:56:44.454413

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A member of the Oklahoma State Board of Education on Thursday questioned why an agency official’s resignation letter addressed to the board was never provided to her. 
Becky Carson asked state Superintendent Ryan Walters why the letter, which contains accusations of “fundamental operational issues” within the agency, was never sent to the panel, despite being addressed to both the Republican leader and the state governing board. 
Chief Compliance Officer Kourtney Heard’s resignation letter, obtained by Oklahoma Voice, alleges that significant challenges, including “manipulation of school accreditation,” are hindering the Education Department from achieving better outcomes for students. Heard resigned from the agency on April 4. 
“In the media, in her resignation letter it says it’s addressed to you as the superintendent, but also to the school board and we did not receive that letter,” Carson said. “So as a board, we want to ensure that we’re receiving all correspondence, including resignations, at least the ones that are addressed to us.”
She said she’s not interested in Heard’s personal information or reasoning for leaving the agency, just why the board didn’t receive correspondence addressed to it. 
Oklahoma Voice received Heard’s letter from another former agency employee and independently confirmed its authenticity. Education officials have denied open records requests seeking release of the letter. The letter is the subject of an open records lawsuit from another media outlet, Oklahoma Watch.
Heard wrote that the agency needs to address “fundamental operational issues” and “senior leadership attitudes.” She wrote that she witnessed the barriers to progress firsthand, including “manipulation of school accreditation and deleting of employee review processes.”
The state Department of Education denied open records requests from Oklahoma Voice asking for several letters of resignation. Court filings in the lawsuit with Oklahoma Watch show the agency contends that providing the records would violate employee privacy and cited a section of the state Open Records Act that permits public bodies to keep resignation documents confidential if they pertain to an internal personnel investigation.
The Education Department has refused to confirm if such an investigation exists. 
Walters said he is aware of the letter being referenced and said he would look into the issue.  
“Fake news puts a lot of garbage out there, so I’ll look at that and make sure that’s what actually is in there,” he said. “But listen, I will tell you all my position on personnel has always been, I don’t comment on it publicly. I’m happy to talk broadly about the way we do personnel decisions here.”

Chancery Judge Neil Harris booted a member of the media from the courtroom Thursday morning, saying he would hold a closed hearing in a legal dispute between two companies that previously ran a program to nab uninsured motorists.
After having a bailiff tape paper over the window so nobody could see him on the bench, Harris decided to unseal the court file in the case that three politically connected Mississippians filed against their partner, Georgia-based Securix LLC. Attorneys for both sides said when they emerged from the courtroom that Harris had decided to unseal the file. The file could be unsealed Thursday afternoon.
Exhibits and financial records, they said, will remain closed.
READ MORE: Private business ticketed uninsured Mississippi vehicle owners. Then the program blew up.
What was previously known about the lawsuit comes from its brief removal to federal court in Gulfport, where the file is open.
The three Mississippians, operating as QJR LLC, sued in September to dissolve their partnership with Securix LLC in the uninsured motorist program. QJR also is suing Securix and its chairman, Jonathan Miller of Georgia, for defamation.
“They (QJR) want to stop the defamation from ruining political careers, that’s their argument,” Securix attorney Albert R. Jordan IV said in the federal case, a hearing transcript shows.

Very little else was known about the lawsuit, which QJR asked Harris to seal. Harris obliged. By Thursday, QJR had no objection to the file being unsealed, said company member Robert Wilkinson, a Pascagoula attorney.
MS media fights for court access
Media companies Mississippi Today and the Sun Herald on July 14 asked the state Supreme Court to compel Harris to open the court file. Court files are open by law. A compelling reason for closing a court file must be demonstrated in an open hearing, weighing the interests of the public against litigants’ right to privacy, Mississippi case law has established. Harris never held such a hearing before closing the file.
Securix uses automatic license plate readers, usually mounted on traffic signals, to capture images of license plates. With the help of artificial intelligence, Securix can extract license plate numbers from the images.
The company aimed to team up with Mississippi cities to share in revenue from the program. Ticketed vehicle owners were offered the option of showing proof of insurance, entering a diversion program for $300 or taking their cases to court, where they could face stiffer consequences.
In May 2021, the city of Ocean Springs was the first client Securix LLC signed on. Securix teamed up with QJR so the Mississippi partners could help secure more contracts, municipal records show. QJR members, who used their first names for the company initials, are Quinton Dickerson and Josh Gregory of Frontier Strategies in the metro Jackson area, plus attorney Robert Wilkinson.
Both Gregory and Wilkinson were in court Thursday with QJR’s attorney, Jaklyn Wrigley of Ocean Springs.

Frontier is an advertising agency that has managed state and local political campaigns, while Wilkinson has worked with numerous government entities, including the city of Ocean Springs.
Securix Mississippi was able to sign on the cities of Senatobia, Pearl and Biloxi for the uninsured motorist program. But the Mississippi Department of Public Safety shut down Securix access to a crucial insured motorist database in August, after Securix LLC chairman Miller raised concerns about whether proper law enforcement controls were in place, according to DPS.
Miller claimed QJR had stopped sharing program information and access with him in March 2024.

Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.

The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.










The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling.


– Oregon Republican state Rep. Cyrus Javadi


Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.

Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.

Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

Mount Grizzly 399, Mount Liberty ruled out by state naming board.
The post Equality, Raven Peak mulled as names for Grand Teton summit with disgraced leader’s name appeared first on WyoFile .","JACKSON — On a family trip to the Tetons last fall, Jim Greer, an entrepreneur and project manager from Ogden, Utah, started thinking of new names for a mountain in the northern Teton Range.
Teton peaks are generally named with indigenous words like Teewinot — a Shoshone word meaning “many pinnacles” — for critters, like Eagles Rest Peak, and for historical men, like artist Thomas Moran. 
None are named after women, Greer said. So he and his family thought up Nellie Tayloe Ross Peak to honor Wyoming’s — and the United States’ — first female governor. They later reconsidered, settling on a shorter, punchier name: “Equality Peak.”
“It’s an aspirational value that’s embedded in our democracy,” Greer said of the concept of equality.
Greer and his family submitted the name to the Wyoming Board of Geographic Names, which was tangling with what to rename Mount Woodring. In April, it recommended Equality Peak as the massif’s new moniker, sending its pitch to a national naming board, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names, which makes the call on geographic place names.
Woodring is an 11,595-foot mountain that rises over Leigh Lake south of Mount Moran, home to iconic ski lines like the Fallopian Tube Couloir.
While researching a book, Moose resident and retired professor Bob Righter discovered that the mountain’s namesake and Grand Teton National Park’s first superintendent inappropriately touched a young girl and, for doing so, was later removed from his post. 
Samuel T. Woodring was Grand Teton National Park’s first superintendent, serving from May 1929 to July 1934. Woodring reportedly inappropriately touched a young girl. The mountain that bears his name in Grand Teton Park may soon have a new one.
(Jackson Hole Historical Society)
Righter and two of his former graduate students, Paul Horton, an accomplished Teton climber, and Bruce Noble, a former National Park Service official, formed an informal committee to research Woodring and the mountain named after him.
They eventually asked the U.S. Board on Geographic Names to rename it, originally intending just to remove Woodring’s name. But in the process, the group was tasked with coming up with a new name. They selected “Raven Peak.”
They now think their chosen name should be given preference over the proposed name Equality Peak.
Wyoming historically has not lived up to its official state moniker as the Equality State, Horton said. He prefers Raven Peak because it is a name taken from the natural world and not a reminder of the state’s political and social shortcomings.
The name Equality Peak “could make a lot of people feel unhappy,” Horton said. “That alone is enough to disqualify it.”
Teton County officials are now seeking public input before weighing into the debate, accepting input at commissioners@tetoncountywy.gov.
What’s in a name?
The naming issue comes as Americans grapple with what to call everything from military bases to mountains.
While the U.S. Board on Geographic Names has the final say on names for geographic places, the President or U.S. Congress can override the naming authority. On the first day of his second term, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to restore the name “Mount McKinley” to Alaska’s tallest peak, officially dubbed “Denali” in 2015 to honor Indigenous peoples’ name for the mountain. Trump has also restored the names of seven Army bases, like Fort Robert E. Lee, honoring Confederate leaders.
The United States Board of Geographic Names has not made its decision and is seeking input from agencies like Teton County and Teton Park before doing so, according to Elisabeth Hernandez, executive director of the Wyoming Board of Geographic Names.
Given Woodring’s tumultuous past, the 13-member state board, composed of state officials and individuals appointed by the governor, voted this spring to remove the park boss’ name from the Teton peak.
They then voted to recommend renaming the mountain Equality Peak.
“Wyoming may not be the peak of equality in society,” member Jessica Otto said at an April meeting. “It’s something to strive for.”
Although the Wyoming Board of Geographic Names has already removed Woodring’s name from the mountain, the U.S. naming board does not remove names without assigning new ones, Hernandez said. That means the peak is still technically called Mount Woodring, but the state can remove the name from any promotional products. It’s not clear when the national board will make its decision, Hernandez said.
Rallying support
When Greer, who pitched Equality Peak, learned a group of Wyoming high schoolers in Green River had recently wrapped up a project on Gov. Nellie Tayloe Ross, who inspired his family’s original idea for a name, he got in touch with their teacher.

Potter, who administered the oath of office. (Wyoming State Archives)
Greer asked Green River High School’s senior government teacher Bridgette Nielson to read his proposal to rename the mountain Equality Peak. The students did so, and many found it convincing, Nielson said.
But a group of Green River girls preferred “Mount Liberty,” saying liberty encompasses equality but also hints at respect for America’s wide open spaces and way of life, Nielson said.
“I was so proud of them,” she said. “I want to teach my students to know that their voice matters, and it’s important to be involved.”
But because the board received so many letters supporting Equality Peak from Green River high schoolers, it opted to move forward with Equality Peak, rather than Mount Liberty, Nielson said.
Skiing and civics
In the late 1990s, Mark Newcomb led a group of young skiers up and then down the mountain then named for Woodring.
“The snow was soft and it was a calm sunny day,” Newcomb told the News&Guide, “kind of the perfect classic day when you can stand on a Teton summit and see all kinds of other great skiing possibilities.”
Newcomb, the mountain guide-turned-chair of the Teton County Board of County Commissioners, led a meeting Monday in which commissioners briefly discussed a new name for the northern Teton point of prominence. He favored the name pitched by Righter, Horton and Noble: Raven Peak.
Newcomb has sat atop the Grand Teton many times and watched ravens play around in the high elevation wind currents.
“It’s pretty awe-inspiring,” Newcomb said.
Ravens are commonly featured in Native American stories and traditions. The name, Newcomb said, might remind people of the great respect Native Americans had for the Tetons.
Teton County Commission Vice Chair Wes Gardner said Raven Peak was a nice, “non-sticky” name for the mountain.
Commissioners discussed sending a letter Monday to the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. Instead, the five-member board opted to hold off and gather public input, then send a letter to the U.S. naming board.
Strong women
The Wyoming Board of Geographic Names considered — but shortly thereafter ruled out — naming the Teton peak for another famous Wyoming matriarch.
At an October meeting, board member Calvin Williams suggested naming the mountain “Mount Grizzly 399.” A commuter had just struck and killed the world famous bear. Shelley Messer, then executive director of the naming board, liked the idea.
“If we’re going to name it after a strong female, Mount Grizzly 399 would be appropriate,” Messer said. “She is iconic.”
But the Board of Geographic Names “strongly discourages proposals to apply proper animal names or nicknames to geographic features,” Messer said.
The board never formally voted on the grizzly name but the discussion stopped there.

Experts say Medicaid cuts will exacerbate rural communities’ access to mental health care (Spencer Platt/Getty Images).Across the nation, Medicaid is the single largest payer for mental health care, and in rural America, residents disproportionately rely on the public insurance program.
But Medicaid cuts in the massive tax and spending bill signed into law earlier this month will worsen mental health disparities in those communities, experts say, as patients lose coverage and rural health centers are unable to remain open amid a loss of funds.
“The context to begin with is, even with no Medicaid cuts, the access to mental health services in rural communities is spotty at best, just very spotty at best — and in many communities, there’s literally no care,” said Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors.
Cuts over the next 10 years could force low-income rural families to pay for mental health care out of pocket on top of driving farther for care, experts say. Many will simply forgo care for depression, bipolar disorder and other illnesses that need consistent treatment.
“Not only do you have very few services available, but you don’t have the resources to pay for the services,” Manderscheid said. “That makes the problem even worse.”
Rural communities are already at higher risk of suicide, with rates almost doubling over the past two decades. Already, rural communities are grappling with a shortage in mental health professionals, making them more vulnerable to losses compared with more urban areas, experts say.
Paul Mackie, assistant director of the Center for Rural Behavioral Health at Minnesota State University, Mankato, studies rural mental health workforce shortages.
“If it [coverage] goes away, what would then be the person’s next option if they already don’t have the resources?” said Mackie, who grew up on a rural Michigan dairy farm. “You can have a rural psychologist or a rural clinical social worker working under a shingle, literally alone.”
Small rural hospitals often provide critical behavioral health care access, he said. One analysis found the cuts next year would leave 380 rural hospitals at risk of shutting down.
Under President Donald Trump’s signature legislation, states that expanded Medicaid through the 2010 Affordable Care Act will have to redetermine eligibility twice a year on millions enrolled in the program. Some Medicaid recipients also will have to prove work history.
The new law creates work requirement exceptions for those with severe medical conditions — including mental disorders and substance use — but experts say proving those conditions may be convoluted. The exact qualifications and diagnoses for the exceptions haven’t been spelled out, according to a report by KFF, a health policy research organization.
“You can’t work when your mental illness is not treated,” said Dr. Heidi Alvey, an emergency and critical care medicine physician in Indiana. “It’s so counter to the reality of the situation.”
Alvey worked seven years at Baylor Scott & White Health’s hospital in Temple, Texas. As nearby rural critical access hospitals and other mental health centers shut down, the hospital became the only access point for people hours away, she said.
“People who just had absolutely no access to care were coming hours in to see us,” she said. Many had serious untreated mental health conditions, she said, and had to wait days or weeks in the emergency department until a care facility had an open bed.
She’s concerned that Medicaid cuts will only make those problems worse.
Jamie Freeny, director of the Center for School Behavioral Health at advocacy group Mental Health America of Greater Houston, worries for the rural families her center serves. The organization works with school districts across the state, including those in rural communities. Nearly 40% of the state’s more than 1,200 school districts are classified as rural.
She remembers one child whose family had to drive to another county for behavioral health. The family lost coverage during the Medicaid unwinding, as pandemic provisions for automatic re-reenrollment expired. The child stopped taking mental health medication and ended up dropping out of school.
“The child wasn’t getting the medicine that they needed, because their family couldn’t afford it,” Freeny said. “The catalyst for that was a lack of Medicaid. That’s just one family.
“Now, you’re multiplying that.”
Family medicine physician Dr. Ian Bennett sees Medicaid patients at the Vallejo Family Health Services Center of Solano County in California’s Bay Area. The community health clinic serves patients from across the area’s rural farm communities and combines primary care with mental health care services, Bennett said.
“When our patients lose Medicaid, which we expect that they will, then we’ll have to continue to take them, and that will be quite a strain on the finances of that system,” Bennett said. The center could even close, he said.
“The folks who are having the most difficulty managing their lives — and that’s made worse by having depression or substance use disorder — are going to be the folks most likely to drop off,” said Bennett, a University of Washington mental health services researcher. “The impacts down the road are clearly going to be much worse for society as we have less people able to function.”
The psychiatric care landscape across Michigan’s rural western lower peninsula is already scarce, said Joseph “Chip” Johnston. He’s the executive director of the Centra Wellness Network, a publicly funded community mental health care provider for Manistee and Benzie counties. The network serves Medicaid and uninsured patients from high-poverty communities.
“I used to have psychiatric units close by as an adjunct to my service,” he said. “And they’ve all closed. So, now the closest [psychiatric bed] for a child, for example, is at least two hours away.”
Those facilities are also expensive. A one-night stay in an inpatient psychiatric facility can be anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 a night, he said.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Autumn Tree Top knows what a high school certificate means.
It can mean higher pay, college and a career.
It can mean setting an example for her children. 
It can mean stability, fulfillment and confidence.
Each morning, the 29-year-old mother of three wakes up early and goes to school at the Career Learning Center of the Black Hills. She works at Taco John’s as a shift manager and lives at OneHeart transitional housing in Rapid City. 
Tree Top, who is Lakota, wants to become a social worker, or perhaps work with kids. She believes her personal experience with addiction, dropping out of school, homelessness and interacting with the justice system will help her connect with those she serves. Staff at the center are helping her decide what path is best.
South Dakota schools left ‘scrambling’ after feds withhold $25.8 million in funding

She started working toward her high school equivalency certificate this year and just has to pass her math test before her children can watch her walk across the stage.
“It’s challenging. But it’s helping me feel like I’m achieving something I missed an opportunity for a long time ago,” Tree Top said. “Now I get that chance again.”
That chance is in jeopardy for thousands of South Dakotans like Tree Top, according to directors of adult education centers.
The U.S. Department of Education paused distribution of $6.8 billion in congressionally approved funds for schools and educational programs on June 30, saying it was reviewing the funding to ensure it’s spent “in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities.” The department has since released $1.3 billion for summer programs and before- and after-school programs, but the rest remains out of reach for schools and adult education centers.
Advocates warn of economic ‘ripple effect’
Adult education programs help students prepare for high school equivalency exams, such as the GED tests. That credential allows South Dakotans to apply for college, enroll in an apprenticeship program or apply for a job that requires a diploma. The programs can also offer civics and citizenship instruction; workplace, health, family and digital literacy training; and correctional education for prisoners reentering society.
Adult education advocates worry not only about the paused funding, but about potential future funding cuts, said Sharon Bonney, CEO of the Coalition on Adult Basic Education. President Donald Trump has attempted to dismantle the federal Department of Education, and his budget request in May included $12 billion in spending cuts for the department. Some advocacy groups have said the budget proposal doesn’t include funding for adult education.
Given the “number of victories” Trump has secured this year, Bonney expects “he’ll have his way” on education spending, too.
Bonney said programs nationwide anticipate layoffs and closures. That would create a ripple effect in the workforce and economy, she said, keeping people from getting the education they need to find a job, go to college or increase their pay.
South Dakota reported 1,833 adult learners in the state based on the latest available data. Just under 15,000 working-age adults in South Dakota aren’t in the workforce and don’t have a GED certificate, while another 39,129 are working without high school credentials, according to the National Reporting System for Adult Education.
Loss in federal funding ‘destroys’ SD programs
Federal funding on average accounts for 45% of adult education government funding in South Dakota, based on 2024 grant awards.
South Dakota programs haven’t received $1.4 million in funding due to the freeze. In 2024, four adult education organizations and two school districts received a combined total of $1.26 million in federal funds to operate. The state covered another $1.2 million.
The state Department of Labor and Regulation is sending adult education organizations some funding leftover from last year’s grants and state general fund appropriations. The money will help fill gaps through the end of September, according to a department spokesperson.
Black Hills Special Services operates the Career Learning Center that Tree Top attends. It received $513,710 in combined state and federal funding in 2024 — 100% of its operating budget, according to Stephenie Rittberger, adult education coordinator. Federal funding accounts for 32% of its budget.

Of its 517 students, 428 self-report as low-income, a majority are Native American, 101 live in unstable housing and 68 experienced homelessness in the last year.
Demand for adult education is growing in the Black Hills and Rapid City area, Rittberger said. Less federal funding could mean cutting programs and forcing students to sit on waiting lists.
A 32% gap in funding due to the federal loss is something Rittberger said local businesses and local governments can’t fill, especially when they’re already contributing. While state and local funding make up the center’s entire operating budget, other entities donate space for classes. One local nonprofit provides funding for test scholarships, which students would have to pay for otherwise.
Federal changes to food assistance will cost South Dakota $5 million annually

“I can’t expand, I can’t look at what’s better or what’s next,” Rittberger said. “I need to look at how to keep my sites as best I can because I know when rural places or Rapid City loses a service, it takes years to get it back.”
For Cornerstones Career Learning Center, a Huron-based adult learning program with offices across eastern South Dakota, a nearly 50% shortfall in its operating budget “destroys” its program. It will have to cut the number of people served or shrink the geographical area, said Executive Director Kim Olson.
The organization receives more from the state and federal government than any other adult education center in South Dakota: $783,310 in 2024, including $392,810 from the federal government. It provides virtual adult education classes to 836 people across the eastern half of the state.
Rittberger and Olson said adult learning centers plan to ask for more state funding to replace the potential loss in federal funding. Meanwhile, legislators learned this week that they’re facing a tight budget next year with revenue potentially $25 million short of projections.
Adult education delivers a return on investment, advocates say
Students and staff both feel the stress of the funding freeze, Rittberger said. Teachers feel devalued, and students are worried they’ll lose a safe place to learn.
Cynthia Roan Eagle, 54, has been working toward her GED certificate since 2002. Roan Eagle, who is a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, said she is disabled, stemming from an abusive childhood that kept her from graduating high school.
“It’s been trying. I’ve been off and on because of jobs or because I lost the motivation,” Roan Eagle said. “But now I have it. I’m doing this for myself. No one is going to get my diploma for me.”
Roan Eagle works on a mobile cleaning crew at Ellsworth Air Force Base, a job she secured through disability services organization Black Hills Works. Her pay increased from $11.25 to $17.25 an hour because of her increased critical thinking skills and passing subtests on her way to get her GED certificate.

After more than two decades watching her friends and peers earn their credentials, she’s ready. She plans to pass her last test in January and perhaps start taking college courses through Oglala Lakota College or at Black Hills State University. She said Rittberger offered to sit in on some classes with her to see if it’s the right fit.
“If this program is pulled, there’s no way to do this. You can’t get a good paying job, you can’t go on to higher education, you can’t do anything,” Roan Eagle said. “We need this program because it helps a lot of people, including myself.”
English classes, literacy ‘help America become great’
At Cornerstones, 69% of students are English language learners, while the remainder are working on their GED exams.


Federal fallout
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.

Rosemary Hicks earned her GED diploma at 58 years old in March. Originally from Brazil, Hicks and her teenage daughter were deserted by their abusive husband and father in the United States while visiting on a tourist visa in 2017, she said. While she stayed in a women’s shelter in Huron, she was encouraged to take English classes and apply for a green card to become a U.S. citizen.
Hicks is on track to earn her citizenship in September. After that, she plans to take college courses to start a new career in psychology. She currently cleans rooms at the Huron Regional Medical Center — a job she was only able to secure after passing her GED tests.
Earning a better education earns a better future for herself and her daughter, she said, but also for her new country. Without Cornerstones, Hicks said, she wouldn’t have been able to advance in her life or work. 
“I feel safe here. I feel comfortable here. I feel grateful, and I will say to everybody: Stay in school until you can do that,” she said. “No matter if you’re a young adult at 25 or a grandma like me at 58, the important thing is to continue and learn and help America become great.”

Federal agencies are working to establish a unified definition of ultraprocessed foods. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)A handful of government agencies have partnered to create a unified definition of ultraprocessed foods, which they hold are linked to adverse health outcomes. 
The effort is part of the ongoing Make American Healthy Again directive led by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.
“Ultra-processed foods are driving our chronic disease epidemic,” Kennedy said in a press release. “We must act boldly to eliminate the root causes of chronic illness and improve the health of our food supply. Defining ultra-processed foods with a clear, uniform standard will empower us even more to Make America Healthy Again.”
HHS, in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Food and Drug Administration, announced a joint Request for Information, as the first step in the process to develop a federal, uniform definition of ultraprocessed foods. 
Kennedy’s Make American Healthy Again report, released in May, included an entire section about ultraprocessed foods. The report cited the NOVA food classification’s definition that says ultraprocessed foods are: “industrially manufactured food products made up of several ingredients (formulations) including sugar, oils, fats and salt and food substances of no or rare culinary use.” 
These substances include flavors, colorants, non-sugar sweeteners, and emulsifiers. The MAHA report said generally, ultraprocessed foods are ready-to-eat foods that are high in sugars, refined grains or sodium and low in fiber and essential nutrients.
According to the press release from HHS, USDA and FDA, around 70% of packaged products in the U.S. food supply are typically considered ultraprocessed. The release also said children get around 60% of their calories from these foods. 
The release and the Make America Healthy Again report point to ultraprocessed foods as a “driving factor” in the “crisis” of childhood chronic diseases. The consumption of these foods, according to the release, is linked to cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, cancer, obesity, cancer and neurological disorders.  
“The threats posed to our health by foods often considered ultra-processed are clear and convincing, making it imperative that we work in lockstep with our federal partners to advance, for the first time ever, a uniform definition of ultra-processed foods,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said in the release. 
Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins vowed to include the “the great men and women of the agriculture value chain” in the conversation throughout the process. 
“President Trump has made it a priority to improve health outcomes for American families and communities,” Rollins said in the statement. “And this Request for Information is yet another step in seeking commonsense ways to foster improved and more informed consumer choice.” 
The health impacts of ultraprocessed foods are also part of a research initiative between FDA and the National Institutes of Health. A uniform definition will help to “pave the way” for consistent research, policy and the ability to address associated health concerns, according to the HHS release.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests of people without criminal charges or convictions in Florida rose by more than 450% this June compared to last year.
Since the start of the second Trump administration, ICE has carried out more than 10,818 arrests in Florida, up from 3,496 in the same period last year. But in June, the largest share of arrests, 36%, were of people the federal government labeled as having no criminal history in the country, a 457% increase from June 2024.
The latest arrest data from ICE through June 26 was published by the Deportation Data Project and obtained as a result of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. The project is led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York. The anonymized individual arrests dataset provides insight into who the Trump administration is targeting in its goal to ramp up deportations and as Gov. Ron DeSantis insists on making the state a leader in internal immigration enforcement.
“We still got a lot, a lot, a lot that we got to do, but obviously we’ve led the way on this, and we’ll continue setting the pace,” DeSantis said during a Tuesday meeting of the State Board of Immigration Enforcement, which the Florida Legislature created earlier this year and comprises the Florida Cabinet.
The governor emphasized the role of local law enforcement in gaining authorization from the federal government to arrest people they suspect live in the state without legal authorization under a program known as 287(g). Florida law enforcement agencies have the most 287(g) agreements with ICE in the country, 237, extending to police within higher education institutions.

Overcrowding in immigrant detention centers
While the Trump administration’s 3,000 daily arrest quota led to a 31% increase in Florida of arrests of people with criminal convictions between May and June, the biggest jump, 86%, was of people without convictions or charges. However, arrests of people with pending charges decreased by nearly 3%.
Florida’s increase is even higher than the national jump in arrests of people without a U.S. criminal history. According to the data from ICE, such arrests increased by 84% nationwide between May and June. Meanwhile, arrests of immigrants with criminal convictions decreased by 1%.
Living in the country without permanent legal status is not a crime, unless the person has been deported before. However, entering by avoiding immigration authorities is a crime that can be punishable with a fine of up to $250 and six months’ imprisonment for the first offense, per federal statute.
ICE daily detainee estimates have also shown a jump in the people held at the federal facilities in Florida this year. As of June 20, the number of people in immigration detention at three Florida facilities was 111% higher than the levels before the inauguration, according to an analysis by Human Rights Watch. Overall, the estimated daily detainee population as of July 17 was 1,932, which is nearly 500 more than before Trump took office.
Although the data provide daily estimates of detention, Florida has been less transparent in its operations of the notorious immigrant removal center it built in eight days in the Everglades.
The most detailed information came from the Miami Herald’s publication on July 13 of a list of 750 detainees housed in the old airstrip, including more than 250 people without criminal convictions or pending charges in the U.S.

Immigrants made to eat ‘like dogs’
Class action: Immigrants demand access to attorneys in state detention center

Detainees at three federal facilities in Florida and the state-run immigrant center in the Everglades have said they were given rotting food, denied medical care and access to their attorneys, according to a federal lawsuit and the Human Rights Watch report. Five of the 11 deaths of immigrants under ICE custody this year have happened in Florida, according to press releases from the federal agency.
Human Rights Watch’s report, published Monday, states that immigrants at three federal detention centers in Florida are held “under conditions that flagrantly violate international human rights standards and the United States government’s own immigration detention standards.”
Immigrants held at the Federal Detention Center in Miami have said they had to kneel to eat while their hands were restrained behind their backs.
“We were chained though, so we could not reach the plates with our hands,” said Harpinder Chauhan, a British man deported in June, whose account was published in the report. “We had to put the plates on chairs and then bend down and eat with our mouths, like dogs.”
Need for beds
To Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, who chairs a statewide immigration advisory council, the added arrests highlight the need for more detention beds. He’s pushing for the federal government to waive housing standards to allow more county jails to detain immigrants.
“The federal housing standards are ridiculous at best and insane at worst,” Judd said during the Tuesday meeting of the state immigration board.
Judd said the federal government didn’t seem amenable to granting the request to allow immigration detainment under Florida jail standards.
“If it’s good enough for those that are innocent until proven guilty, and they’re United States citizens, certainly those housing rules should be sufficient for those that are in this country illegally,” he said.
In his most recent comments about the state’s immigration enforcement efforts, the governor has talked about the need for the federal government to bolster its detention capacity.
Instead of moving quickly with the construction of a second state-run detention center, DeSantis wants to hold off, depending on demand from the feds and the capacity levels at the Everglades site state officials named “Alligator Alcatraz,” because of the dangerous reptiles would deter escape attempts.
DeSantis has emphasized the influx of $45 billion Congress gave ICE to build new detention centers as part of Trump’s massive tax and spending cut bill.
“We’ve gone above and beyond in Florida to assist this mission, because we think it’s really important for our state and for our country,” DeSantis said. “But they absolutely are going to need to take all that massive amount of money they just got and be able to provide a better ability to hold, process, and deport illegals.”
The seeming slowdown in opening the second state detention center at the Florida National Guard Joint Training Center in Clay County comes as the DeSantis administration faces mounting legal challenges to the Everglades facility located in Collier County. There is also growing scrutiny from Democratic lawmakers about the $245 million the DeSantis administration has spent to build and operate the detention center in just a month, according to AP.

(C-SPAN screengrab)Republican partisan Sigal Chattah’s days at the helm of the Nevada U.S. Attorney’s office appear to be numbered, given President Donald Trump’s failure thus far to nominate Chattah to the permanent position.
Chattah, while serving as Nevada’s National Republican Committeewoman, became the state’s acting U.S. attorney on April 1, a position with a shelf life of 120 days. Her interim term as U.S. Attorney ends July 30 and Trump has yet to reveal his next move.
Gov. Joe Lombardo’s office did not respond when asked if the governor was aware of Trump’s plans. 
Nevada’s U.S. Senators Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen are vowing to attempt to derail Senate confirmation hearings for Chattah, should Trump appoint her.
“Sigal Chattah hasn’t been formally nominated for this position and the Administration has made no announcement of their long-term intentions after Ms. Chattah’s interim position is over next week,” a spokesperson for Cortez Masto said Wednesday. “She is unfit for this role and if President Trump tries to install her for a four-year term, Cortez Masto will not return a blue slip and will strongly oppose her nomination.” 
A “blue slip” is a blue form sent to senators of home-state judicial nominees by the Senate Judiciary Committee seeking approval or disapproval of a nominee. An unreturned slip can stall or end a nomination. 
“If she’s ever nominated to a permanent Senate-confirmed position, I’ll do everything in my power to block her confirmation,” Rosen said in a statement, adding Chattah is “an extremist who is deeply unfit for this role.” 
During her unsuccessful run in 2022 for Nevada attorney general, Chattah declared her Democratic opponent, incumbent Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Black man, “should be hanging from a f–king crane”; longed for fewer “pronoun badges” and transgender individuals in America, while describing them with an offensive slur; and invited comparisons with Sen. Joe McCarthy and former Pres. Donald Trump by calling for the imprisonment of political foes. 
“Chattah’s disturbing past statements promising to use any public office to go after her political opponents, as well as her well-documented history of racist remarks, conspiracy theories, and threats of violence, prove that she cannot be trusted with this important responsibility,” Rosen said. 
On Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee, which appears unfazed by Trump’s strategy of allowing some interim terms to expire, advanced seven of Trump’s interim picks for U.S. Attorney. Chattah was not among them. 
Trump’s picks for U.S. Attorney have resulted in widespread resignations in some states. The Times of San Diego reported Wednesday that as many as 10 federal prosecutors have quit under Interim U.S. Attorney Adam Gordon, and other high-ranking lawyers have been demoted.  
The expiration of Chattah’s term next week would trigger a provision of federal law that allows Federal District Court judges to either appoint her to an indefinite term, or make their own appointment. 
Chattah did not respond to requests for comment.
When the term of New Jersey’s Interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, Trump’s former personal attorney, expired this week, federal judges appointed another prosecutor to the office. However, Attorney General Pam Bondi fired the employee, Desiree Leigh Grace, to prevent her ascension. Habba is the president’s former personal attorney. Grace, however, wrote on LinkedIn Wednesday that she will lead the office. 
Courts in other states, including Texas, Alaska, Illinois, Maryland, and Pennsylvania have either appointed Trump’s interim picks to four-year terms or extended their terms, a move designed in some instances to avoid lengthy and contentious Senate confirmation hearings. 
A spokesperson for the U.S. District Court in Las Vegas did not immediately respond to inquiries about whether judges there are taking up Chattah’s appointment.  
Like Chattah, who was appointed April 1, a number of Trump’s interim appointees are facing the end of their terms and the possibility of being reappointed by the courts.
Federal judges in the Northern District of Illinois say they’ll decide by August 5 whether to appoint Trump’s interim pick for that seat, Andrew Boutros, to the permanent position. 
Federal judges for the Northern District of New York declined to appoint Trump’s interim U.S. Attorney John Sarcone III, so the Justice Department found a workaround and appointed him to be special attorney to the U.S. attorney, a position that can keep him in place for seven months. 
During her short term, Chattah has overseen a number of cases, almost all of which were initiated by her predecessor, Jason Frierson, a former Democratic legislative leader.  
She returned forfeited funds to victims, including $531,308.46 fraudulently obtained via Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans; $1,068,123.94 to the Small Business Administration for fraudulently obtained PPP loans; and $32,193,787.94 to an undisclosed victim, according to her office. 
Chattah also took part in a nationwide “Health Care Fraud Takedown,” which resulted in criminal charges against 324 defendants nationwide, according to a news release. 
The defendants in the two Nevada cases – a registered nurse who received $7.3 million in kickbacks for recommending and ordering unnecessary treatments, and a nurse practitioner who fraudulently billed Medicare for more than $14 million, according to a news release. 
“Make no mistake – this administration will not tolerate criminals who line their pockets with taxpayer dollars while endangering the health and safety of our communities,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in the news release.

Bernalillo County's Infrastructure Capital Improvement Plan, used to prioritize capital outlay-funded projects, ranks three ABCWUA projects among its top 10 most important needs.  (Courtesy Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority)By the end of the 2024 fiscal year, an estimated $5.9 billion in capital outlay funds — money designated for New Mexico infrastructure projects such as roads, water systems and public schools — had gone unspent, a historic high.
At the Wednesday morning interim legislative Capital Outlay Subcommittee’s first meeting since the most recent session, two state analysts offered lawmakers ways to address the shortcomings in the state’s capital outlay process leading to the unspent funds.
Some of the problems they identified included a lack of sufficient funds for all the capital outlay requests; piecemeal funding; inadequate eligibility and vetting requirements; and no connection between localities’ plans and lawmakers’ appropriations.
Legislative Finance Committee Principal Analyst Cally Carswell told the committee New Mexico’s current system meets the Legislature’s goal of empowering individual lawmakers to direct public funding to priorities in their districts as they see fit.
However, she said, the capital outlay process doesn’t meet other goals of consistently putting state resources toward the most critical and beneficial projects and local communities’ priorities; improving quality of life; subsidizing investments to support public services; and accelerating economic progress across the state.
“The system is really not structured currently to service these goals or support them,” she said. “In fact, it presents a lot of structural barriers to achieving these goals.”
The subcommittee on Wednesday didn’t formally vote on changes to the capital outlay process but their discussion previewed legislative proposals that could be introduced in the 2026 session.
Rep. Derrick Lente (D-Sandia Pueblo) told the committee the system must change.
“Under the current system, we are often spreading the total money available too thinly and underfunding projects time and again, term after term, year after year,” he said. “This means that it takes too long to complete projects, or they never get completed at all.”
More requests than money to give
The Legislature’s practice of dividing money among individual lawmakers, called “member share,” makes it harder to adequately fund projects because the requests lawmakers receive exceed what they have, Carswell said.
This year, local governments asked for $3.9 billion in capital outlay; however, just under $600 million was available, according to data in Carswell’s and New Mexico Department of Finance and Administration Infrastructure Planning & Development Division Director Wesley Billingsley’s presentation to the committee.
“This dynamic has remained true even as our revenues to the program have surged,” Carswell said. “There has been this perception, since the state has been in a strong financial position, that the resources are sort of endless. But at the end of the day, you have still had pretty small amounts of money relative to the demand that is out there.”
This results in piecemeal funding, she said, and lawmakers expressing “increasing frustration” about their inability to support large projects on their own without substantial support from the governor.
Approximately 44% of nearly 1,400 projects in the 2025 capital outlay bill received less than half of what they requested, the presentation states. Only five projects received $10 million or more.
Too easy to sit on money
The process includes minimal eligibility requirements to ask for and receive capital outlay money, Carswell said, which contributes to the spate of requests and hinders their effective prioritization.
When localities don’t spend capital outlay dollars lawmakers already approved in prior years, she said, they don’t need to meet any benchmarks to request a re-authorization and they can continue to ask to push spending deadlines as many times as they want. A lawmaker just has to sign off, she said.
“It’s very hard for members to say no,” she said. “There’s not really a good reason for you to do that.”
Lente said reauthorizations need strict time limits.
“We can’t afford to continue to roll this money over and over when we have larger projects looming that we could do a lot of good in the state with,” he said.
Funding doesn’t follow local plans
The Legislature consistently puts funding toward projects before localities are ready to spend the money, Carswell said and, in some cases, before they have even created “operational” plans for maintaining and running a facility or project.
Billingsley said local government officials should ask his agency for help with their projects before approaching lawmakers, because they can apply for other grants before seeking capital outlay dollars. 
Ideally, localities rank their needs on a five-year plan, Carswell said; however, the current system makes it difficult to fund their most important and largest needs.
In the last round, localities ranked 564 projects costing at least $5 million in their top five, yet 350 of those had received zero capital outlay funding as of Monday, according to the presentation.
“We’re missing that opportunity to use these great surpluses that we have to accomplish the bigger, more important things that our communities are telling us that they need,” Carswell said.
Potential solutions
Carswell said potential ways of addressing the capital outlay system include: allowing only one extension per appropriation; shortening extensions from two years to one; and no longer allowing pre-approved funding to be moved to an entirely different project or purpose.
Lawmakers could also ban capital outlay from going to water, sewer and road projects, which other programs already fund, she said, or [the LFC] could encourage lawmakers to not fund those kinds of projects with capital outlay or scrutinize them more carefully.
Rep. Pat Woods (R-Broadview) said he supports LFC and DFA working together to create eligibility and prioritization criteria for capital outlay requests that lawmakers can write into state law.
Both Rep. Meredith Dixon (D-Albuquerque) and Sen. George Muñoz (D-Gallup) said they supported codifying stricter guidelines, noting that neither the  Legislature nor the executive branch excel at following loose policy guidelines.
“I support making this a better and more effective process, and I don’t think ‘encouraging’ legislators actually works,” Dixon said.

Santiago/Getty Images)Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.

The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.
New Mexico’s largest city affirms ‘immigrant-friendly’ status












 The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling. 


–  – Oregon Republican state Rep. Cyrus Javadi


Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.
Resentment against Albuquerque ‘deliveristas’ may have sparked viral Walmart ICE arrest

Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.

Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

July 24, 2025 | Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceSecretary of State Jocelyn Benson is rolling in campaign cash, she says to the tune of $3.5 million, since launching her campaign seeking the Michigan Democratic Party nomination for governor in 2026 – doubling what Gov. Gretchen Whitmer raised in the first six months of her 2018 gubernatorial bid.
The numbers show enthusiasm for Benson among Michigan Democrats, with more than 27,000 individual contributions and the vast majority of them under $1000 each. The donations also came from each of Michigan’s 83 counties.
“What all this support represents to me is not only a stamp of approval, but this is our team. We are members of an active effort to make Michigan the best place to call home,” Benson said in a news conference announcing the numbers on Thursday. “We believe that we all do well when we all do well. We believe that economic prosperity grows when everyone has a fair shot to succeed. That every voice matters, every vote counts, and that the power of the people will always be greater than the people in power.”

Benson said that although her department and her counterparts in the executive office, like Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel, have accomplished many things over the last eight years, people were still struggling to afford homes and live in the communities they want, while also struggling to pay for basic necessities and medical needs.
“I believe government can – and I’ve seen this firsthand as Secretary of State – show up when we need it and then get out of the way when we don’t,” Benson said. “We can together enact policies that will make life more affordable for every Michigander, saving them time, saving them money and making their lives a little easier. That’s exactly what I’ve worked to do for the last nearly eight years as secretary of state, and that’s exactly my mission as Michigan’s next governor.”
Benson was joined Thursday by Democratic state officials including Rep. Julie Brixie of Okemos, Rep. Jimmie Wilson Jr. of Ypsilanti and Rep. Joey Andrews of St. Joseph.
Brixie said Benson’s work has resonated with Michiganders in all areas of the state and that she is the only Democrat in the race who can win the general election, which at present is a three-way race between the eventual Democratic and Republican nominees and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a former Democrat who is running as an independent.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“She outraised both of her Democratic primary opponents combined, and not even by a little,” Brixie said. “She’s doubled them. That kind of grassroots, institutional support doesn’t happen by accident. It happens when the candidate is serious, prepared and well respected all across Michigan.”
Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II, Genesee Sheriff Chris Swanson and former Cape Coral, Fla., Mayor Marni Sawicki are also seeking the Democratic Party nomination.
On the Republican side, U.S. Rep. John James of Shelby Township, state Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt of Portage, former Attorney General Mike Cox, former House Speaker Tom Leonard of DeWitt, Genesee County truck driver Anthony Hudson and Traverse City native Evan Space are seeking their party’s nomination.
Wilson said his constituents will routinely tell him that Benson’s work as secretary of state has helped them save time and make dealings with her department less of a headache. He also said that her fundraising haul was extraordinary.
Andrews touched on the fact that going to Secretary of State outposts around the state have been transformed from daylong visits to quick trips with more convenient options.
“The whole thing was kind of a punchline,” Andrews said. “It’s been remarkable the efficiency that we’ve seen that nobody thought you could do with a secretary of state’s office.”’
Andrews also noted that Benson would be a people-first governor, contrasting her governing style against her Republican opponents’ fealty to President Donald Trump and what he called Duggan’s flip-flopping politics.
“[Duggan is] running as an independent because, frankly, he looked at polling about six months ago and realized he couldn’t win the Democratic primary and decided he’d rather try to play spoiler because his ego can’t handle the rejection of not being the anointed one, or something to that effect.” Andrews said. “We need to be real about what that means. … The map is not there, but what he can do is ensure that somebody like John James becomes the governor instead.”
 Nikki Goldschein, Benson’s campaign manager, in a statement also noted that the fundraising haul solidifies the secretary of state’s standing in the race as its frontrunner.
“The numbers make it clear: Jocelyn Benson is the best candidate to take on any candidate, Republican or Independent, in November 2026,” Goldschein said. “This record-breaking haul not only showcases the strength of this campaign, but it tells the story of the movement we are building. Supporters from every corner of our state are on board with Jocelyn’s vision to make Michigan the best place to be a kid, raise a kid and call home.”
Michigan Advance asked Benson if the fundraising figures indeed allow her to pivot to a general election mindset. 
Benson said she was already there.
“From day one, I’ve been focused on building the kind of campaign that will be poised to win in November 2026,” she said. “What these numbers demonstrate today is that we are building that effort. It’s also important for us to unify our party and, frankly, unify the state behind a message of affordability, ensuring we’re addressing the rising cost of living and stagnant wages in our state.”
Benson added that those messages were the ones voters needed to hear now, and that she would be laser-focused on those issues for the next 16 months.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1000067943-1024x922.jpg,,,2025-07-24 13:57:13.530009
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-24 17:13:07+00:00,CT Mirror,Yale New Haven Health to cut youth gender-affirming care services,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/24/yale-new-haven-health-youth-gender-affirming-care/,News that YNHH will no longer provide medication for gender-affirming care services comes a day after a similar announcement from CCMC.,"Yale New Haven Health will no longer provide medication treatment as part of its gender-affirming care services for patients 19 and under, a spokesperson confirmed Thursday morning.
The announcement comes one day after Connecticut Children’s Medical Center publicly announced that it would be “winding down” its gender-affirming care program for children. The two facilities were the most prominent providers of youth gender-affirming care in the state. 
Both will continue to provide behavioral health services. While there are other providers of medication treatment for children in the state, the cancellation of these programs at the two largest pediatric hospitals in Connecticut is sure to have an  impact on the availability of services for the populations they serve.
The Yale health system made the decision after “carefully monitoring federal executive orders and administrative actions” relating to gender-affirming care for children, wrote the spokesperson in a statement provided to The Connecticut Mirror. 
“This decision was not made lightly. We are aware of the profound impact that this decision will have on the patients treated in this program, as well as their families. We are committed to offering transitional support as the medication treatment component of the pediatric gender-affirming care program winds down, and our providers will continue to provide mental health and other health care services to these patients in a compassionate care environment,” the statement reads.
Yale New Haven Health is the state’s largest health system by net patient revenue.
Melissa Soto, a Farmington resident whose 16-year-old son receives gender-affirming care at Yale, received a letter from the health system by mail on Thursday morning informing patients of the hospital’s decision and committing to working with them to develop a transition plan for care. 
Soto’s son, whom she declined to name, began seeing a Yale provider for gender-affirming care in October 2023, after waiting more than a year for an appointment. For about six months, she said, her son received only behavioral health services. Then, after meetings with “numerous medical professionals,” including a therapist and endocrinologist, he began receiving hormone therapy.
Soto said she will find another provider that can get her son access to medication, but that he will continue to see physicians at Yale for behavioral health.
“They are his doctors and he trusts them. And that’s important,” Soto said.
On Wednesday, in response to the news about Connecticut Children’s, Gov. Ned Lamont issued a statement lamenting the decision and standing with trans youth and their families in Connecticut.
“It’s disappointing for hospitals in Connecticut to be forced to make the difficult decision to end gender-affirming care for minors in response to the federal executive order. These decisions are not based on Connecticut values or Connecticut law—they part of a series of relentless federal demands that have created fear, confusion, and legal uncertainty for our healthcare providers,” Lamont said.
“To transgender youth and their families in Connecticut: you are not alone. We see you, we support you, and we are working closely with the Attorney General and hospital leaders to understand the full impact,” the statement continued. “In Connecticut, we do not turn our backs on kids in need.”
On Thursday, a spokesperson for the governor’s office added that the administration is evaluating what the state can do in response to this and other “recent impactful changes from the federal government.” 
“Given that Yale serves a larger population, we will also want to meet with them to better understand the impact on services and those they serve. As for what the state can do, as with any of the recent impactful changes or cuts from the federal government, we’ll evaluate what we’re able to do,” the spokesperson added.
Since President Donald J. Trump took office, his administration has targeted gender-affirming care for children.
In January, Trump signed an executive order aimed at withholding federal funding from institutions, including medical schools and hospitals, that provide gender-affirming care to kids. 
The directive also sought to restrict coverage of those services from federally-run insurance programs, like Medicaid. A federal judge temporarily blocked the order the following month.
Earlier this month, the Department of Justice issued more than 20 subpoenas to providers of youth gender-affirming care in connection with investigations related to “healthcare fraud, false statements, and more.”
Gender-affirming care for children can involve counseling, hormone therapy and puberty blockers. Current medical protocols do not recommend medication or hormones for children who haven’t yet gone through puberty, according to the Yale School of Medicine, but those patients can receive counseling.
Surgery is rarely used as treatment for transgender and gender-diverse children in the U.S., a 2024 Harvard study found.

Nebraska is back into a projected deficit of about $95 million after tax revenues for the year came in below forecasts. 
Legislative Fiscal Analyst Keisha Patent confirmed the situation Thursday at a meeting of the Tax Rate Review Committee. There, she provided state lawmakers with a new financial status report, giving them their first budget update since the 2025 legislative session ended in June. 
Lawmakers this spring grappled with a fluctuating deficit that at one point grew as high as $432 million, ending the session with a projected surplus of about $4 million by the end of the biennium in 2027. However, they still left a projected deficit at the end of the following biennium in 2029 of roughly $129 million. 
The latest update puts the current two-year budget back into the red, facing a projected deficit of $95.3 million. It also increased the projected deficit for the next biennium to $218 million. 
Appropriations Committee Chair State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood said the update  emphasizes the need for spending controls when lawmakers reconvene in 2026. Already, Gov. Jim Pillen has expressed a goal to cut Nebraska’s general fund spending 10% — about $500 million — in the current budget for next year.

The biggest reason for the new shortfall is that Nebraska’s tax receipts for May and June came in $86 million below what Nebraska’s Economic Forecasting Advisory Board predicted in April. Senators drafted the budget based on those projections. 
Additionally, Patent said the projected deficit grew another $10 million because lawmakers authorized another $10 million transferred from cash funds into the general fund after the forecasting board met. This effectively added to the state’s revenue projections, she said.
Several factors could change the projected deficit again before the next regular session, including future meetings of the forecasting board and the committee. Patent said she also expects an update from state agencies on funds that weren’t spent and will carryover to the next budget, and Nebraska’s Department of Revenue will have an update on the impacts of the federal budget reconciliation bill that passed this month.

Clements said he expects the federal changes to impact Nebraska’s budget negatively, though only slightly. His biggest concerns were the “no tax on tips” provision, which he said may minorly reduce Nebraska’s income tax revenues, and the added administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). 
Passage of the federal budget reconciliation bill prompted some worries about the need for a special session to adjust Nebraska’s budget. Committee members — including Clements — had the option Thursday to recommend that the governor call a special session but didn’t.
Clements said he remains confident that there is “no cause for alarm” based on the latest financial status or the federal legislation. He said he hasn’t heard of any adjustments substantial enough to warrant a special session.

(Photo by Carmen Forman/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A state lawmaker said he hopes to tweak a new state law that no longer provides most Oklahomans with the option to obtain paper copies of their vehicle titles.
Sen. Chuck Hall, R-Perry, said the implementation of a new law mandating that vehicle titles be issued electronically, caught many people off guard. Based on feedback he’s received, he plans to work with the House author and Service Oklahoma to change the new law to allow some Oklahomans to receive paper copies of their vehicle titles upon request.
Lawmakers first passed Senate Bill 836 in 2023, but it didn’t take effect until July 1, 2025. The change means that a printed title isn’t sent to the owner or lienholder. Instead, an electronic title is generated for vehicles that are bought, sold or transferred. Existing paper titles are still valid. 
This law aims to help the government operate more efficiently by no longer providing paper copies of ownership paperwork and to relieve the burden on financial institutions that must warehouse titles while maintaining a filing system, Hall said. 
“I think, potentially, it can be a lot easier on Oklahomans who might find it difficult or struggle with staying up with the actual title itself,” he said. “This way, they’ll know exactly where it’s at, at all times up until the point where they’re ready to trade the vehicle or sell it.”
But, he said some Oklahomans were surprised or unaware that the state has transitioned to an electronic titling system. He said he also received calls from fellow legislators who said their constituents wanted a paper title. 
Corey Robertson, a spokesperson for Service Oklahoma, said in an email that the agency has “discussed the possibility of offering a paper title option and are actively exploring how that could be implemented within the current legal and regulatory framework.”
The agency would not make an employee available to be interviewed about change, but did answer a list of e-mailed questions submitted by Oklahoma Voice.  
“Electronic titles reduce the need for duplicate title requests and minimize the risk of fraud, loss and damage,” officials wrote. “They also streamline backend processing and improve efficiency for customers and staff.”
Paper titles can only be issued for a few reasons such as moving to a new state, selling a vehicle out of state or transfer of ownership. Copies of paper titles can then be requested through a tag agency, by completing a form or submitting a request through an OkCars account, officials said. 
The agency said that during private sales, sellers with an electronic title will have to provide an “Electronic Title Bill of Sale,” a form used to transfer ownership of an electronic Oklahoma title. That can be verified by creating an OkCars account. 
Emily Hill, a spokesperson for Service Oklahoma, said in an email that electronic titles are a more secure alternative to paper titles. Oklahomans without internet access can visit a tag agency to verify their electronic titles, the agency said.
“The system uses multiple layers of security including encryption, access controls, audit logs and backups,” Hill said. “Title information is securely stored and only accessible to the vehicle owner or lienholder through a secure login.” 
The agency did not answer a question about how much, if any, money this change would save. They also would not say if they’ve received consumer complaints about the new process.
Rep. Mike Osburn, R-Edmond, the measure’s House author, did not respond to messages seeking comment.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)A federal appeals court on Wednesday agreed with a Seattle judge’s decision to universally block President Donald Trump’s executive order restricting birthright citizenship.
The appeals judges ruled 2-1 that Trump’s order, issued on Inauguration Day, violates the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which states “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.”
“One power that the President was not granted, by Article II or by any other source, is the power to modify or change any clause of the United States Constitution,” Judge Ronald Gould, a Clinton appointee, wrote in his opinion.
Gould’s opinion, joined by Judge Michael Hawkins, sides with U.S. District Court Judge John Coughenour who stopped Trump’s order with an indefinite preliminary injunction in February. Such orders block enforcement while the case proceeds through the courts.
Coughenour called Trump’s order “blatantly unconstitutional.” The lawsuit was brought by Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Illinois and two pregnant noncitizen women who feared their children could be born without citizenship in any country.

In a statement, Washington Attorney General Nick Brown applauded the appeals court ruling.
“The court agrees that the president cannot redefine what it means to be American with the stroke of a pen,” Brown said. “He cannot strip away the rights, liberties, and protections of children born in our country.”
The decision from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals adds to the list of courts that have found Trump’s move unconstitutional and blocked enforcement of it. The ruling comes after the Department of Justice and Washington attorney general’s office argued the case in early June.
Since those arguments, the U.S. Supreme Court decided judges like Coughenour had overstepped their authority in blocking Trump’s order nationwide. The justices ruled nationwide injunctions should be limited to when necessary to “provide complete relief to each plaintiff.”
The high court’s decision left the door open for a checkerboard of states where birthright citizenship remained and others where it didn’t.
The justices didn’t take up the merits of Trump’s order.
Wednesday’s ruling is the second to confirm a complete block is necessary since the Supreme Court decision, after a New Hampshire federal judge certified a nationwide class action suit.
The Trump administration looks to define “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” as only covering people whose primary allegiance is to the United States. So people born to parents only here temporarily or without legal status wouldn’t qualify for citizenship at birth.
In 2022, about 153,000 babies across the country were born to two parents without legal immigration status, including 4,000 in Washington, according to the plaintiffs. The states have said they stand to lose federal funding through programs like Medicaid that otherwise could help these children if they were citizens.
Gould found this argument persuasive, justifying “complete relief” to block the order nationwide. He wrote that Trump’s birthright citizenship order would require states to overhaul their eligibility verification systems for social service programs.
“The preliminary injunction here merely prevents the Executive Branch from denying citizenship to individuals who are likely constitutionally entitled to citizenship,” Gould wrote. “Because, as the district court correctly concluded, the Executive Branch does not have a legitimate interest in violating the Constitution, the Executive Branch has not shown that either the public interest or the balance of equities tips in its favor.”
Judge Patrick Bumatay, a Trump appointee, disagreed, arguing the states lack standing to bring litigation over the order because their financial loss would be a “self-inflicted injury” if they choose to provide benefits to immigrants without legal status.
In his dissent, Bumatay didn’t address the issue of the injunction’s scope.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.
Worksite immigration raids are supposed to free up jobs for citizens. Here’s what really happens

The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.










The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling.


– Oregon Republican state Rep. Cyrus Javadi



Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.
If Trump wants more deportations, he’ll need to target the construction industry

 
Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.
‘Sanctuary city’ governors object to Trump deployment of troops into Los Angeles

 
Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s two Planned Parenthood clinics can no longer accept Medicaid health insurance for non-abortion health care services.
A provision of Republicans’ “big, beautiful” law that barred Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood for one year took effect in South Carolina on Monday. That’s because a federal judge’s ruling that partially suspended the law elsewhere didn’t apply to the Palmetto State.
Meanwhile, it remains unclear whether the nonprofit can get reimbursed for the visits of about 1,000 Medicaid-covered patients in South Carolina due to a separate lawsuit.
Last month, a U.S. Supreme Court ruling effectively allowed the state to remove Planned Parenthood from its list of approved Medicaid providers, potentially settling a seven-year-old case. But that ruling has yet to take effect.
The nation’s highest court must still send its decision back to a lower court. A judge could decide to simply let Gov. Henry McMaster’s 2018 executive order — which has been blocked by the lawsuit ever since — take effect. Or more legal arguments could be required.
After the June 26 ruling, Planned Parenthood clinics in Columbia and Charleston continued accepting Medicaid for health care services the government insurance program normally would cover, such as cancer screenings, contraceptives, and treatment for sexually transmitted infections. But they haven’t asked the state’s Medicaid agency to get paid for those services, according to Vicki Ringer, a longtime lobbyist for Planned Parenthood in South Carolina.
Since there’s a possibility the judge will let McMaster’s order retroactively take effect with the high court’s ruling, Planned Parenthood doesn’t want to have to pay the state back.
While questions on that case continue, a different federal judge’s ruling on the massive tax-and-spending law signed July 4 by President Donald Trump immediately stopped Planned Parenthood from accepting Medicaid, said spokeswoman Molly Rivera.
That’s because the ruling allowed payments to continue only to clinics that either don’t provide abortions or are parts of regional membership organizations that received no more than $800,000 from Medicaid in 2023. South Carolina’s clinics, which continue to provide abortions as allowed under the state’s 2023 law, met neither of those exceptions.
Planned Parenthood’s attorneys will keep fighting both the federal law’s one-year ban and the state’s executive order, said Susanna Birdsong, an attorney for the nonprofit’s South Atlantic region.
While they involve lawmakers’ decisions seven years apart and separate rulings in different courts, the result is the same — at least, for now.
“They’re pulling at different levers, but the effect is, because we provide abortions, we are not allowed to bill Medicaid for other services we provide,” Birdsong said.
The state Attorney General’s Office did not respond to a request for comment.
Medicaid doesn’t pay for abortions in South Carolina except in cases of rape, incest or to save a patient’s life. However, under the 2023 state law, abortions remain legal until an ultrasound first detects cardiac activity. The state Supreme Court’s most recent ruling in May upholding that law kept the ban at six weeks of pregnancy.
Despite the imminent loss of funding, the state’s clinics aren’t in danger of closing, Ringer said.
Because South Carolina never expanded Medicaid eligibility as the 2010 federal health care law intended, the reimbursements for procedures covered under Medicaid were already relatively low. So, the clinics didn’t depend on them to keep operating, she said.
The nonprofit’s bigger concern is how Medicaid patients will get care if they can’t go to Planned Parenthood’s two clinics in South Carolina. Not all doctors accept Medicaid as insurance, and those who do often have long waits, Ringer said.
She stressed that Medicaid patients can continue visiting Planned Parenthood and using its income-based payment system to get low-cost treatments.
However, their government-provided insurance will no longer cover the visits.
Leaders for the nonprofit have vowed to continue serving patients and finding ways to challenge the governor’s decision.
The U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling last month — that patients don’t have the right to sue to see the provider of their choice — was technical. But other legal questions remain, Birdsong said.
The decision “doesn’t foreclose other possible ways to challenge the executive order,” Birdsong said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img_3704-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-24 12:56:39.299394

(Scott Olson/Getty Images)Indiana’s capital city will serve as one of five new U.S. Department of Agriculture regional hubs, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced Thursday.
“American agriculture feeds, clothes, and fuels this nation and the world, and it is long past time the Department better serve the great and patriotic farmers, ranchers, and producers we are mandated to support,” Rollins said in a news release.
The sprawling agency plans to relocate at least 2,600 employees away from the Washington, D.C. area.
“President Trump was elected to make real change in Washington, and we are doing just that by moving our key services outside the beltway and into great American cities across the country,” Rollins added.

Republican Sen. Jim Banks, Indiana’s junior U.S. senator, dubbed the announcement “huge news” for Indiana.
He led a group of Hoosier agriculture stakeholders that met with Rollins to pitch Indiana as a hub location, according to a release from his office.
“I am grateful to President Trump and Secretary Rollins for recognizing the strength and vision our state and agricultural leaders demonstrated during our meeting last month,” Banks said. “This is a win-win for Indiana and taxpayers across the country. It means real economic growth here at home and an agency that’s more efficient and focused on what matters most.”
Indiana’s senior GOP U.S. Sen. Todd Young also celebrated the news in a social media post: “Very exciting news for Hoosiers – Indianapolis has been selected as one of five new @USDA regional hub locations. Great to see these services move outside of DC and into places like Indiana that feed our nation.”
A Thursday memorandum — effective immediately — said the reorganization will align USDA’s workforce with its budget, bring the agency closer to its customers, eliminate layers of bureaucracy and consolidate redundant functions.
Reorg’s priorities
The memo called the reorganization a way to “make certain USDA can afford its workforce.”
It noted that, over the last four years, the number of employees grew by about 8%, and their salaries increased more than 14% — with the pay often backed by temporary funding.
As of Thursday, over 15,300 people have taken the agency up on its offer to quit their jobs through the deferred resignation program. The memo said USDA plans to keep “fully leverag(ing)” such voluntary programs — even though the agency had to recruit for some recently vacated key positions, National Public Radio reported.
USDA also hopes to spread its workforce out.
About 4,600 employees work within the D.C. metropolitan area, which has a high cost of living. The agency plans to relocate more than half of those employees to five hubs, keeping “no more than” 2,000 near D.C.
That would put USDA “closer to the people it serves while achieving savings to the American taxpayer,” according to the memo.
Indianapolis — Indiana’s capital city — is one of the hubs.

The others are located in Colorado, Missouri, North Carolina and Utah. All the hubs have lower cost of living than the D.C. area.
Multiple sub-agencies — like the National Agricultural Statistics Service, the Food and Nutrition Service and Natural Resources Conservation Service — have lots of regions and will consolidate into the five hubs.
“To be clear, all critical functions of the Department will continue uninterrupted,” the news release said. For example, the Forest Service will consolidate, but “will take into consideration the ongoing fire season,” according to the memo.
USDA will maintain two human resources sites in Minnesota and New Mexico, plus critical services centers and laboratories in Missouri, Montana and Nebraska. Several D.C. area buildings would be vacated.
Rollins said USDA will restructure itself  “through a transparent and common-sense process that preserves USDA’s critical health and public safety services the American public relies on.”
“We will do right by the great American people who we serve and with respect to the thousands of hardworking USDA employees who so nobly serve their country,” she said.

The ruling comes after Muscogee Freedmen have repeatedly fought for tribal recognition in and out of court alongside descendants from the Chickasaw, Choctaw and Seminole Nations.
The court ruled the tribe’s “by-blood,” language for citizenship requirements, the basis for denial of Freedmen applications, was unlawful under the 1866 treaty, which granted Freedmen citizenship status, and ruled the citizenship board must act accordingly.
“The matter is remanded to the Appellant, Citizenship Board, who is directed to apply the Treaty of 1866 and issue citizenship to the Respondents, and any other future applicant who is able to establish a lineal descendant on the Creek By Blood Dawes Roll, or the Creek Freedmen Dawes,” the ruling said.
The case was originally heard in September by a Muscogee district court judge, who ruled in favor of Freedmen descendants Rhonda Grayson and Jeff Kennedy. The pair were initially denied citizenship in 2019.
The tribe appealed the decision, throwing the case into the hands of the Muscogee Creek Supreme Court.
The Muscogee Creek Indian Freedmen Band took to social media to celebrate.
“After 46 years of disenfranchisement, we can finally reclaim our birthright as citizens of the Muscogee Creek Nation and honor our ancestors,” the statement said. “All descendants of the Creek Freedmen can now claim their birthright. We pray the ancestors are proud!”
A spokesperson for the tribe said the tribe may request to go back to court.
“We are currently reviewing the order to understand its basis as well as its implications for our processes. It may be necessary to ask for a reconsideration of this order to receive clarity so that we can ensure that we move forward in a legal, constitutional manner.”
The tribe would become the second to grant citizenship to its Freedmen after the Cherokee Nation did so in 2017.

Josh Stein’s office announced Wednesday.
The awards will fund 48 projects across 27 counties. They’ll seek to improve infrastructure, address PFAS and forever chemicals lingering in that infrastructure, replace lead pipes and improve resilience during storms.
Reid Wilson, the secretary of the Department of Environmental Quality, said in a news release Wednesday that “this funding will address aging infrastructure and improve public health for communities large and small.”
State officials received 133 total applications, requesting a total of $1.57 billion. The money comes from the state’s revolving funds, which are low-interest loans that may be partially forgiven. They’re funded by a combination of federal grants and cycling loan repayments.
Among the largest awardees are:

$35 million for the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority, to replace a wastewater treatment plant.
$20.5 million for the Fayetteville Public Works Commission, for the P.O. Hoffer/Glenville Lake Water Treatment Plant.
$13.7 million to the city of Lexington for the regional wastewater plant’s solids handling improvements project.

Another round of funding for water infrastructure projects begins later this month. Applications are due by the end of September.
And DEQ is also accepting applications — on a rolling basis — for infrastructure resilience in Hurricane Helene-impacted counties. Those projects will be funded by supplemental federal money from the federal farm bill.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-DrinkingWater-PFAS-Getty.jpg,,,2025-07-24 11:57:45.577609

(Sam Bailey/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Kansas county is asking voters in November to renew a local public safety sales tax to fund emergency and mental health crisis services, but Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach warned the county the question could violate state law.
Johnson County commissioners voted in May to approve a ballot question asking whether voters would like to renew a countywide sales tax worth a quarter of a cent for the next 10 years, beginning in 2027.
The existing sales tax, passed by voters in 2016, expires in 2027 and was used for public safety building projects, such as a new courthouse and a coroner facility.
Kobach believes the new ballot question is markedly different from the original tax proposal. He said in an opinion issued Monday at the request of Shawnee Republican Sen. Mike Thompson that the commissioners exceeded their authority.
Kansas law allows the commissioners to implement sales tax proposals, which require voter approval, to fund public safety projects “directly related to law enforcement (and necessary related programs),” Kobach wrote.
Thompson, whose district is entirely in Johnson County, asked Kobach four questions: whether state law requires the sales tax revenue to be used for both the construction and operation of public safety projects, whether mental health and emergency medical services qualify as public safety projects, if it’s proper to call the question a renewal and whether the question would be nulled if the commissioners violated any of the above.
The original 2016 ballot question said the sales tax would support “the construction and operation costs of public safety projects.” Kobach argued that the new proposal only pertains to operation costs.
“While certainly important to the county, mental health services and emergency medical services, standing alone, do not qualify,” Kobach said.
Kobach acknowledged the burden on taxpayers would be the same if the ballot question passed, “but the tax would not be funding the same projects because the new courthouse and coroner facility — the purposes for which the tax was originally passed — will have been ‘fully paid for by the time the tax expires.’ ” He said that classifying the question as a “renewal” was misleading because the new question “seeks to change the purpose” of the original tax.
“Because the proposition seeks to institute a new tax under the guise of continuing the current tax, the proposition exceeds the board’s authority, which means that it is null and void,” Kobach wrote.
The new question proposes the tax revenues fund the following: emergency medical and ambulance services, mental health crisis intervention, emergency preparedness and disaster response, the county sheriff’s office, the county jail, district courts and the district attorney’s office. Kobach said these are mostly programs, not construction or operation projects.
Kansas law doesn’t define public safety projects. Across the country, law enforcement agencies, medical personnel, first responders and social service providers have increasingly become part of the frontline effort to address mental health crises, substance use disorders and homelessness.
Johnson County staff based the decision to seek another question on a 2025 community survey, which staff said indicated support for prioritizing public safety and emergency services. Commissioners aimed this year to prioritize fiscal health. Staff also said Johnson County has a growing and aging population with evolving needs.
Mike Kelly, chairman of the board of commissioners, said at a May 8 meeting that the county, which is the wealthiest in the state, has a fundamental duty to provide public safety to its citizens.
“At the same time,” he said, “we have the not only moral obligation but the opportunity as the most prosperous county in the state of Kansas to do right by all people in Johnson County.”
The board voted 6-1 to put the question on Johnson County voters’ ballots in November.
Before the vote, members of the public criticized the board for addressing public safety over housing and homelessness efforts. Board members pushed back, arguing they could address both at once in different ways.
If passed, the sales tax is expected to generate $35 million annually. More than 28% of the tax would be paid by nonresidents, said Julie Karins, the deputy county manager, at the May 8 commission meeting.
Kobach said the county’s tax proposal wouldn’t hold up in court, but attorney general opinions do not hold the weight of law or judicial opinion.
Lisa Thurber, a spokesperson for the county, confirmed the commissioners have seen the opinion.
“While the opinion does not carry the force of law and is not binding on courts or other entities,” she said, “the Board of County Commissioners is reviewing and considering its content.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Kobach-3-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-24 11:57:45.577609

(Photo by USDA)The U.S. House Committee on Agriculture met Wednesday for a hearing and a renewed push to neutralize a California law that stipulates the living conditions of certain livestock
The law, referred to as Proposition 12, has been the subject of several lawsuits and proposed legislation as opponents say the law creates a “patchwork” of “uncertainty” in the industry.
In late June, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a case against Proposition 12. Witnesses at the House hearing said the dismissal does not equate to a ruling from the court, but instead shows the need for congressional action on the issue.
Proposition 12 was a state referendum approved in 2018 that took effect in 2024. The law stipulates meat sold in the state must comply with state animal confinement regulations, even if the animals were raised outside of California.
This means if an Iowa producer, for example, wanted to sell uncooked pork cuts into the California market, their pork must have been raised in a setting where sows had at least 24 square feet of room. Eggs would have to come from chickens that were raised with at least 1 square foot of space to comply with the California law.
Protein sold to states other than California do not need to comply, but industry leaders say the California pork market is too large to ignore.
Animal rights organizations in support of the law say the spacing stipulations would give the animals enough space to turn around freely and provide greater welfare to the animals.
Lawmakers have attempted to block the law several times. The Ending Agricultural Trade Suppression (EATS) Act in 2023 attempted to stop states from enforcing preharvest conditions on agricultural products for sale in interstate commerce settings. Opponents of the bill argued it would not only suppress Prop 12, but also interfere with many state-based agricultural laws.
Ag committee Chairman Glenn “G.T.” Thomson, said lawmakers should look instead to the language from the House’s Farm Bill proposal from last year, which did not pass. Thomson said this language was more specific and would allow rules like Prop12 to exist, but to only be enforceable on proteins raised in that state.
“In order to protect the right of American farmers and ranchers to raise their animals how they see fit, we must provide a fix for Proposition 12,” Thomson said in his opening comments.
At the Wednesday hearing, pork producers said the bigger confinements required by the law don’t always work in favor of the sows and the cost to comply with California’s law is high for producers and consumers.
Pat Hord, an Ohio pork producer and vice president of the National Pork Producers Council, has outfitted parts of his operation to be compliant with Prop 12. He said the law and the potential for the 49 other states to enact their own standards “threatens” his farm with an “unmitigated regulatory patchwork.”
Hord supported congressional action that would stop Proposition 12 and prevent future states from following suit.
An economist with NPPC who also testified Wednesday said it costs farmers $3,500 to $4,500 per sow to build compliant pens. Hord said the law is not only costly to comply with, but is “inherently less efficient.”
“All farms have or will continue to experience productivity losses under Prop 12,” Hord said to the committee. “You simply cannot house the same number of sows in the same size barn.”
Hord said the burden to comply would be even greater on small and medium sized farmers who have less capital to spend on costly upgrades. This in turn, he said, would lead to more consolidation in the pork market.
 Animal welfare

The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, or ASPCA, said in a press release that laws like Proposition 12 “challenge” the “cruel status quo” of industrial agriculture.
“Contrary to the narrative being pushed by industrial agriculture interests at today’s hearing – which notably excluded the voices of independent farmers – there are thousands of farmers across the country who support and depend on commonsense bans against the cruel confinement of farm animals,” ASPCA President and CEO Matt Bershadker said in the release. “We encourage Congress to listen to these farmers and protect state laws like Proposition 12 which create vital market opportunities for higher-welfare farming that align with the values of the American public.
ASPCA said the Senate’s recently introduced “Food Security and Farm Protection Act” was a repackaging of the EATS act and must be kept out of the upcoming Farm Bill.
The animal rights group said bills like EATS are an “unprecedented federal assault” on states’ rights to pass laws on agricultural practices and sales.
Matt Schuiteman, an Iowa pork producer and board member with Iowa Farm Bureau, said the best animal welfare comes when farmers are able to adjust their operations to their individual conditions and to their animals. This is something he said Proposition 12 would make more difficult to do.
“The most important thing I’ve learned from a lifetime of raising pigs is that it’s critical for producers to have full control over the environment in which their pigs are raised,” Schuiteman said.
He also said when breeding pigs are not confined, the social hierarchy within a herd kicks in and pigs down the pecking order are pushed away from food or water. This is not only bad for the sow, but also means she’ll have smaller litters, which hurts the farmer’s outputs.
U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, said the poor outcomes for pigs under the law show California is “clueless” about hog farming.
“This all happens because California has a liberal, progressive agenda that has no idea what farming is all about,” Feenstra said. “Let’s be clear, Prop 12 is a direct threat to our viability of family farms, the health and welfare of animals and the affordability of pork production in America.”
U.S. Rep. Jim McGovern, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said the whole hearing was a “misrepresentation of reality” and the panel of witnesses was “not a balanced panel.”
McGovern said there are “thousands” of farmers who support Proposition 12 and many small-operation producers who have benefited from the new market opportunities for “humanely raised meat” under the law.
“If you kill Prop 12, you are putting independent family farms at risk,” McGovern said. “It will be get big or get out all over again.”
Recent data from U.S. Department of Agriculture shows about 27% of U.S. hog farms already compliant with Prop 12, or are in the process of becoming compliant with the law.
The data, according to an analysis from Politico, said pork prices in California are nearly 20% higher than they were this time last year.
Lilly Rocha, executive director of the Latino Restaurant Association, said these higher prices impact small family businesses in the state, make it more difficult for consumers to buy pork or pork products, which distances Latino customers from their cultural heritage.
 GOP governors support rollback of Prop 12

Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, along with seven GOP governors, submitted a letter to members of Congress Wednesday, urging them to support the Save Our Bacon act, introduced earlier in the day by U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson of Iowa.
Hinson, in a social media post on X, said the bill would “push back on California’s radical Prop 12.”
The letter from state governors called the California regulations “arbitrary” and “out of touch,” especially as it drives up production prices across the country and consumer pork prices in the state.
“When one state decides to regulate another, federal legislation is appropriate and necessary,” the letter said. “We ask that Congress make clear that each state may regulate livestock production within its own borders, but not the production of livestock in other states.”
In addition to Reynolds, the letter was signed by governors from Mississippi, Indiana, Nebraska, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma and Virginia.
The Trump administration has also sued the State of California and its officials for the impact the law has had on egg prices in the state. This lawsuit came shortly after the Supreme Court’s dismissal.
In closing, Thompson said the courts have shown “this is a responsibility Congress has to fix.”
“This committee will consider a measured correction that preserves states’ rights to control their internal agriculture practices,” Thompson said. “We’ll protect interstate commerce and preserve states’ animal health regulations and laws.”

(Photo via Rep. Jared Golden)Before the U.S. House of Representatives departed early for its August break on Tuesday, 209 members joined an effort to attempt to force a vote on a bill that would nullify President Donald Trump’s executive order stripping union rights from about two-thirds of the federal workforce — but that’s nine short of the needed threshold. 
In light of the Republican majority so far declining to bring Maine Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden’s Protect America’s Workforce Act up for a floor vote, Golden last week introduced a discharge petition, which if endorsed by 218 members would force a vote on the bill.
Maine’s other representative, Democrat Chellie Pingree, signed the discharge petition the day Golden introduced it. So far, only two Republicans have endorsed it — Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, who introduced the bill with Golden, and bill cosponsor Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska  — though the bill has seven GOP co-sponsors out of its total 222.
“The House is now on recess until September, but Congressman Golden will continue working, in solidarity with the one million workers across the country whose collective bargaining rights were stripped by Trump’s executive order, to ensure the House takes action to restore workers’ rights,” his spokesperson said.
Golden attempting to force vote to restore federal worker union rights revoked by Trump

Trump’s executive order on March 27 banned collective bargaining agreements at government agencies with “national security interests.” These include the Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Environmental Protection Agency, among numerous others, overall impacting about two-thirds of the federal workforce. 
The White House said in a fact sheet that accompanied the order that “certain federal unions have declared war on President Trump’s agenda” and that the order was necessary to safeguard American interests. 
A coalition of unions sued shortly after but, as of the latest decision issued last week, a federal appeals court allowed the Trump administration to proceed with implementing the executive order.
While the House is taking a break, union members will not be. 
The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations plans to mobilize its members in the districts of representatives who have not signed the discharge petition, said Mia Jacobs, the union’s director of media relations.
That organizing across the country has already begun. On Monday, the group’s “Better in a Union” bus tour stop in Pittsburg concluded with a call to action for attendees to reach out to their members of Congress to sign the discharge petition.
“The collective bargaining executive order was the single biggest act of union busting in our history,” Jacobs said, “Union members understand the stakes of this, that if they can strip federal workers of their collective bargaining rights then the contracts for a million more workers are at risk, so this is something that is existential to the labor movement.” 
While the discharge petition still needs more support, Jacobs said the current endorsements and the 222 bipartisan co-sponsors of the bill show the issue has broad support. This is also mostly true of the general public, as polls show about 70% of Americans approve of labor unions, cutting across party lines.  
The discharge petition will start with the 209 signatures when the House returns in September and remain active as long as the underlying bill is, so for the whole Congress that is slated to end in early 2027.

The appeals judges ruled 2-1 that Trump’s order, issued on Inauguration Day, violates the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which states “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.”
“One power that the President was not granted, by Article II or by any other source, is the power to modify or change any clause of the United States Constitution,” Judge Ronald Gould, a Clinton appointee, wrote in his opinion.
Gould’s opinion, joined by Judge Michael Hawkins, sides with U.S. District Court Judge John Coughenour who stopped Trump’s order with an indefinite preliminary injunction in February. Such orders block enforcement while the case proceeds through the courts.
Coughenour called Trump’s order “blatantly unconstitutional.” The lawsuit was brought by Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Illinois and two pregnant noncitizen women who feared their children could be born without citizenship in any country.
In a statement, Washington Attorney General Nick Brown applauded the appeals court ruling.
“The court agrees that the president cannot redefine what it means to be American with the stroke of a pen,” Brown said. “He cannot strip away the rights, liberties, and protections of children born in our country.”
The decision from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals adds to the list of courts that have found Trump’s move unconstitutional and blocked enforcement of it. The ruling comes after the Department of Justice and Washington attorney general’s office argued the case in early June.
Since those arguments, the U.S. Supreme Court decided judges like Coughenour had overstepped their authority in blocking Trump’s order nationwide. The justices ruled nationwide injunctions should be limited to when necessary to “provide complete relief to each plaintiff.”
The high court’s decision left the door open for a checkerboard of states where birthright citizenship remained and others where it didn’t.
The Supreme Court’s decision didn’t take up the merits of Trump’s order.
Wednesday’s ruling is the second to confirm a complete block is necessary since the Supreme Court decision, after a New Hampshire federal judge certified a nationwide class action suit.
The Trump administration looks to define “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” as only covering people whose primary allegiance is to the United States. So people born to parents only here temporarily or without legal status wouldn’t qualify for citizenship at birth.
In 2022, about 153,000 babies across the country were born to two parents without legal immigration status, according to the plaintiffs. The states have said they stand to lose federal funding through programs like Medicaid that otherwise could help these children if they were citizens.
Gould found this argument persuasive, justifying “complete relief” to block the order nationwide. He wrote that Trump’s birthright citizenship order would require states to overhaul their eligibility verification systems for social service programs.
“The preliminary injunction here merely prevents the Executive Branch from denying citizenship to individuals who are likely constitutionally entitled to citizenship,” Gould wrote. “Because, as the district court correctly concluded, the Executive Branch does not have a legitimate interest in violating the Constitution, the Executive Branch has not shown that either the public interest or the balance of equities tips in its favor.”
Judge Patrick Bumatay, a Trump appointee, disagreed, arguing the states lack standing to bring litigation over the order because their financial loss would be a “self-inflicted injury” if they choose to provide benefits to immigrants without legal status.
In his dissent, Bumatay didn’t address the issue of the injunction’s scope.

The ramifications could be particularly devastating in Mississippi, one of the most federally dependent states in the country.
The law limits eligibility for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, through which about a quarter of a million Mississippians with children receive food assistance. The policy also cuts the federal contribution to Medicaid, the country’s largest insurer of children, and creates a tax credit program that doles out private-school scholarships.
Here’s more about how the federal law will impact Mississippi students, teachers and families. 
Tax credit private school voucher program
A new program created by the law will allow Mississippians to contribute up to $1,700 to an organization that awards scholarships to private school students starting in 2027, and donors will be given a break on their taxes equal to the amount they contribute. 
It’s a dollar-for-dollar tax credit — about three times as much as people receive from donating to a children’s hospital or other causes. 
The program is a huge win for school choice proponents in Mississippi — or “education freedom,” as House Speaker Jason White and others call it. He said the issue will be his top priority going into the 2026 legislative session. 
But it’s a loss for the state’s public schools, said Nancy Loome, executive director of The Parents’ Campaign, a public education advocacy group.
“This is absolutely intended to shift public money into private schools,” she said. “This is the federal government reimbursing taxpayers for payments to private schools. It’s a kind of money laundering.”
Douglas Carswell, president of the Mississippi Center for Public Policy, calls that a “Pavlovian response” from school choice opponents. 
“It’s not money that would have ever gone into the public education system in the first place,” he said. “It doesn’t apply because the dollars weren’t in the public school system to begin with.” 
Loome said the program could also lead to private schools increasing tuition. It’s a risk that Carswell doesn’t deny, but says is unlikely given the eligibility criteria for the vouchers. 
However, the eligibility criteria is generous — to qualify for vouchers, you can earn up to 300% of the area’s median income. That’s six-figures in Mississippi, or about $150,000, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. 
That’s in line with research that shows a majority of private school vouchers across the country go to students who could already afford and were attending private schools. 
“It’s clear that these programs benefit wealthier, more affluent families,” Loome said. “Students in the public schools are the ones who will be left with fewer resources.”
The first step for implementing the optional program in Mississippi: The state must choose to participate. It’s likely, given powerful Republican state leaders’ support of school choice initiatives. Then, Carswell suspects we’ll see an increase in scholarship-granting organizations — the groups that will disburse these vouchers, whose sole purpose must be doing so. Ace Scholars is one such organization with an established presence in Mississippi, he said. 
Mississippi currently only provides private school vouchers for students with disabilities.
“In Mississippi, we are finally getting to the place where we’re recognized for student achievement in our public schools,” Loome said. “It makes no sense for us to embrace a program that will take our students backwards.”
Federal money for workforce training
Another portion of the law in line with education movements in Mississippi: The ability to use federal grants to pay for short-term workforce training.
Low-income students who qualify for federal Pell Grants can use a Workforce Pell Grant on certain weeks-long training programs for skilled jobs starting next school year. 
Scott Waller, president of the Mississippi Economic Council, said the change will have a positive impact in Mississippi, where state leaders have been advocating for more career and technical education opportunities for students. The push comes at a critical time, as Republican state leaders tout the state’s economic growth. 
“Are you getting an education that’s tied to employment? That’s the key,” Waller said. “If that happens, it’s going to change the trajectory of a lot of lives in Mississippi.”
Education officials, too, have turned an eye to career and technical education starting in high school, so Waller said the timing of the federal Pell Grant changes couldn’t be better. 
“The model we have right now is so geared to the academic side — not that that’s not important — but this is one more step to making connections between the needs of our students and the needs of our companies,” he said. “This is a step forward.”
Free school meals may be affected
Trump’s legislation will create more work requirements for parents to qualify for the SNAP program, which may decrease the number of students getting free school meals. 
That could have a domino effect on how many schools meet the federal threshold to provide free meals for all students. 
While parents can still fill out paperwork at their child’s school for free meals if they are removed from SNAP rolls, it’s sometimes difficult to get them to do so, according to Amanda Williams, the incoming president for the Mississippi School Nutrition Association.
“We communicate and communicate, but it’s still hard to get parents to do it,” she said. “And if they have other things to pay for, like the light bill, they’re not going to think about sending a dollar with their child for lunch. We’re going to feed our babies anyway at the school, but those students will accumulate a bill that just gets higher and higher.”
Williams said she knows of schools in south Mississippi with upwards of $30,000 in school lunch debt. 
About one in four children in Mississippi face food insecurity. And because the state is so rural, Williams said, there’s a greater burden on schools to feed children. 
“Our students are not able to just walk down the street around the corner to a local restaurant or cafeteria or fast food,” she said. “If you have parents who work all day, the kid can get home and they’re still hungry. They will have to wait until their parents get home to eat.”
Hunger has a direct impact on student learning. Williams has seen it firsthand as assistant director of child nutrition at Meridian Public Schools. 
“I mingle with students in the morning, and when they come in, you can look at their faces and see that they are hungry,” she said. “But once they come in, get their breakfast and start eating, their attitude changes.
“If our children aren’t eating, then they’re not going to excel in school like we want them to.”
According to health policy expert John Dillon Harris, who also studies nutrition, the state could be paying approximately $140 million more annually on SNAP, thanks to changes in the federal spending package. 
The legislation makes states responsible for 75% of the administrative costs associated with SNAP instead of half, and the state could also be picking up millions in SNAP benefit costs. 
Additionally, the law prohibits immigrants from receiving SNAP benefits unless they are classified as “lawful permanent residents.” 
Ramped up immigration enforcement
Immigration enforcement is getting an influx of cash under the president’s spending legislation — an additional $31 billion for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and $13 billion for states and local communities.
If children’s families are affected by deportations or arrests, they may require more support in school. 
ICE raids in 2017 and 2019 in Jackson left lasting trauma among students, teachers said, who required extra counseling at school. 
“The students went home and their parents weren’t there, so the schools had to come to their aid,” said L. Patricia Ice, director of the Mississippi Immigrant Rights Alliance.
In the event of arrest, Ice encouraged parents to create family preparation plans — which include talking to children about who will care for them in parents’ absence, keeping contact information up-to-date in schools and designating a trusted individual as a guardian. 
Medicaid spending on student services
While the federal spending law makes historic Medicaid cuts, experts say the direct impact on Mississippi schools is minimal because the state hasn’t expanded Medicaid.
In Mississippi, the state Medicaid agency pays for certain services in schools for students with disabilities, including speech, occupational and physical therapists, so those school-based services will not be impacted by the federal changes.
Federal funding to state Medicaid divisions will decrease under the legislation, though, so the Mississippi agency may make its own changes.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/03155743/3X0A3280.jpg,,,2025-07-24 10:56:35.144828

NEWARK — One of Newark’s tastiest summer traditions is coming of age.
The Downtown Newark Food and Brew Festival returns for its 21st year on Saturday, July 26, transforming the city’s central business district into a hub of culinary and craft beer celebration.
Running from noon to 7 p.m., the festival will feature more than 45 craft and imported beers paired with inventive dishes at 10 participating restaurants.
Organized by Out & About Magazine in partnership with The Newark Partnership (TNP), the event is a pay-as-you-go experience, encouraging attendees to explore and enjoy Newark’s diverse dining scene at their own pace.

“The Newark Partnership is always happy to sponsor Food & Brew,” said Ali DeAngelis, interim executive director at TNP. “This year we even get to privilege to celebrate it’s 21 st year. As someone who celebrated their 21 st birthday at Santa Fe and Deer Park Tavern, this year’s festival feels extra special.”
Adding to the festivities, downtown retailers will offer special deals as part of the Hops & Shops Sidewalk Sale, making the day a win for both food lovers and shoppers.
The first 2,000 attendees will receive a commemorative mug, and the popular Food & Brew Passport returns—offering the chance to win gift certificates by collecting stamps at five or more venues.
“The Newark Food &amp; Brew has become a rite of summer,” said Jerry duPhily, publisher of Out & About Magazine. “When we partnered with the City of Newark to create this event more than 20 years ago, craft-beer focused events were a novelty. Today, they’re commonplace. But the beauty of this event is that it encourages guests to explore Newark and visit the many participating restaurants. It’s an ideal showcase for the city’s dining scene.”

Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City).
The Great Lakes Icebreaker Act of 2025 passed on July 16, and was the first bill written by McDonald Rivet to advance in the chamber. McDonald Rivet celebrated its passage in a statement released Wednesday. 
“The Great Lakes are our country’s most valuable natural resources and are a critical part of Michigan’s economy and way of life. We need to make sure it stays that way,” McDonald Rivet said. “We brought Democrats and Republicans together to support these efforts that will help protect Michigan jobs and commerce while also ensuring the safety of everyone on the water.”
The bill also instructs the Coast Guard to analyze its current icebreaking fleet.
Another priority for McDonald Rivet also passed recently, which is a provision requiring the Coast Guard to study the impact of reduced search-and-rescue operations at the Saginaw River station and others after around the clock operations were cut last year. McDonald Rivet championed the reinstating of that capability during a recent meeting of the U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.

Andrew D. Martire will step down as Head of School at The Tatnall School at the end of the 2025-26 academic year, the school announced Wednesday.
Martire, who has led the Wilmington-based independent school since 2020, has accepted a new position in his home state of Maryland.
“Andy has led with integrity, vision, and a deep commitment to our mission,” said Abby Mrozinski, president of the Tatnall School Board of Trustees. “We are grateful for all he has done to move the school forward and know that we will continue to benefit from his legacy now and into the future.”
The school’s board of trustees has begun the process of identifying a successor.
Martire’s tenure at Tatnall was marked by significant developments, including guiding the school through the COVID-19 pandemic, boosting academic and athletic programs, and overseeing several major campus upgrades.

Among the projects completed under his leadership are the Ederic Learning Commons, the Eco-Courtyard, renovated athletic locker rooms, and a new Early Childhood building.
He also collaborated closely with the board to implement “Tatnall at Its Best,” a strategic plan aimed at strengthening the school as it approaches its 100th anniversary in 2030.
Martire plans to remain in his role through the coming academic year.
His departure comes at a time of strong momentum for Tatnall, according to school officials.
The school recently posted record enrollment numbers for 2024-25, and Tatnall’s athletic program was ranked as the top independent school program in Delaware. More than a third of the Class of 2025 have committed to play NCAA sports.
“These accomplishments are exciting and are a testament to Andy’s leadership as well as the outstanding Tatnall leadership, faculty, and staff,” Mrozinski said. “We envision a future rooted in academic excellence, a vibrant community, and an emphasis on innovation. Our efforts will continue uninterrupted, building on our momentum to encourage Tatnall’s growth and success through our 2030 centennial and beyond.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-9.59.54-AM.png,,,2025-07-24 10:56:35.144828

Sussex County officials are investigating a wastewater discharge issue at the South Coastal Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility near Bethany Beach after discovering a compromised pipe diverted treated effluent into a nearby tax ditch.
The problem was reported to the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) on Saturday, July 19, after Environmental Services staff identified the diversion from the facility’s outflow pipe.
The pipe typically carries treated wastewater about a mile offshore into the Atlantic Ocean.

Instead, a portion of that flow was found discharging into a ditch near the Assawoman Canal.
Officials say the discharge involves treated effluent that has been sanitized to remove waste particles and other impurities.
While it’s still unclear how long the diversion has been occurring or the total volume affected, early estimates suggest less than 10 percent of the facility’s treated water was diverted.
Sussex County Administrator Todd F. Lawson emphasized the county’s commitment to safe and responsible wastewater management.
“Ordinarily, our operation runs seamlessly, treating millions of gallons of waste daily without incident. Unfortunately, however, sometimes technical issues and equipment failures happen,” he said. “But our staff works diligently to identify and correct any issues that might arise, working alongside our State partners, so that we are compliant and providing the best possible service.”
According to the county, initial testing of the discharged water indicates it meets quality standards outlined in the facility’s state-issued permit.
DNREC has not issued any public health warnings or environmental advisories related to the incident.
County officials say repairs are underway and they continue to work closely with state environmental regulators to monitor the situation.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-9.49.52-AM.png,,,2025-07-24 09:56:26.699491

Whatley is expected to launch his campaign within the next week and will have the blessing of President Donald Trump, POLITICO first reported Thursday.
Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law who was born in Wilmington and had been mulling a campaign, has reportedly declined to run for the seat currently held by U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, who is not running for re-election.
Cooper, a Democrat, will reportedly launch a campaign in the coming days.
Both candidates are expected to largely clear the field of any major primary opponents. Whatley, a well-connected leader backed by the president, and Cooper, a prolific fundraiser and high-profile former governor, will both be immediate favorites for their parties’ nominations.
Former U.S. Rep. Wiley Nickel, a Democrat, is also running for the open seat. Republicans Andy Nilsson and Don Brown have also launched campaigns.
Democrats, in statements Thursday, focused on Trump’s declining to run for the seat.

SPP works[...],"Staff in Southwest Power Pool's coordination center continuously monitor the power grid, weather conditions and other factors that affect the delivery of electricity. (Southwest Power Pool) TOPEKA — High temperatures this week drew a caution from the regional organization that ensures reliability of the power grid and led Evergy to ask some customers to conserve energy usage.
The Southwest Power Pool is one of nine regional transmission organizations approved by federal regulators to support reliable power supplies and infrastructure. SPP works with energy companies to make sure that when customers set their thermostat, they  soon hear the answering hum of the air conditioner.
SPP issued a low-level weather advisory for Tuesday through Thursday, warning of hot weather, said spokeswoman Meghan Sever.
“This is because of the high temperatures, and while it does include Kansas, a weather advisory does not require the public to conserve energy,” she said.
Such a situation isn’t unusual during hot Kansas summers. In fact, Kansas City meteorologist Joe Lauria vented on Facebook that people are using “extreme” too often in describing weather.
“What used to be an ‘excessive’ heat warning has been replaced with the phrase ‘extreme,’ ” he wrote. “I can sort of get behind that in the ‘extreme’ sense IF something extreme was going to happen, but what’s ahead, at least into Monday is NORMAL HEAT. 90-95° days are NORMAL for us in the hottest part of the year. We average around 40 days/year of 90°+ days, and YES they’re supposed to be humid and YES we’re supposed to have heat indices 100°-105°+ seemingly every day.”
This week was initially supposed to see temps spike over 100 degrees. Still, even with staying in the 90s across the state, the load on the power grid gets intense.
On Wednesday, Evergy reached out to residential and business customers that signed up to be part of its demand response program to manage that load.
That program asks willing customers to curtail their energy load, said Evergy spokeswoman Courtney Lewis.
“Business customers may participate in a variety of ways, which may include turning off lights, changing their production process, increasing temperature at their facilities, or using back-up generation,” she said in an email.
Washburn University, a large-load user, sent a campuswide email telling staff to adapt building temperatures.
An email from Lori Hutchinson, executive director of strategic communications and marketing, asked Washburn staff in most campus buildings to turn up thermostats from 74 to 80 degrees between 2 and 6 p.m. Wednesday.
Washburn participates in Evergy’s Generation Substitution Service, a special tariff for larger customers in Evergy’s Kansas Central territory, Lewis said.
Those customers are willing to switch to back-up generation when Evergy asks them, she said.
Evergy works with customers willing to adapt their energy use during high-use times, and customers receive a break in their rates, the company’s website said.
“It’s been interesting — a lot of the largest customers have not been motivated by the demand response piece, notwithstanding the potential rate benefits for them,” said David Campbell, Evergy president and CEO, in a Monday Kansas Corporation Commission hearing. “I’m sure that will be a dialogue that continues over time.”
Campbell said the number of times that Evergy needs to call on customers to interrupt their energy usage is low, although the program does require flexibility.
“I think that the range of opportunities of large customers bringing solutions to be more proactive in how you think about demand-response is a way that we can meet the moment historically,” he said.
The summer seasonal forecast this year showed a 40-60% chance of higher temperatures than usual across the SPP territory, Sever said. The organization uses various tools and systems to mitigate risk.
“Under different scenarios, like when we experience higher-than-normal temperatures that drive increased load, we may call on generating units to commit to run earlier or more often than usual, delay planned outages, import energy from neighboring systems or tap into available reserves, depending on the severity and duration of events affecting energy reliability,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SPP-Coordination-Center-01-APPROVED-FOR-EXTERNAL-DISTRIBUTION-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-24 09:56:26.699491

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)The lawyer in a federal tug-of-war over who should helm the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New Jersey said she’s ready to serve as judges have ordered, deepening the division between the courts and the White House over who will be the Garden State’s next top federal prosecutor.
Desiree Leigh Grace was second-in-command to the acting U.S. attorney — Alina Habba — and a nine-year veteran of the office when a federal panel of judges on Tuesday announced they’d chosen her to replace Habba, President Donald Trump’s former personal attorney whose four-month tenure as interim U.S. Attorney has been rocky.
“The District Judges for the District of New Jersey selected me to serve as the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey. It will forever be the greatest honor that they selected me on merit, and I’m prepared to follow that Order and begin to serve in accordance with the law,” Grace wrote on LinkedIn Wednesday.
Grace’s statement was first reported by the New Jersey Globe.
Trump had nominated Habba for a full term last month. But federal law gives district judges the power to name a U.S. attorney if the Senate does not act on a president’s nominee within 120 days. The Senate has not acted, and Habba’s 120-day term ends Friday.
The White House said Tuesday Trump still wants Habba to remain in the post, and Attorney General Pamela Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche defended her on social media, announcing they had “removed” Grace and complaining that the judges had gone “rogue.”
The administration had not yet commented Thursday morning on Grace’s vow to follow the judges’ order.
Grace noted she’d served under both Democratic and Republican administrations.
“I’ve been promoted four times in the last five years by both — including four months ago by this administration. Politics never impacted my work at the Department,” Grace wrote.
New Jersey’s senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, issued statements earlier this week congratulating Grace and condemning the Trump administration for firing her. The two men, both Democrats, have objected to Habba taking the job permanently, accusing her of using the office to pursue “frivolous and politically motivated prosecutions.”

Mike Dunleavy on education funding on Friday, Jan. 31, 2025. (Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)The state of Alaska has filed an appeal with the U.S. Department of Education after federal officials said the state failed a test measuring the differences in funding between school districts, which put more than $80.8 million in federal aid at risk.
Each year, the state receives federal funding called “impact aid” intended to compensate districts with federally owned lands, which reduce the tax base to support schools. The state can put that funding toward its own funding for schools — which the state has done in the past — but only if it can pass what’s known as a disparity test. 
Federal law requires there to be no more than a 25% gap between per-student revenue in districts near the highest in funding and districts near the lowest. The department found Alaska’s disparity to be 26.88%, given the state’s complex funding formula. 
But Alaska has rejected the finding, filing a formal appeal on July 14 and submitting districts’ finance data to argue their expenditures meet the standard. The test puts federal funding at stake, according to the state, which this year amounts to an estimated $80.8 million.
Deena Bishop, commissioner of the Alaska Department of Education and Early Development, said in an interview last week that she feels good about the state’s accounting and a successful appeal.
“I’m confident that we did meet it,” Bishop said of the requirements. “If I base it off of the last appeal and how Alaska was able to share how transportation costs are truly that disparate, then I think we will do fine.”
The state failed the same disparity test in 2021, based on 2019 state data, and successfully appealed. This time, the state submitted 2024 data for evaluation. 
“So a little bit of it is a huge math problem at the beginning,” Bishop said of the appeal process. “We wrapped our arms around it and figured that out, and then made an argument on … why we did it that way, given the background of those costs in Alaska.” 
Bishop said Alaska sees high costs in rural school districts — especially for transportation, but also basic supplies and operating costs. 
“The cost to do business is highly diverse in Alaska. If you just took the cost of a head of lettuce or a gallon of milk, you know, in Anchorage, as compared to Teller, it’s not just three times (higher in Teller). It could be up to five times. And really building and construction materials, supplies, all of those are such a significant increase due to the way you can only get in by barge or plane. So it’s just … again, understanding why we pay such large differences in different places in Alaska.”
The U.S. Department of Education notified the state that it failed the test on May 16, as first reported by KTOO. Bishop said it will take time to resolve. The 2021 appeal was resolved at the end of that fiscal year, in 2022. 
“It is a long process, because I think they’re very careful at it,” she said. “You want to spend the time on it. They did spend the time to understand Alaska.”
In the meantime, the federal impact aid payments will continue to school districts.
DEED spokesperson Bryan Zadalis said by email those funds will continue through the appeal process. “School districts will continue to receive Impact Aid funding directly from US-ED through their regular processes of application approval and funding availability,” he said.
Added uncertainty for education funding
The results of the disparity tests add uncertainty for the state, and for Alaska schools.  
That’s based on the state’s complex funding formula for schools – which includes federal, state and local contributions. 
Alexei Painter, who directs the division of state government that analyzes the budget for the Legislature, said the Legislature passed a budget that funds whatever the state’s portion is in that funding formula. If the state passes the disparity test, it allows the state to deduct the federal impact aid dollars from the state school funding.
But if the state fails the test, Painter said, “that money doesn’t go away. It just goes directly to those districts.”
If the federal impact aid isn’t flowing through the state government, it no longer is distributed based on the state funding formula. That’s potentially a big problem for the state.
“If we fail, we can’t make that deduction,” Painter said in an interview Wednesday. “The result of that is that what the state would owe to pay the full formula would go up by $80 million.” 
That’s because the state would still be required to distribute the remaining state aid according to formula, but it would have less revenue to do it. 
Painter explained that the issue is further complicated by Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s budget veto of $50 million for the state’s education funding this year. 
Under the original budget bill passed by the Legislature, the state had an open-ended commitment to provide school funding according to the formula. But in issuing the veto, Dunleavy crossed out the language, replacing it with a dollar amount.
“The governor vetoed that appropriation from an open-ended one to a fixed dollar amount,” Painter said. That means that if the state fails the disparity test, “that cost goes up by $80 million, and now the veto impact is $130 million.”
The Legislature is set to take a vote on whether to override Dunleavy’s veto of school funding during a special session, scheduled for Aug. 2. 
Painter said that if the Legislature votes to override the veto, it would fund the education formula – including the $80.8 million. 
Depending on the override vote and the appeal, the impacts to school districts could vary widely across the state, he said. The division issued a memo in June on the potential impacts.
Some districts that receive the federal impact aid because they include federal lands, like the Lower Kuskokwim or Fairbanks school districts, could see millions more. But others, like the Matanuska-Susitna or Anchorage districts could see millions less, as the state would not have enough money to fully balance its part in the funding formula. 
“I would just assume the Legislature will address this in some way,” Painter said. A veto override would be one way to address it. Another way would be to provide more money for school districts after the Legislature reconvenes for its next regular session, in January, in a supplemental budget bill. 
If the state loses its appeal and the Legislature doesn’t act, it could be a problem for districts. 
“Otherwise there’s just a lot of uncertainty for districts,” Painter said. “Even if the department’s ultimately successful, in the meantime, it just adds uncertainty for districts.”
Sen. Löki Tobin, D-Anchorage and chair of the Senate Education Committee, said in a phone interview that she was glad the state has appealed. But she argued that the disparity is being driven by a lack of funding on the state’s part for public schools. 
“That is ultimately on the shoulders of our state and also of our local communities, and with a decade of flat funding, it is clear why our school districts’ budgets are getting tighter, the deficits are getting larger,” and the disparity is growing, Tobin said.

As American troops withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021 and the Taliban regained control of the country, hundreds of thousands of Afghans fled to the U.S. California housed more of these immigrants than any other state, but they remain imperiled as President Donald Trump’s administration strips away legal protections and support, writes CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff.
Nearly 200,000 Afghans arrived in the U.S. in 2021 under President Joe Biden. California had more than 58,000 Afghan immigrants in 2023, with Sacramento and Alameda counties having the largest populations in the country. 
Many of those arrivals had helped the U.S. government in its 20-year war against Afghanistan, rendering them and their families particularly vulnerable to Taliban retribution. Some Afghan immigrants at the time were granted humanitarian parole while they applied for asylum or visas, and many are still trying to bring over family members located elsewhere. 
But since Trump’s return to the White House, his administration has paused all refugee admissions, including those that were already approved. Trump has also banned Afghan citizens from entering the U.S., and the administration in April said it would not renew deportation protections for Afghan immigrants, which ended July 14.
Trump also canceled foreign aid that funded resettlement agencies in the U.S., and the administration plans to shut down the office that coordinates relocation efforts for Afghans. The federal budget bill passed earlier this month imposes new immigration fees and eliminates access to health care and food benefits for applicants.
Though California’s budget includes $10 million for immigration legal services and the state operates a program supported by federal funding to help Afghan refugees, its resources remain limited. Two bills to establish an agency for immigrant and refugee affairs and expand resettlement services have also stalled in the Legislature.

A.T., an Afghan asylum seeker: “The Afghans paid a very high price. People lost their loved ones. They lost parts of their bodies. Please do not forget Afghans who fought with you in the war against terror. Whenever you give some final decision about the status, please consider the facts.”

Fire relief fund could go up in smoke

The nine-member California Catastrophe Response Council — which includes Gov. Gavin Newsom, as well as the state’s treasurer and insurance commissioner — is meeting today in Sacramento to discuss updates about the deadly Eaton Fire that erupted in January. 
In addition to deliberating on the ongoing investigation of the fire’s cause, the council is expected to go over the fire’s potential effect on a $21 billion state wildfire fund, reports the Los Angeles Times.
Lawmakers created the fund after 2018’s Camp Fire to protect utility companies from bankruptcy from future wildfires they cause. Southern California Edison is currently under investigation for the Eaton Fire. Though the probe has not yet concluded, the utility said Wednesday that it plans to launch a compensation program for victims. 
If the utility is found liable, the state wildfire fund could be fully drained to reimburse the company. Insured property losses alone have been estimated to be worth at least $15.2 billion, according to the Times.
Of the 1,736 adults surveyed in the latest Public Policy Institute of California poll released Wednesday evening, 82% say the threat of wildfires in their California region is a problem and 63% say that the state and local governments aren’t doing enough to address wildfires.



Cal State budget woes continue

At its bimonthly board of trustees meeting Tuesday, California State University said it faces a $164 million budget shortfall for this year, writes CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn.
This marks the third year in a row that the nation’s largest public four-year university system is unable to fully afford itself. The budget gap, which has grown by $775 million since 2023 to a total of $2.3 billion, does not include the multibillion-dollar maintenance blacklog it needs to fix buildings and carry out repairs.
With its $9 billion operating budget, the costs for Cal State’s labor, energy and education continue to rise. Lawmakers passed a state budget this year that cut the university system’s funding by $144 million. Cal State can take an interest-free loan from the state to make up for the cut, and lawmakers pledged to restore the cut next year.
To mitigate its budget woes, Cal State in the past two years slashed more than 1,200 jobs, reduced student support staff and eliminated 1,400 courses. A 6% increase on annual tuition also began last year, with another 5% increase beginning next fall.

The Trump administration’s tax bill will likely hit hardest in the state’s Gateway Cities, which are home to a disproportionate share of the state’s immigrants and low-income population, as work requirements and Medicaid eligibility checks ramp up. Here's how Gateway City leaders are responding.
The post ‘We are terrified’: Gateway City leaders prepare for[...]","After months of nationwide uncertainty over looming threats to Medicaid, a clearer — but still murky — road now lies ahead for public health leaders across the Commonwealth. Over 300,000 Massachusetts residents — nearly 5 percent of the state’s population — are expected to lose Medicaid coverage by 2034 under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.  
The sweeping changes will likely hit hardest the state’s Gateway Cities, which are home to a disproportionate share of the state’s immigrants and low-income population, as work requirements and eligibility checks ramp up. During a 2023 Medicaid enrollment purge, MassHealth — the state’s Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program — identified 15 “priority communities” that officials believed had the most residents at risk of losing coverage — 13 of which were Gateway Cities.  
Some Gateway City leaders say they expect to take on the burden of educating enrollees, keeping them insured under new requirements, and helping disadvantaged communities navigate the approaching changes to MassHealth.  
For now, these communities are doing the best they can to prepare for the thousands of residents expected to lose health coverage while they wait for more guidance from the state. Some are coordinating with their local or regional health centers and hospitals, while others are organizing targeted outreach and relying on community ties. 
President Trump and Congressional Republicans’ reconciliation bill, signed into law on July 4, calls for non-disabled adult recipients under 65 to work, train, or volunteer for at least 80 hours per month starting as early as January 2027. Eligibility checks will be required every six months instead of yearly. Many immigrants with legal status will no longer be eligible, including refugees, people granted asylum, and certain abused spouses, children, and trafficking victims.   
“We are being forced to do things that really shouldn’t fall on local government,” said Chelsea City Manager Fidel Maltez. “We are terrified, because we have seen it time and time again. When the federal government does not step in, residents show up at our doorstep. They ask for help, and we’re in the front lines.” 
Elvira Pinjic, executive director of the Joint Committee for Children’s Healthcare in Everett, runs a team of certified health insurance navigators that operates rent-free out of Everett City Hall and works closely with the city to provide education and assistance to low-income residents. Nearly 47 percent of the city is foreign-born, which is significantly higher than the state average of 18 percent. More than 15 percent of residents had an income below the poverty level in 2023.  
Requiring enrollees to re-up their eligibility twice a year means “double the work,” Pinjic said. Once they receive more guidance from the state on what kinds of paperwork will be required, the team plans to use their database to reach out to MassHealth enrollees via WhatsApp, social media, and other avenues to answer questions, offer help, and send reminders. They are also partnering with churches throughout the city to spread the word about significant changes to MassHealth. 
“You would go to your city hall first, before you go anywhere else,” Pinjic said. “They’re not going to go to the state … they will come to us to ask these questions.”  
Work and reporting requirements have been shown to confuse enrollees and have resulted in eligible members losing their coverage due to paperwork problems. (For example, more than 18,000 adults in Arkansas lost coverage after the state established a work reporting requirement in 2018 that lasted just 10 months. Most adults on Medicaid under the age of 65 are working full or part-time already, unless they are inhibited by school, caregiving responsibilities, illness or disability, according to KFF, a nonprofit health policy research and polling organization. 
“The most marginalized are the ones who are not going to be able to do this,” said Dr. Mattie Castiel, Worcester’s commissioner of health and human services. “I can’t tell you how many people just forget to re-up their MassHealth. They’re not going to meet those requirements.”  
Between April 2023 and 2024, around 362,000 people were dropped from MassHealth in a period of post-pandemic eligibility redetermination. Two-thirds lost their coverage due to providing insufficient information, according to the Executive Office of Health and Human Services. 
Worcester City Hall now serves as an “unlocked front door” for those with questions about coverage, according to Castiel, and they plan to conduct more outreach by bringing information directly into the communities that will be most affected. They often rely on local philanthropic organizations to do this work, but that help can only go so far. “Everybody’s going to be knocking at the same door.”

Nearly 21 percent of Worcester residents had an income below the poverty level in 2023, and over 23 percent of residents were born outside of the country. Staff and residents alike “feel that stress and anxiety about what’s next,” Castiel said. 
Beginning Jan. 1, 2026, low-income immigrants in the five-year waiting period before they can qualify for Medicaid will no longer be eligible for tax credits and cost-sharing reductions when buying health insurance on the Affordable Care Act’s Health Insurance Marketplace. 
“Given our proximity to the people we serve, we are often dealing with the fallout of these decisions that are made at the federal level,” said Mayor Jared Nicholson of Lynn, who added that communication barriers are a major concern throughout the city, where over 40 languages are spoken and nearly 36 percent of residents are foreign born. 
For now, the city is relying on the Lynn Community Health Center, which operates school-based services that remain their main touchpoint with children enrolled in Medicaid.  
City officials in Malden have similar fears. Around 70 languages are spoken in its public schools, and more than 41 percent of the population is foreign born. Educating residents will be their biggest challenge. 
The federal tax bill will cut an estimated $1.75 billion from the Massachusetts health care system, according to Gov. Maura Healey’s administration. Municipalities are reimbursed for Medicaid expenses, particularly through the School-Based Medicaid Program and other qualifying services.  
In Fitchburg, Mayor Sam Squailia says this funds a portion of their budget, and the city may have to cut services or raise taxes to offset the loss of those reimbursements. 
“We’re just hoping not to instill fear and panic in the community,” Pinjic said. “We are yet to learn what the state of Massachusetts is actually going to do.”

(Photo by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement via Getty Images)Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.
Trump’s deportations could cost 6M jobs, report finds

The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.










The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling. 


– Oregon Republican state Rep. Cyrus Javad


Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.
If Trump wants more deportations, he’ll need to target the construction industry

Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.
More cities, counties join immigrant sanctuary lawsuit seeking to block Trump funding cuts

Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

Omar Fateh, DFL-Minneapolis, speaks to Uber and Lyft drivers outside the Capitol in 2023. (Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer)A few days ago, after state Sen. Omar Fateh won an ultra-rare Minneapolis DFL mayoral endorsement, Reformer editor J. Patrick Coolican wondered in his newsletter why it mattered. Let’s just say I — a former journalist, current DFL activist, and guy who will rank Fateh in November — clapped back on social media; what followed was, in political parlance, a frank exchange of views.
Coolican’s not-unreasonable case was that the city DFL can’t really throw money at its endorsee (true) and there’s a rich statewide example of Democratic voters rejecting the party’s gubernatorial endorsees. (Think Gov. Tim Walz primary victory over convention winner state Sen. Erin Murphy in 2018.)
I don’t have a crystal ball, so I can’t say Coolican is wrong. But there are several reasons why doubters might be.
First, while statewide Dems regularly topple their delegates’ choice, Minneapolis doesn’t have nearly that track record. Before Saturday, we endorsed once this century: R.T. Rybak in 2009, when he had only token opposition. The last non-incumbent endorsement was Don Fraser in 1979, for an open seat that he wound up winning. According to Rybak and others, an incumbent mayor has never been passed over for a rival since the 1944 merger created the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. 
More recently, conventions have foretold incumbent fortunes. In 2001, Rybak denied incumbent Sharon Sayles Belton endorsement; he won resoundingly in November. In 2017, incumbent Betsy Hodges failed to claim the crown, hammered from left and right after protesters shut down the Minneapolis Police 4th Precinct, and lost to Frey. Frey has never won mayoral endorsement, having blocked a party endorsement in 2021. He overcame 2021’s rejection as an incumbent, but his opposition was much less known, funded, and coordinated than this year.
That’s all history; one objective way to view the endorsement’s worth is how hard candidates work for it. This was Fateh’s Super Bowl; his experienced grassroots team helped drive caucus turnout to new heights this spring, which rivals like Rev. Dr. Dewayne Davis lauded afterwards. But Frey, too, played. Not one but two (tacitly) affiliated PACs messaged relentlessly in advance of caucuses, and the mayor himself was personally calling delegates before the convention.
For Frey, this was a defensive move; even allies told media pre-convention that he was likely to finish second, so the goal was to block endorsement, like usual. But in a city that uses ranked choice voting, Fateh, Davis and fellow challenger Jazz Hampton have been campaigning together; in hindsight, their delegates executed a mini-RCV, when the trio’s delegates coalesced to get Fateh over the 60% threshold.
Frey has traditionally enjoyed a huge fundraising advantage, and especially after 2021’s 12-point victory over unheralded opposition, has cultivated an air of inevitability. Davis and Hampton — or enough of their convention supporters — deemed puncturing that inevitability worth elevating Fateh. 
For the first time since 2017, it’s easier for those unsold on Frey’s leadership to imagine a city not led by him. Fateh, Davis and Hampton will never catch Team Frey’s fundraising, especially now that Frey can milk the heightened threat of a democratic socialist DFLer winning. But the endorsement  fuels organizing energy, and rivals’ donors may give more if they are worried less about dollars being thrown down a rathole.
While the city DFL won’t help much financially, the party has clout. In its appeal to the state party over convention voting procedures, Team Frey clearly seeks valuable voter info denied to non-endorsees. Assuming the controversy resolves in Fateh’s favor, his face will grace the top of the DFL sample ballot sent to tens of thousands of voters. DFL subgroups that Team Frey worked hard to capture must now retract any endorsement recommendation that isn’t Fateh, and labels like “DFL Feminist Caucus” can’t grace the mayor’s upcoming direct mail avalanche. It’s branding, of uncertain value, but likely some.
And in a heavily DFL city, the endorsement buttresses a burgeoning attack that Frey relies on Republicans. On X, GOP consultant Dustin Grage thundered after the convention that “every Republican in Minneapolis is going to be voting for Jacob Frey.” Many already donate; for example, Star Tribune Republican columnist Andy Brehm gave $750 to Frey in 2023-24, a fact not disclosed in Brehm’s post-convention column eviscerating Fateh. (On that note: I’ve given to Davis, former challenger Emily Koski, and a PAC opposing Frey and his allies, and am fundraising for Fateh, Davis and Hampton.)
Does this signal an inevitable Frey loss? Of course not. Frey and his “uniparty” allies will have the most money to pound a final message; 2021’s playbook of cops and capital threatening to leave has yet to be overcome; and partisan conventions never fully capture an electorate broader than the DFL. 
But journalists — at least those who look deeper than Star Tribune opinion writers upset about convention menus — may notice the anti-Frey coalition is bigger than democratic socialists and more willing to work together, which ought to motivate them to seek explanations beyond the labels.
The endorsement process has been attacked for empowering only people who can slog 12 hours on a Saturday; Frey and his allies will try to delegitimize it further. But after this spring’s high caucus attendance and this week’s crackling energy, the endorsement process has catalyzed real choices in November, which, after all, is supposed to be the point of democracy.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/P1139196-1024x711.jpg,,,2025-07-24 08:56:09.349011

It's not likely to get any help from the state, which is struggling with its own deficit.","In summary
Cal State’s budget gap is now $2.3 billion. It’s not likely to get any help from the state, which is struggling with its own deficit. 


California State University says it’s short $2.3 billion, a staggering budget gap that’s grown sharply since the system first revealed two years ago that it didn’t have the money to properly educate its students.How the nation’s largest public four-year university system will generate that revenue is anyone’s guess, as annual tuition increases of 6% that kicked in last year and an influx of state taxpayer support have been insufficient to pay for Cal State’s growing labor, energy and education expenses.The details of that cumulative gap were unveiled at the bimonthly Cal State Board of Trustees meeting this week. More state support is increasingly unlikely, as California budget experts forecast multi-billion-dollar budget shortfalls worsened by severe federal cuts to major public safety-net programs, like Medicaid, and possible federal cuts to public research and financial aid.
The funding shortfall, which doesn’t include billions of dollars in building maintenance backlogs, is a large portion of the system’s roughly $9 billion operating budget.“This growing gap demonstrates why we need immediate action to achieve financial sustainability,” said Jeni Kitchell, an assistant vice chancellor for finance of Cal State. “We cannot sustain our current level of funding, especially while operating from a position of underfunding.”The system fought off a $375 million proposed cut to its state allocation this year, instead receiving a $144 million cut — a 3% reduction in its state support. Lawmakers are offering Cal State a zero-interest loan to make up for that cut and promised to restore the money next year.
Already Cal State has cut more than 1,200 staff positions across the system in the past two years, reduced student support staff by 7% and terminated 1,400 courses during a period of ongoing budget deficits. 
Without an infusion of cash, the system will have to shift money from some of its initiatives — including improving graduation rates — just to cover mandatory costs, such as health care, insurance, utilities, financial aid and agreed-upon union raises, Cal State leaders said. In such a scenario, system documents show, campuses may have to continue the cost-cutting they’ve implemented, which has included layoffs, reducing job categories, cutting courses and leaving job vacancies unfilled. 
This year’s budget gap is $164 million.
State promises of more funding ‘violated’ 
Some Cal State trustees said they are frustrated that Gov. Gavin Newsom delayed his promises of five years of increasing state support, which was supposed to total more than $1 billion. Only three years of that compact have been funded to date; the fourth, which was supposed to kick in this year, will instead be spread out between 2026 and 2028, lawmakers and Newsom decided in the most recent state budget deal. Lawmakers didn’t signal a fifth year of compact funding, though they may in next year’s budget deal. 
“We were promised a five-year compact,” said Jack McGrory, a Cal State trustee. He argued that Cal State trustees approved 10% or more in salary increases for workers the past two years based on those promises. “We did rely on the promise, and the promise was violated, and that’s the story that we have to tell, and it’s unfortunate, and it’s going to put our relationships with the unions and our employees in a really bad situation,” McGrory added.If the compact money or the $144 million state spending cut aren’t restored, Cal State won’t be able to grow student enrollment at a time when more high school graduates are completing the courses needed to be eligible for Cal State admissions. The system currently enrolls 460,000 students.
“How do we enroll more students if we do not have the resources to hire more faculty, to provide more staff support,” add mental health counselors and more free-food programs for Cal State’s largely low-income students, asked Patrick Lenz, the interim chief financial officer of Cal State.
Cal State has been trying to slow its spending. The chancellor’s office is cutting its budget by $18 million, or 8%, trustees learned at this week’s meeting. Several campuses in the Bay Area are consolidating their administrative offices to lower expenses. And last fall the system approved the merging of two campuses to avoid millions of dollars in new spending. 
Unions say they’re owed raises
Meanwhile, thousands of employees are in a dispute with Cal State leadership over whether their union contracts guarantee them raises this year. The contracts say that if lawmakers fully fund the Cal State system, some of its workers get raises. 
Cal State’s leadership says that because state lawmakers cut the system’s funding by $144 million, they can’t give raises. Unions say because the state is allowing Cal State to borrow that money as a zero-interest loan, the system is fully funded. Cal State says borrowing money isn’t the same as being fully funded by the state. System leaders also lack confidence that the state will repay the system for that 3% cut next year. If the money doesn’t appear next year, Cal State is stuck with a loan that adds to their budget crisis. 
At least two state lawmakers are siding with unions. “Damn it, we are here to send a clear message. Do you hear us? Because guess what, if they don’t get what they deserve, we’re going to shut the s— down,” said Assemblymember Mike Gipson, a Democrat from Gardena, at a press conference outside the system’s headquarters Tuesday morning. He was addressing Cal State’s chancellor and other leaders who were assembled yards away for their meeting.“With everything going on with ICE, we don’t need to add additional pressure on not only the students but the faculty here. They’re already traumatized. Our state is already traumatized,” Gipson added.Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi, a Democrat from Torrance, said he stands in “solidarity” with union workers to “to call on the chancellor and the trustees to keep your promise.”The California State University Employees Union, with 35,000 clerical, custodial and student assistant members, says that the raises they think they’re owed are worth $30 million more than what Cal State plans to give them.Erin Foote, a vice president for organizing for the union, said in an interview that Cal State leaders should partner with the union in pushing for legislation or a ballot measure to ensure Cal State and University of California have guaranteed funding. “It costs millions of dollars to run a revenue measure, and we would need the CSU to be our partner,” Foote said.
Cal State’s cash reserves are at $760 million — enough to operate the system for a month.
How Cal State’s budget shortfall grew
How did Cal State’s cumulative funding gap grow from $1.5 billion to $2.3 billion since 2023? Chancellor’s office staff point to these latest budget realities:

$143.8 million: the amount of Cal State’s cut in state support this year
$310.5 million: the growth in labor costs
$322 million: the budget shortfalls at Cal State’s campuses the past three years

In that same time, Cal State’s revenue grew, but not by enough to cover the increase in costs. State funding that goes to the system’s operating budget — the corpus of money to pay for its education mission — grew from $4.5 billion to $4.87 billion last year. State support is Cal State’s largest source of funding for its operations. And the system’s tuition revenue jumped from $3.24 billion to $3.53 billion. Combined, those are increases of almost $700 million, according to the system’s financial transparency portal. 
Next year is projected to be more of the same fiscal hurt.Cal State budget officials say that the system will incur $365 million in new, mandatory costs in 2026-27, including $63 million in increased staff health care premiums and about $160 million in wage increases. That amount doesn’t include growing enrollment by the 3,500 students that the compact requires, which would cost $56 million.
For Cal State to afford the new, mandatory expenses, the state would need to return the 3% cut and a portion of the compact funding the system was supposed to get this year. None of that is a sure bet. 
The funding they can rely on is new tuition revenue: students will be charged another 6% increase next fall.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/050625_CSU-San-Marcos_AH_CM_18.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-24 08:56:09.349011

Even more tragic is that pregnant patients in both rural and urban areas will have a much harder time having a safe birth.","Guest Commentary written by

John McHugh
John McHugh is an obstetrician who has practiced for decades in Southern California. He is chair of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology for District IX, which includes California.


A few months ago, I worked my final night as an OB/GYN on labor and delivery at USC Verdugo Hills Hospital in the Los Angeles County city of Glendale. I wanted my team of doctors, nurses and other staff to get together one last time and connect before we shut down the unit.  
There were no patients in the labor rooms, no newborns in the nursery, and the halls were silent. So different from the nights when we pulled together to help so many, and were proud every time we assisted a new mother going home with her baby. The ambulances had already been told to take pregnant patients elsewhere. Patients had been rescheduled at other hospitals. 
In the quiet of the postpartum unit, some staff shared that they had been born here; others told stories of celebrating the births of friends and family members. Many talked about how meaningful it was to be able to show their children the cribs they had been warmed in after birth. It reminded me how, when I was a child, each time we drove past the hospital where I was born, I waved, believing the bricks remembered me, too. 
Today, as hospitals and even more labor and delivery units close in California and across the country, many will not have those memories. Even more tragic is that pregnant patients in many areas of the state will have a much harder time having a safe birth.
Nearly 60 hospitals and labor and delivery units across California have closed since 2012; roughly 30% of those were in Los Angeles County. Typically, when we think about maternity care access issues, we think of rural areas, where geography compounds long-standing problems. Over half of rural counties across the U.S. are without access to obstetric care. But according to recent research, one-third of urban U.S. hospitals did not offer obstetric services in 2022.
California labor and delivery units are closing for several reasons. Across the country, reimbursement for obstetric services is not keeping pace with inflation, forcing hospital administrators to decide if they can provide services that cost more than the payment they receive. U.S. birth rates also are declining. And the high cost of housing, especially in places like California, is pushing people to start families farther away from cities. 
California labor and delivery units are closing at a rate three times faster than in other parts of the country. 
Fewer hospitals means longer wait times for pregnant patients — including at the emergency room, where they will be increasingly forced to go instead of labor and delivery units. Many emergency medical service providers, without specially trained staff, are ill-equipped to stabilize and treat pregnant patients. 
During the winter months, when many patients present with COVID and flu symptoms, emergency room waits can sometimes last for hours. A pregnant woman might have complaints — a stomach ache or some discharge — that seem minor enough to put other patients ahead of her. But these may in fact indicate a condition like preterm labor or ruptured membranes that requires urgent action. 
Legislators at the state and federal levels are working to address these problems. Last year, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (where I serve as chair) endorsed and the California Legislature passed AB 2490, the Reproductive Health Emergency Preparedness Program Act, to provide reproductive healthcare funding, training, and technical assistance for hospital emergency departments. But the governor vetoed the bill due to budgetary issues. 
In February, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators introduced the Rural Obstetrics Readiness Act. The legislation would provide, among other things, funding and resources to create obstetric emergency training programs for rural health care facilities that do not have dedicated labor and delivery units. Last fall, senators put forward the Keeping Obstetrics Local Act, to help rural and high-need urban hospitals deal with the high cost of operating a labor and delivery unit.
Meanwhile, labor and delivery units continue closing. 
In the part of L.A. County USC Verdugo Hills Hospital has served, other hospitals provide maternity services. So our patients will not feel the worst effects of the loss of a labor and delivery unit. But the nurses have moved on, and many of the doctors have opened new offices elsewhere.
There remains a hole in this community, and memories lost. Unless we prioritize keeping labor and delivery units open, Californians will continue to sacrifice pieces of their past — and the ability to safely give birth close to home for years and years to come.

After the Taliban retook control in 2021, tens of thousands of Afghans resettled in California. Many of them worked for the U.S. government in Afghanistan. But in his second term, President Donald Trump has withdrawn legal protections and erected new barriers to permanent status that threaten their future in their adopted home.


Marwa made it out of Afghanistan with only one of her children.
As Taliban forces retook control of the country in August 2021, Marwa and other Afghans working for the United States government headed to the Kabul airport to help facilitate a chaotic withdrawal. Following instructions from her supervisor at the U.S. Embassy, who told Marwa that her family would be sent for later, she brought nothing but her infant son who was still breastfeeding.
For four days, between shifts cleaning, managing lists of evacuees, escorting people and translating, Marwa said she tried in vain to get her elder son and daughter inside. Even after they pushed through surging crowds and ducked gunfire from Taliban militants to reach the airport gates, her kids were not allowed past a strict military checkpoint. With her phone battery dead, Marwa could not reach her supervisor before she evacuated.
Now resettled in California, Marwa has been fighting through dead ends and black boxes of information from the U.S. government for nearly four years to reunite with her children, who later escaped with family members to Pakistan. She came painfully close earlier this year when they were scheduled on a Jan. 20 flight to Sacramento – then President Donald Trump, on his first day back in office, signed an executive order that canceled Afghan family reunification flights.
“I’m exhausted. There was times that I wanted to suicide. There was times that I give up,” Marwa said. CalMatters is referring to her only by a family nickname, because of ongoing safety threats that her family faces in Afghanistan.
“That’s the horrible part, that you don’t have any other choice but to exist, but to live, but to be present, but to be there,” she said. “My soul is dying. It’s only my body that sometimes is just pushing. And it’s just because of my kids.”
The devastating blow has been compounded in the months since by a stream of federal policy changes that not only closed the door to her children but may also force Marwa and other Afghan asylees like her out of the country.
California is home to the most Afghans in U.S.
Nearly 200,000 Afghans arrived in the United States under former President Joe Biden, according to the U.S. State Department, first in a massive airlift as the American military pulled out of Afghanistan and then through programs to relocate people left behind who had worked with the U.S. government, their families and others particularly vulnerable to retribution from the Taliban.
More ended up in California – which became a popular landing spot for refugees after the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan – than anywhere else in the country. The state was home to more than 58,000 Afghan immigrants in 2023, according to the most recently available U.S. Census Bureau data compiled by the Migration Policy Institute. Sacramento and Alameda counties have the largest Afghan immigrant populations in the United States, with thousands more in Contra Costa, Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange and Stanislaus counties.

But in the past six months, the Trump administration has blocked pathways for hundreds of thousands of Afghans still seeking to come to the United States. It has also canceled legal protections for many who are already here and erected new barriers to permanent status that cast doubt on their future in their adopted home. There is little California has been able to do to fill the gap as the federal government pulls back its support.
California’s Afghan community is reeling, with many recent arrivals who assisted the U.S. in its two-decade war and operation to rebuild Afghanistan feeling betrayed, said David Malikyar, a resettlement manager for the Los Angeles-based nonprofit the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights.
“Fear rules the day,” said Malikyar, an Afghan refugee of the 1980s Soviet war who now helps immigrants navigate the asylum process, apply for public benefits and deal with the culture shock of a new country. “They are becoming disheartened and they are losing momentum in their belief in America and its democracy as they knew it.”
Trump closes doors to Afghans
The situation is complicated by the haphazard conditions under which many Afghans arrived in the United States. The military rapidly evacuated more than 120,000 people from Kabul in 2021, and tens of thousands without official permission to immigrate here were granted humanitarian parole while they applied for asylum or visas. Others fled the Taliban regime and presented themselves at the southern border after the Biden administration created a temporary protected status for Afghans in 2022.
Those who came through the refugee program or on special immigrant visas — for military interpreters and people who worked for the U.S. government – are on more solid footing, but may still be trying to bring over family members stuck abroad. One such visa holder was detained at a federal immigration office in Connecticut last week during a routine green card application appointment, raising new questions about how aggressively the Trump administration may pursue deportations of Afghans.
Malikyar said the distress in the Afghan community is further exacerbated by misinformation circulating on social media about the effects of Trump’s executive orders and by their provisional work authorization, which has made it difficult for many to find jobs.
Advocates for Afghan immigrants, including groups of veterans who served alongside them during the war, have made a loud public case to the federal government not to abandon U.S. allies. Yet it has not slowed the Trump administration’s crackdown.
The president signed executive orders on Jan. 20 pausing all refugee admissions, including for already approved cases. The order also canceled foreign aid, which funded resettlement agencies in the United States. Then in April, the Department of Homeland Security announced that it would not renew the temporary protected status that shields Afghans from deportation, which ended on July 14.
The following month, the State Department notified Congress it was shutting down the office that coordinates continuing relocation efforts for Afghans. A few days later, in June, Trump placed Afghanistan on a list of countries whose citizens are banned from entering the United States. Provisions in his priority bill that just passed Congress create expensive new fees for asylum, humanitarian parole and temporary protected status, while making applicants ineligible for social services such as health care and food benefits.
“All of these different dynamics come together and basically choke any of the hope that people had,” Malikyar said.
A.T. has been waiting for three years for a determination on his asylum claim. He fears being sent back to Afghanistan if his humanitarian parole, which expires in August, is not reauthorized. CalMatters is referring to him by his initials for his safety.
A high-ranking civil servant in Afghanistan, A.T. and his family joined the throngs fleeing the Taliban in 2021 because his position in the government and his working relationship with international communities put them in danger. After sneaking out of the country with help from connections at the U.S. Embassy, A.T. said he learned that Taliban officials had searched his apartment and taken his car.
“It’s not easy to leave your country behind,” he said. “We were relieved that at least we could make it.”

A.T.’s family eventually moved to the Los Angeles area, where his sister had lived for four decades. In 2022, they applied for asylum after determining it would be their only legal route to stay in the United States, and they were interviewed twice that summer. While his son was approved and received a green card last year, A.T. and his wife have yet to hear anything about their case, he said. The stress has caused them to seek mental health counseling.
Though still grateful to the United States and others who had “shed their blood and their taxpayer money with Afghans to get rid of terrorism in that country,” A.T. said he now feels disappointed and worried that the American government will not follow through on what it owes its allies.
“The Afghans paid a very high price. People lost their loved ones. They lost parts of their bodies,” he said. “Please do not forget Afghans who fought with you in the war against terror. Whenever you give some final decision about the status, please consider the facts.”
California is not stepping in
While advocates hoped California might backfill aid for its Afghan immigrants, resources are limited.
The California Department of Social Services runs a program to help Afghans arriving as refugees or with special immigrant visas integrate into their community, but it is supported by federal funding. The department would not make anyone available to discuss the program and how its work has changed under the Trump administration; spokesperson Theresa Mier repeatedly refused to explain why.
With state officials working to close another multibillion-dollar deficit this year, even small funding requests have been rejected. Immigrant rights groups sponsored bills to establish a state immigrant and refugee affairs agency and to expand resettlement services to more recent arrivals, neither of which made it out of legislative fiscal committees.
The state budget includes $10 million for immigration legal services statewide, which could support Afghans navigating the asylum process, but it’s a small fraction of what organizations requested as the Trump administration ramps up its mass deportation agenda.
Opening Doors, a nonprofit that has served immigrants and refugees in Sacramento for about three decades, was actively working with 521 Afghans in the early stages of resettlement and 83 more who had already booked travel when Trump signed the executive order suspending the refugee program.
Chief Executive Officer Jessie Mabry said she immediately laid off 15% of her staff to maintain enough resources to pay for housing and other critical needs for refugee clients, who are supposed to receive assistance for 90 days to get on their feet.
“We made a commitment that we were not leaving those folks high and dry, that it would be immoral,” she said.
A two-year grant from the Department of Social Services – which state officials pushed through at the beginning of the year as it became clear that the Trump administration would end federal funding – stabilized Opening Doors.
Mabry said it has been essential because hundreds of Afghans continue to arrive in the Sacramento region. They are traveling on special immigrant visas that were approved before the federal government paused its resettlement work and are paying their own way to the United States, often with help from family or community groups.
In the past few months, Mabry said, Opening Doors has submitted more than 300 emergency applications for federal resettlement assistance for recent Afghan arrivals, as a lawsuit over the program shutdown plays out; 93 of those new enrollments were approved as of June 1.
“I’m worried about people slipping through the gaps,” she said. “There is just a sense of uncertainty and anxiety that cannot be overstated.”
Families still separated by politics
When the Taliban reentered Kabul in August 2021, Marwa was working with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, a job that she hoped would eventually allow her to apply for a special immigrant visa to move to the U.S. Now it made her vulnerable to reprisal from Taliban forces, for being an enemy collaborator.
Marwa was going through a divorce and had moved into her parents’ home with her three children – a 10-year-old daughter, a five-year-old son and a four-month-old baby. That day, Marwa said, dozens of Taliban soldiers and the father of her estranged husband showed up demanding her infant son, whom her in-laws saw as their financial future. While her father distracted them, Marwa said she fled by climbing over a wall to a neighbor’s home.
Marwa knew she needed to leave the country. She reported for duty at the military airport in Kabul, where she realized that many of her colleagues had ignored the order not to bring their families along because this was their opportunity to escape.

Before she could get her two elder children into the airport, Marwa said her baby fell ill. When she sought treatment for his diarrhea and vomiting, she said she was instead pushed onto a departing plane. 
“I didn’t move. I didn’t say anything. I was only crying and my heart was full of anger, full of emotions, full of pain,” she said. “The only thing that I will be regretting for [my] entire life would be listening” to instructions not to bring her family with her to the airport.
Marwa eventually settled in the Sacramento region, where she knew a former colleague from the embassy in Kabul. But her efforts to bring the rest of her family to the United States have dragged on unsuccessfully for years and without clear explanation, even as she has sought help from members of Congress and UN officials.
Her children, her mother and five siblings evacuated to Pakistan in 2022, expecting they would all soon be able to immigrate, before their visas eventually expired, Marwa said. Her father, who surrendered his passport to the Taliban as they tried to pressure Marwa to return to Afghanistan, was killed while on a video call with her as he walked to the bakery to buy bread.
Her own situation is unstable. Marwa was granted asylum, but she doesn’t know if she will be able to stay in the country, where her youngest son has received medical treatment for a tumor.
She does know she cannot return to Afghanistan. She is certain she would be killed or thrown in prison for having worked with the U.S. government. Marwa is angry with the Trump administration for shutting out Afghans now, because during his first term, Trump kicked off the negotiations with the Taliban that led to the United States’ 2021 withdrawal and her forced immigration.
“You’re the reason why I’m experiencing this,” she said. “It has been more than four years, and I’m still in shock. My mind is not accepting that the Taliban is back.”
Yet her primary focus is reuniting with her children, whom she compared to “tiny toys” destroyed by the immigration system. While Marwa tries to speak with her children every day, unstable electricity and internet access sometimes makes it impossible. When she reads about an explosion or kidnapping and can’t reach them, it puts her in a panic not knowing whether they are safe.
She said that the lack of information she has been able to provide them about when they might join her in the United States has put a strain on their relationship and made her feel like a “criminal hostage.” It’s been particularly excruciating watching from afar as her daughter has grown up from a skinny and shy little girl into a teenager; it pained Marwa not to be with her daughter to guide her through her first period.
“I’m coming from work, opening the apartment, holding my baby, and there is silence everywhere,” she said. “There’s no hugs, there’s no kisses.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/071725-Afghan-Refugee-RA-CM-06.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-24 08:56:09.349011

Bailey filed the lawsuit against the Planned Parenthood Federation of America on Wednesday in Cole County Circuit Court.
The lawsuit argues Planned Parenthood’s national organization has misled consumers about the safety of mifepristone, which is used in a regimen with another drug to expel a pregnancy.
The lawsuit seeks more than $1.8 million in civil penalties, up to $1,000 in damages or restitution for every Missouri woman Planned Parenthood provided abortion pills to in the past five years, reimbursement to the state for Medicaid and other taxpayer-funded emergency care resulting from abortion pill complications, and a court order for Planned Parenthood to stop certain advertisements for mifepristone.
Mifepristone is a drug used for medication abortions. Planned Parenthood says the drug is safe and effective, but Bailey points to a small percentage of patients who need emergency care after having a medication abortion.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration information and label for the medication says it can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections or bleeding, but that label also says U.S. clinical studies found serious adverse effects in less than 0.5% of patients.
Bailey’s lawsuit points to that label, along with other studies that say 4.6% of women who undergo a medication abortion may need emergency care after the procedure.
The lawsuit takes aim at Planned Parenthood’s comparison between mifepristone and other common medications like Tylenol, penicillin and Viagra. An archived page from Planned Parenthood’s website, which is linked in the lawsuit, said medication abortions are safer than those over-the-counter drugs.
The lawsuit says that claim is misleading, if not false, for reasons including the abortion pill and the other drugs having different uses.

While Bailey’s lawsuit doesn’t directly target Missouri’s Planned Parenthood affiliates, the lawsuit says Planned Parenthood’s advertisements for the abortion pill directs consumers to Missouri’s Planned Parenthood locations.
Medication abortions are not currently available at Missouri Planned Parenthood locations. Planned Parenthood Great Plains President and CEO Emily Wales said in a March statement that the abortion pill hasn’t been available in Missouri since 2018. Bailey’s lawsuit concerns medication abortions women from Missouri have undergone since 2020.
Since the lawsuit does not target abortions performed in Missouri, but abortions Missouri women have received, it applies to out-of-state medication abortions.
In the roughly two and a half years between the overturning of Roe v. Wade and abortions becoming available in Missouri again, Missouri residents had to go to other states like Kansas or Illinois, where abortion was legal, to obtain medication abortions.
“Planned Parenthood’s false advertising has a national reach,” Bailey said in a press release, “including targeted claims against Missouri women.”

Water levels in the reservoir have steadily dropped over the years as the Colorado River – the lake’s biggest source of water – has been choked by rising temperatures, prolonged drought and growing demand.
If reservoir storage continues on its current trajectory, Lake Mead’s water elevation is likely to drop to about 1,038 feet by the end of June 2027 – two feet lower than when it fell to a record low in July 2022, according to a two year forecast released by the federal agency last week. 
That projection is based on the most probable scenario, but federal water managers also considered what the lake could look like if the next two years are drier than usual. 
In the worst case scenario, Lake Mead’s water elevation could fall even further to about 1,026 feet – one foot short of the most severe water shortage level defined by BuRec which would trigger record cuts to water use in Arizona and Nevada.
Lake Mead is already under a Tier 1 shortage – the least severe level – which mandates a 21,000 acre-feet annual reduction in the state’s share of the Colorado River. That shortage level, and the reduction in Nevada’s water allocation, is likely to continue next year under current projections.
But steeper water cuts are likely to take place in 2027 under the most probable scenario, according to the study. 
Federal water managers projected Lake Mead’s elevation would likely drop to below 1,050 feet by July 2026, triggering a more severe Tier 2 shortage which would reduce annual available water for Nevada by another 4,000 acre-feet.
Federal water managers decide shortage levels each year in August, based on projected water levels at Lake Mead and Lake Powell for the start of the following year.
The troubling projections come as the seven states that share the Colorado River’s water are in deadlocked negotiations over how the river and its reservoirs should be managed after current guidelines expire at the end of 2026.
The states — Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming — primarily disagree over which of them should have to decrease their water use, and by how much.
‘Uncertainty is difficult to plan around’
Negotiations have continued behind closed doors for months as water officials try to reach an agreement. 
The federal government has given the states until mid-November to come up with a draft for a new plan. If they can’t reach a deal ahead of a 2026 deadline, the federal government can step in and make those decisions itself.
The lackluster reservoir forecast follows a winter of below-average snowpack across the Upper Colorado River Basin, a major source of snowmelt for Lake Mead and Lake Powell.
Climate scientists studying water supply on the Colorado River were not surprised by the latest projections, which reflect a two decade trend of decreasing streamflow into the river and its reservoirs. 
“I’ve been warning about this situation since last fall. The worst has come true,” said Utah State University professor Jack Schmidt. 
Without an effort to seriously recover water storage in Lake Mead and Lake Powell in order to withstand dry years, the river could be on the “brink of crisis,” said Schmidt.
Schmidt said reservoir storage across the Colorado River will only gain a fraction of the water collected in previous years due to below-average snowpack and warmer temperatures.
This year snowmelt inflow to Lake Powell is predicted to be about half of average, one of the lowest inflow years in the past two decades. Lake Powell’s water levels directly affect Lake Mead because streamflow to Lake Powell is eventually released to Lake Mead.
“We’ve got the onset of an extremely dry year, and we’re on the brink of collapsing the system,” Schmidt said.
Two consecutive winters with robust snowpacks in 2023 and 2024 gave states that rely on the Colorado River a few more years of stability, but with a dismal water year approaching Lake Mead and Lake Powell are on a path to record low elevations. 
“We’ve done a poor job since then and never significantly recovered storage,” Schmidt said. 
Schmidt emphasized the need for immediate water conservation efforts to reduce water use across all seven states that rely on the river to protect the river and its reservoirs from collapse. 
“The system we have is not good enough, and it’s not working, so this is a warning that we need to become far more flexible and far more adaptable,” he said. 
Despite drought challenges, Southern Nevada remains one of the most water-secure areas along the Colorado River. 
Southern Nevada hasn’t used its full allocation of Colorado River water for years. Conservation efforts have helped Southern Nevada use 36% less water from Lake Mead than it did two decades ago, according to the Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA).
The water authority also said it’s confident Southern Nevada can weather even the most severe water shortage, Tier 3, which would require Nevada to give up enough water to supply about 60,000 households for a year. 
Bronson Mack, the outreach manager for SNWA, said Lake Mead’s water levels over the next two years will depend significantly on winter snowpack and soil conditions in the Upper Colorado River Basin.
“The potential for historically low lake levels is what catalyzed our community’s adaptation toward using less water more efficiently,” Mack said. 
“Water conservation continues to be critical throughout the Colorado River Basin, and the Bureau of Reclamation’s most recent 24-month study further emphasizes that,” he continued.
Still, the lack of agreement between states on future guidelines has also created a lot of uncertainty for water users, said Kathryn Sorensen, the director of research at the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University.
“There’s a total unknown still about what happens after the current shortage sharing guidelines expire, and what will be the new operating guidelines. There’s a lot of uncertainty, and uncertainty is difficult to plan around,” Sorensen said. 
Sorensen said record low water elevations at Lake Mead and Lake Powell are “the new normal,” adding that water utilities should prepare for a future where the most severe water shortage level is more and more common while communicating risks to customers.
“This latest 24-month study report is not good news, but it is what many have been warning about. The river is just producing less on average,” Sorensen said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/81047811-1024x791.jpg,,,2025-07-24 08:56:09.349011

(Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)The Utah State Hospital has come a long way since it was conceived as the Utah Territorial Insane Asylum in 1885 at a Provo location meant to be as distant as possible from the city’s center. As this month marks its 140th anniversary, neighbors now use the 312-acre campus as an outdoor recreation spot, while inside, a much smaller patient population can cope and heal. 
The hospital treats children, teens and adults with severe mental illness, as well as adults who need mental health treatment before they can face charges in court, a big change from how it worked during its inception, when the facility was the first stop for mental health disorders. 
The campus has been in the community longer than Utah has been a state and has evolved with the times. Its staff now treats about 300 patients, only a portion of the 1,250 people the hospital housed in the 1950s. Care is more personalized and thoughtful, treatment units are smaller, and overcrowding isn’t as big of an issue.

Gov. Spencer Cox mentioned that fact at the Wednesday celebration, highlighting the team that makes the hospital run as “outstanding,” but also acknowledging a need for expansion.  
“When I share just those numbers, 1,250 patients who were here in the 1950s with only 1,000 beds, to recognize that we just have a fraction of those 1,000 beds,” Cox said. “Now we’re not a smaller state than we were when there were 700,000 people and 1,000 beds. There are, of course, now 3.5 million of us and many fewer beds, unfortunately.”
While the hospital reduced its patient intake capacity, it has also undergone substantial changes in its mission. It’s no longer the first stop for mental health patients, but the last resort. It’s also joined by many institutions across the state that provide similar care.

The state is grateful for that expansion, Cox said. But, he added, “there’s a desperate need for more of it.”
Obsolete practices have been replaced by better treatment, and care has become more compassionate, Cox said. But more investment and work is needed.
“I would just also say there is nothing compassionate about allowing patients who should be here, who are not here, who are killing themselves slowly on our streets. There’s nothing compassionate about that,” he said. “And too many have believed that that’s where we needed to be, that that’s where we need to go. And I think we’ve made a grave mistake.”
The state has also faced a lawsuit in recent years over extended wait times for people charged with crimes and ordered to receive competency restoration treatment at the Utah State Hospital, but who were instead spending months in jail waiting for a bed. In 2017 the state settled the case brought by the Disability Law Center and agreed to shorten wait times.

During the Wednesday event, Brandtley Henderson, the hospital’s music therapist sang happy birthday to the institution with an acoustic guitar as hundreds gathered on a big, green lawn near paths shaded by thick trees and a prime view of the Wasatch mountains. 
Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson commended the hospital for being “a place of not just housing,” but “a place of healing.” But it hasn’t always been that way, she said.
“People, maybe like me, could have been sent to a place like this for being too opinionated, right?” she said. “We know a lot more now about mental health and how to help and how to heal and how to provide hope, and that’s what this institution is.”
Henderson is right — 1885-1910 admission records from the hospital listed financial embarrassment, poverty, jealousy, worry, unreciprocated love, excessive reading, reading novels, girl trouble and other now unthinkable reasons as supposed causes of insanity. As late as 1963, a female patient’s cause was recorded as “frustrated housewife syndrome.”
Henderson said she expects doctors to learn even more about mental health care in the coming years, but for now, the state is “committed to maintaining this facility, to maintaining the function, the purpose, the why, and to making sure that more people have access and have the opportunity to not only experience healing here, but to experience the community that is here.”
Relocation talk
While the campus has remained a community landmark for over a century, during the last couple of years there have been talks about the potential sale of the prime Provo real estate. 
Rep. Tyler Clancy, R-Provo, proposed a bill in 2024 that, among many provisions, required the state to sell the property. However, that was scratched in an amendment and the Legislature only approved a study about issues relating to civil commitment, or a court-ordered intake of an individual with severe mental illness.
Despite that change in the bill, the idea hasn’t been extinguished. Earlier this year, Utah County commissioners voted in favor of a resolution to support a relocation proposal, according to KUTV. That may involve dispersing services throughout the state.

Senate Majority Assistant Whip, Mike McKell, R-Spanish Fork, opened a bill file titled “Utah State Hospital Amendments” during the 2025 legislative session, but ended up abandoning it.
About the relocation bills, a Department of Health and Human Services public information officer said in a prepared statement that in the department’s view, what matters most is that the state continues to ensure behavioral health care needs are met. 
“The Utah State Hospital has a long and proud tradition of serving Utahns with significant mental illness. We expect that tradition to continue, as there are continually growing needs for mental health treatment in our state,” the department said. “We are committed to continually improving the services we provide. We are also committed to working with our partners, including Utah legislators, the Utah Behavioral Health Commission, and local mental health authorities to maintain or improve the services we offer.”
However, with those potential relocation plans still uncertain, business continues as usual in the Provo campus. In a tour of the Lucybeth Rampton building — named after the former Utah first lady — Dr. Amanda Rapacz, assistant superintendent, and Dr. Paul Whitehead, medical director at the hospital, showcased the many ways patients are treated and what life in the hospital looks like.

Hallways filled with art and natural light from ceiling skylights lead to gyms for physical therapy, rooms for ceramics or music therapy, conference rooms for group sessions, a K-12 school run by the Provo School District, and even a cantine that accepts “hospital money” that patients can earn by participating in treatment or keeping their rooms clean.
Among the stars of the show are the courtyards, Rapacz and Whitehead said, where patients grow their own tomatoes to turn into salsa, and get to spend time outdoors, a rare feature among other state hospitals around the country that may be surrounded by city blocks and can’t allow patients outside, or have fences that give the space a “correctional” look.
“I’ve done individual therapy sessions out here, and the literature shows that green space and being outdoors is incredibly important for somebody’s recovery, and I think it’s one of the ways we’re really blessed,” Rapacz said.

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Advocates, experts, formerly incarcerated individuals and family members of those behind bars Wednesday described an Alabama prison system that kept inmates in a state of terror and a parole system that robbed inmates of hope.
Speaking to the Legislature’s Joint Prison Oversight Committee meeting in the Alabama Statehouse, witnesses described rampant drug use by those incarcerated in the state’s prisons; trafficking of illicit substances by corrections staff; constant extortion demands by people in prison against one another, and violence perpetrated by both staff and those in the custody of the Alabama Department of Corrections.
“There has got to be some change,” said Tim Mathis, whose son Chase was killed in Elmore Correctional Facility in June 2024.  “There are too many people dying. A lot of people here still have loved ones there. Mine is gone. There is nothing I can do for him, as much as I try and as much as I pray and cry over it. I am mad. I am not going to become unmad until something is done about this.”

Witnesses also said low parole rates have hurt morale among those in prison.
Speaking to the committee, Colleen Howell said former Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles Chair Leigh Gwathney accused her of lying about her son Corey’s efforts to rehabilitate himself after she spoke on his behalf at a parole hearing.
“She bombarded us and told us that our son was lying to us,” Colleen Howell said. “She said our son was lying to us and that he was not in the program. She was belittling us, chewing us out.”
Her son, she said, was granted parole after the board initially denied it.
A message was sent to the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles on Wednesday seeking comment.
Alabama’s prison system remains one of the most deadly in the nation. The ACLU of Alabama estimated that almost 280 people died while in the custody of the Alabama Department of Corrections in 2024. Alabama Appleseed, a criminal justice reform organization, estimated that there were 325 deaths in the state’s prisons in 2023.
The ACLU of Alabama reported that 46 of those deaths were due to overdoses and correctional staff was a factor that contributed to the deaths. The report states that another 77 people died from natural causes whose cause is unknown.
The deaths were concentrated in a handful of facilities, the ACLU report states. According to the report, 36 people at the Kilby Correctional Facility in 2024.  The report said 35 people died while incarcerated at the prison in St. Clair County, and that 34 people passed away at Limestone Correctional Facility in Limestone County.

‘Make sure at least our loved ones are safe’

Speakers during Wednesday’s public hearing spoke of the harrowing conditions within several of the state’s prisons.
Yolanda Williams, whose husband is incarcerated at Fountain Correctional Facility for a parole violation, said the overcrowding and state of the facility’s pipes are concerning.
“My husband is in a dorm in G.K. Fountain Correctional Facility that houses 80 men, but in that dorm, there’s a total of 150 men with seven to nine fans,” she told the committee.
Williams said her husband, a maintenance worker, works on pipes under the prison that are so corroded you can see human waste going through them. She said the waste goes through the plumbing system in the prison as well.
“The pipes were supposed to be, at one point, iron and now they’re visible where you can see feces every time someone flushes the toilet or urine every time someone uses the urinal,” she said. “Even just getting in the shower, turning the shower on, and feces are coming out through the overhead shower. That is deplorable.”
Williams said getting more health care workers in the prison and doing regular checks on the facilities should be a priority to help make prisons better.
“Get more health care workers in the prison because if there’s 100 men to one health care worker, the health care worker needs help,” she said. “Reach out to outside sources, fire marshals, have them go in to make sure that these buildings are cohabital. Make sure at least our loved ones are safe if there is an environmental issue.”
Colleen’s son Corey Howell, 29, was incarcerated in Alabama’s prison after his probation was revoked after he was sentenced for four years after he was convicted of illegal possession of marijuana and Xanax. Howell said he saw violence and drug use at Kilby and Ventress correctional facilities, where he was incarcerated. After being transferred to Staton Correctional Facility, Howell said he saw “my enemy” there.
“I went to tell the warden,” he said. “The warden tells me, ‘Go outside and die.’ He did not care whatsoever.”
A message was sent to the ADOC on Wednesday seeking comment.
Parole complaints
Complaints about the parole board surfaced throughout the proceedings. Gov. Kay Ivey earlier this month declined to reappoint Gwathney to the board, selecting Hal Nash, a former corrections deputy from Jackson County, to become chair of the board.
On multiple occasions, Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, requested feedback from several speakers regarding newly-published parole guidelines. One section dealt with re-entry and how the guidelines consider those who submit a housing and job plan.
“What it requires is for people who are incarcerated to find housing and find a job while they are in prison,” said Carla Crowder, executive director of Alabama Appleseed. “It is extremely difficult.”
She suggested subtracting points for those who find housing and a job, thereby increasing their chances for parole.
“That is something that could be easily remedied in these guidelines,” she said during the meeting.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_7343-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-24 08:56:09.349011

James asked that only his middle name be used to tell his story so that he wouldn’t lose health coverage or be accused of Medicaid fraud. He found his food service gig a few weeks into an addiction treatment program. The man in his late 30s said his boss “hasn’t been disappointed.”
“I’m a good worker,” he said with a grin.
James can get the prescription drugs that help him stabilize his life and hold down that job through Medicaid, the state-federal insurance program that covers people with low incomes or disabilities. Those drugs curb his desire for alcohol and treat long-standing conditions that exacerbate his addiction, including bipolar and insomnia disorders.
But he hasn’t qualified for the program in months, ever since his work hours increased and he received a raise of about $1 an hour. He exceeds his income eligibility limit of about $21,000 per year by roughly $50 a week.
James said that despite his raise, he’s struggling to cover routine expenses, such as keeping his car running and paying his phone bill. He said he can’t afford the care he needs even on the cheapest insurance plan available to him through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplace or through his job’s health insurance plan. Even paying $60 a month for his sleep medications — one of six prescriptions he takes daily — is too expensive.
“I only saw one option,” James said. “Fudge the numbers.”
James hasn’t reported his new income to the state. That puts him at odds with congressional Republicans who justified adding hurdles to Medicaid by claiming the system is rife with waste, fraud, and abuse. But James isn’t someone sitting on his couch playing video games, the type of person House Speaker Mike Johnson and other people said they would target as they sought work requirements.
Medicaid provides health coverage and long-term care to more than 70 million people in the United States. Those who study safety-net systems say it’s extremely rare for enrollees to commit fraud to tap into that coverage. In fact, research shows swaths of eligible people aren’t enrolled in Medicaid, likely because the system is so confusing. And nearly two-thirds of people on Medicaid in 2023 had jobs, according to an analysis by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Those transitioning off Medicaid may qualify for other subsidized or low-priced health plans through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplace. But, as in James’ case, such plans can have gaps in what care is covered, and more comprehensive private plans may be too expensive. So James and an unknown number of other people find themselves caught between working too much to qualify for Medicaid but earning too little to pay for their own health care.
James considers himself to be a patriot and said that people shouldn’t “use government funding to just be lazy.” He agrees with the Republican argument that, if able, people should work if they receive Medicaid. Hiding his hours on the job from the government bothers him, especially since he feels he must lie to access the medical care that enables him to work.
“I don’t want to be a fraud. I don’t want to die,” James said. “Those shouldn’t be the only two options.”
On July 4, Trump signed into law the major tax and spending bill that makes it harder for low-income workers to get Medicaid. That includes requiring beneficiaries to work or go to school and adding paperwork to prove every six months they meet a minimum number of hours on the job.
“It’s going to hurt people, whether they’re playing by the rules or not,” said Ben Sommers, a health economist at Harvard University. “We see this vilification of mostly very hard-working people who are really struggling and are benefiting from a program that helps them stay alive.”
James said he initially declined his raise because he worried about losing Medicaid. He had previously been kicked off the coverage about a month into his rehab program after finding work. To stay in the sober-living program he otherwise couldn’t afford, James said, he dropped just enough hours at work to requalify for Medicaid and then soon picked up hours again. If he didn’t earn more, he said, he had no chance of saving enough money to find housing after graduating from the treatment program.
“They’ll give you a bone if you stay in the mud,” James said. “But you have to stay there.”
That problem — becoming just successful enough to suddenly lose Medicaid — is common. It’s called a benefit cliff, said Pamela Herd, who researches government aid at the University of Michigan.
“It just doesn’t make any sense that someone gets a dollar pay raise and all of a sudden they lose all access to their health insurance,” Herd said.
She said a partial fix exists called continuous eligibility, which guarantees an individual’s Medicaid coverage for a specific period, such as a year or longer. The goal is to give people time to adjust when they do earn more money. Continuous eligibility also helps maintain coverage for low-income workers with unpredictable hours and whose pay changes month to month.
But Congress has moved in the other direction. Under the new law, policymakers limited windows of eligibility for able-bodied adults to every six months. That will put more people on the program’s eligibility cliff, Herd said, in which they must decide between losing access to coverage or dropping hours at work.
“It is going to be a nightmare,” Herd said.
Those federal changes will be especially difficult for people with chronic conditions, such as James in Montana.
Not that long ago, James wouldn’t have been breaking the rules to access Medicaid because his state had 12-month continuous eligibility. But in 2023, Montana began requiring enrollees to report any change in their income within 10 days.
James is proud of how far he’s come. About a year ago, his body was breaking down. He couldn’t hold a spoon to eat breakfast without whiskey — his hands shook too hard. He had alcohol-induced seizures. He said his memories from his unhealthiest times come in flashes: being put on a stretcher, the face of a worried landlord, ambulance lights in the background.
James recently graduated from his treatment program. He’s staying with a relative to save money as he and his girlfriend try to find an affordable place to rent — though even with Medicaid, finding housing feels like a stretch to him. He’s taking classes part-time to become a licensed addiction counselor. His dream is to help others survive addiction, and he also sees that career as a way out of poverty.
To James, all his progress rides on keeping Medicaid a bit longer.
“Every time I get a piece of mail, I am terrified that I’m gonna open it up and it’s gonna say I don’t have Medicaid anymore,” he said. “I’m constantly in fear that it’s gonna go away.”
As of mid-July, officials hadn’t noticed the extra $50 he makes each week.

To the right of Sen. Mitchell are her attorneys Matthew Keller, Dane DeKrey and Bruce Ringstrom Jr. (Photo by Anna Paige/Fargo Forum pool photo)Sen. Nicole Mitchell, DFL-Woodbury, will likely be required to spend at least four months in jail because of her first-degree felony conviction and the mandatory minimum sentence that comes with it, according to Minnesota statute.
The Woodbury Democrat was found guilty of felony burglary and possession of burglary tools last week after a five-day trial in Detroit Lakes. The prosecution successfully argued that Mitchell intended to steal her late father’s possessions from her stepmother when she broke into her Detroit Lakes home on April 22, 2024. The state’s main evidence was that she told police as much during her arrest, and the jury saw the footage of her admissions from police officers’ body-worn cameras.
Mitchell’s sentencing is scheduled for Sept. 10.
Minnesota’s first-degree burglary charge has a mandatory minimum sentence of six months in jail, but Seventh Judicial District Chief Judge Michael Fritz could order Mitchell to serve more jail time. The maximum sentence is 20 years for felony burglary, but Mitchell has no previous criminal record, and a lengthy sentence is highly unlikely. Because Minnesota requires convicted felons to serve two-thirds of their sentences incarcerated, Mitchell would spend four months of a mandatory six-month sentence in jail and the remaining one-third on probation.
People convicted of felonies typically go to jail in the county where the conviction occurred, but Mitchell will likely ask the court if she can be held in a jail closer to her Woodbury home so she’s closer to her two sons, said Dane DeKrey, one of the attorneys who defended Mitchell during her trial.
Fritz may make Mitchell eligible for work release, meaning she could serve her mandatory four-month sentence by working outside the jail during the day and sleeping there at night.
She won’t be doing her work release in the Senate, however: Mitchell announced she’s resigning Aug. 4, at the latest.
Despite the mandatory minimum sentence, DeKrey said there are exceptions in rare cases; Mitchell’s attorneys will argue that the senator doesn’t need to serve any time in custody.
“We think that a felony conviction, loss of your military career and loss of your Minnesota Senate seat is punishment enough for this crime,” DeKrey said.
Judges in Minnesota use the sentencing guidelines for people convicted of felonies to ensure sentences are uniform regardless of the person or their background. The severity of the sentence depends on the crime and the person’s criminal history, and judges consult a grid to determine the amount of months they should impose.
Mitchell has no criminal history — meaning her criminal history score is a “zero” — and first-degree burglary of an occupied dwelling comes with a presumptive sentence of 21 months, which is stayed. This means that the person won’t receive a prison sentence, but they will be placed on probation for that time.
Mitchell was also found guilty of possession of burglary tools — she had a small prybar that she used to pop open the basement window of her stepmother’s home and enter without permission — but Bradford Colbert, a professor at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law, said that charge likely won’t affect the sentence.
During the trial, Mitchell unsuccessfully tried to convince the jury of nine men and three women that she was in the Detroit Lakes home to conduct a welfare check on her stepmother. Mitchell testified in her own defense, and told the jury that her stepmother was struggling with paranoia due to Alzheimer’s disease.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/071925.N.FF_.MITCHELL10-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-24 08:56:09.349011

However, there is (for Christians, at least) a hopeful caveat in the Pew report: The increasing flight from Christianity in the U.S. did appear to slow slightly in the last couple of years. Yet whereas Pew reports showed 78% of Americans in 2007 formally identified as Christian, only 63% did so last year, a sharp and ecclesiastically alarming 15-point plunge in 17 years, according to the Center’s latest data.
This unprecedented national de-Christianization trend over decades, starting in the last millennium, has proceeded in tandem with a broader rejection of religion in general in America and throughout the industrialized West, although America was relatively late in catching the secular wave (and later yet, South Dakota).

 
Today, about 29% of Americans, nearly a third, identify as so-called “nones,” people who describe their religion, if any, as “nothing in particular.” These religiously apathetic citizens include atheists and agnostics. By comparison, 18 years ago, in 2007, “nones” comprised only 16% of Americans.
In South Dakota, the trend away from organized religion and faith is similar to but later than the national slide, yet still stark and worrisome to clergy and the faithful. The Aberdeen American News reported on polling in a 2022 article showing that the number of religiously unaffiliated South Dakotans nearly tripled from 8% in 2001 to 21% in 2021, along with declines in belief in “the Bible, God, angels, heaven and hell.”
The News reported: “Perhaps most worrisome for church leaders in America and South Dakota is that in recent surveys, the people who do not affiliate with any religion, the so-called ‘nones,’ are the fastest-growing segment of the national population as indicated in surveys about religion, faith and beliefs.”
Pew reported in its survey that South Dakotans, at 79%, exceeded the national proportion of citizens identifying as Christian in 2023-24, and that it had fewer self-identifying “nones” — 18% — than the 29% nationwide. But that still represented a significant minority of religiously unaffiliated citizens. Of the state’s “nones,” 13% described their religion as “nothing in particular,” 5% claimed agnosticism, and 1% were atheist.
Due to their dramatic growth nationwide, “nones” are now “the largest cohort in the U.S.” in the religious sphere, NPR reported. Currently, they are more numerous than American Catholics, who make up 23% of the overall population, and Protestants, 24%, according to a 2024 NPR report citing the latest Pew data.
A number of potential reasons have been cited for the drop-off in Americans’ affiliation with organized religion, including decades of steadily increasing secularization in the West and, following the COVID-19 pandemic, a growing animosity among Christian denominations, as well as the fact that belief in God among young Americans is “lower than ever,” the News noted. For example, 46% of the young identify as Christians versus 80% of their elders, according to Pew.
Gregory Smith, the lead researcher in the Pew study, contends that surging legions of “nones” could have an oversized effect on the nation’s public life going forward and “could change electoral politics in the coming decades.”
Although “nones” are currently less socially and civically engaged — and less likely to vote — than religious believers affiliated with churches and other faith organizations, they are also “the most strongly and consistently liberal and Democratic constituencies in the United States,” Smith said. Their electoral power could exponentially increase if they become politically energized.
“The political power of white Evangelicals has been well-reported in recent decades, but their numbers are shrinking while the number of the more liberal Nones is on the rise,” he added.
Despite the decades-long secularization trend in Western societies, traditionally devout South Dakotans, and Americans in general, remain a spiritually and supernaturally minded lot. Some 86% of Americans continue to “believe in a soul or spirit in addition to their physical body,” Pew reported.
Still, churches nationwide struggle to fill their pews.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/church-pews-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-24 08:56:09.349011

(Getty Images)A state road building program could face challenges related to federal funding.
Edward Austin, chief engineer with the Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT), told the Legislature’s Joint Transportation Oversight Committee Wednesday that the state faces significant transportation issues, particularly with the Alabama Transportation Rehabilitation and Improvement Program-II (ATRIP-II) which was approved for five years and is approaching its final year, because Congress couldn’t come to a consensus on the funding amount in the continuing resolution, dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” that passed in mid-July.
“The numbers you will see for this fund allocation plan from the federal side, the total dollar amounts are going to be pretty close to what you saw last year,” Austin said.

The ATRIP-II program — created by the Rebuild Alabama Act of 2019, which received increased federal funds from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law — is an ALDOT-administered grant program for transportation infrastructure projects in historically underserved areas. Austin said that the program is still receiving applications, with six to seven times the number the program can fund.
Eligible projects aim to improve state-maintained highway systems, with local roads and bridges only included if “incidental work that is necessary in order to complete the improvements to the state route,” Austin said. Any local governmental entity (county or municipality) within Alabama is eligible to apply, but project sponsors are limited to submitting one application per year.
Austin said that Congress passed a full year continuing resolution, providing funding for the last year of the approved program. But it won’t receive the 2% increase that the program has received yearly in the past, reverting to the amount from the previous fiscal year.
“We lost that 2% escalation this year, which is a meaningful number. That’s multiple projects that we could end up not being able to address because the funding is not there,” Austin said after the meeting, adding that the program’s future is uncertain until Congress authorizes another five year extension.
ATRIP-II has allocated or awarded funds to a wide array of transportation projects over the last five years. In FY 2020, 28 projects aimed at addressing intersection improvements and widening projects were awarded a total of $39.65 million, with ATRIP-II contributing $30.14 million and local governments providing $9.51 million. 
The program’s funding increased each year, with fiscal year 2021 seeing 27 projects totaling $46 million ($30.27 million from ATRIP-II), and FY 2022 funding 32 projects for $52.21 million ($40.31 million from ATRIP-II). In fiscal year 2023, 33 projects received $47.10 million with ATRIP-II providing $40.08 million and 26 projects were awarded $58.94 million in total, with $40.27 million from ATRIP-II, in fiscal year 2024. 
For the last fiscal year, which Gov. Kay Ivey announced in January, 24 projects were awarded a total of $56.48 million, with ATRIP-II contributing $40.19 million in federal funding.
Austin also discussed the Rebuild Alabama program, funded entirely with state dollars. He said that a priority for the project is to address 17 counties that do not have a four line connection to the interstate. He said that this lack of connectivity is a significant concern for locals.
“We can’t entice a good industry to come here, because whether it’s on time delivery or some other issue, if they’re constrained with only a two way route,” he said to the committee.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-83455071-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-07-24 08:56:09.349011

Sen. Sam Givhan, R-Huntsville, the sponsor of SB 11, said in a phone interview Tuesday that the bill’s purpose is to fill a gap in the appointing of electors.
“There are some deficiencies in the ‘what if,’” Givhan said. “I’m not aware of any issue of anybody in Alabama deviating from voting for the candidate that they were selected to vote for. But, there could be questions if someone died and how would that person be replaced?”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The bill was written by the Uniform Law Commission (ULC), a non-partisan group that drafts bills across the country. Givhan said he has served on the commission for three years, and this is the first bill he has deemed necessary for the state.
“We have a conference call with the staff of the Uniform Law Commission and talk about different bills that we might be willing to sponsor,” he said. “Some of them we don’t need, some of them we’ve already dealt with.”
Alabama awards all nine of its electoral votes to whichever candidate wins the most votes in the state in the presidential contest. The Republican nominee for the office has won the state’s votes in every election since 1980. 
The bill would require political parties to nominate an elector and an alternate to step in if the elector passes away between their nomination and the day the states cast electoral votes.
Under the legislation, electors would have to sign a pledge to mark their official ballots for the candidate of the party to which they are pledged. An elector who broke that pledge would vacate their position and be replaced by an alternate.  
A Washington state law fines faithless electors $1,000. In 2016, three electors in that state voted differently than they pledged, were fined, and challenged the fine under the First Amendment in a case known as Chiafalo v. Washington. The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that a state could constitutionally enforce a presidential elector’s pledge to support their party’s nominee, and the state voters’ choice, for president.
Kari Bearman, an attorney for ULC, said in an interview Wednesday morning that there have been isolated cases of electorates that have not cast their vote for President or Vice President in accordance with their state’s popular vote. 
“Historically, there have been a few instances of ‘faithless’ electors, but there have not been enough to change the outcome of a presidential election,” she wrote in an email Wednesday afternoon.
Thirteen states have passed the law, named the Uniform Faithful Presidential Electors Act, since 2011. 
Currently, the state Republican and Democratic parties select electors. Givhan said those nominees are “tried and true people.”
“We could have something like this pop up, but we have not in Alabama,” he said. “Other states might be different, but in Alabama I think the more practical aspect is how we deal with vacancies.”
Cam Ward, director of the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles, was on the committee that wrote the legislation, he said. He said in a phone interview Wednesday that the kinds of procedures the legislation creates is better to have before there is a faithless elector or a vacancy.
“You don’t want to wait until it happens till you address it,” he said. “You just want to make sure it’s as above board as it can be with regard to electors.”
While there is not a big fear of faithless electors in Alabama, he said, a tight election would be impacted by a vacancy or an elector that did not vote by the will of the state’s popular vote.
“If it’s a tight electoral count, you can find yourself in a real mess real quick,” he said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sam-Givhan-Feb-4-2025-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-07-24 08:56:09.349011

Haley Stevens at the Mackinac Policy Conference, May 30, 2024 | Anna Liz NicholsU.S. Rep. Haley Stevens has picked up a key endorsement in her campaign for Michigan’s open U.S. Senate seat. Defend the Vote, a national organization focused on safeguarding voting rights and strengthening democracy, announced its support for Stevens on Thursday.
“Haley Stevens understands the system is stacked against working people and that Michiganders have had enough,” Brian Lemek, the group’s executive director, said in a release Thursday. “She’ll fight to rebuild our democracy so it serves all of us, not just billionaires. We desperately need her energy, leadership, and change to get our country back on track.” 
Stevens (D-Birmingham) is among several high-profile Democrats seeking the nomination to run for U.S. Senate, including state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), former Michigan House Speaker Joe Tate (D-Detroit) and former Wayne County Health Director Abdul El-Sayed. On the Republican side, former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-White Lake) launched another bid, after losing to now-U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) by just over 19,000 votes in 2024. 
In response to the endorsement, Stevens emphasized her commitment to voting rights and democratic values.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“I’m proud to have Defend The Vote’s endorsement in my Senate campaign and look forward to working with them to protect all Michiganders’ personal freedoms and the sacred right to vote,” Stevens said. “There’s never been a more important time to defend our democracy and I will never back down from that fight.” 
Defend the Vote recently launched a $14 million cycle plan to elect pro-democracy candidates through direct donations, fundraising support, research, and on the ground and in-state campaign support. 
Last election cycle, the group said it helped elect 108 candidates across the country, including 75% of the candidates it endorsed.
In its endorsement, Defend the Vote said that Stevens would “fight to ensure our democracy responds to the needs of the people on issues like lowering costs and protecting access to health care.”

Thomson said this language was more specific and would allow rules like Prop12 to exist, but to only be enforceable on proteins raised in that state.","Members of a congressional agriculture committee discussed the “implications” of a California law dictating the size of livestock confinement pens, among other things. (Courtesy of the U.S. Department of Agriculture)The U.S. House Committee on Agriculture met Wednesday for a hearing and a renewed push to neutralize a California law that stipulates the living conditions of certain livestock
The law, referred to as Proposition 12, has been the subject of several lawsuits and proposed legislation as opponents say the law creates a “patchwork” of “uncertainty” in the industry.
In late June, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a case against Proposition 12. Witnesses at the House hearing said the dismissal does not equate to a ruling from the court, but instead shows the need for congressional action on the issue.
Proposition 12 was a state referendum approved in 2018 that took effect in 2024. The law stipulates meat sold in the state must comply with state animal confinement regulations, even if the animals were raised outside of California.
This means if an Iowa producer, for example, wanted to sell uncooked pork cuts into the California market, their pork must have been raised in a setting where sows had at least 24 square feet of room. Eggs would have to come from chickens that were raised with at least 1 square foot of space to comply with the California law.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Protein sold to states other than California do not need to comply, but industry leaders say the California pork market is too large to ignore.
Animal rights organizations in support of the law say the spacing stipulations would give the animals enough space to turn around freely and provide greater welfare to the animals.
Lawmakers have attempted to block the law several times. The Ending Agricultural Trade Suppression (EATS) Act in 2023 attempted to stop states from enforcing preharvest conditions on agricultural products for sale in interstate commerce settings. Opponents of the bill argued it would not only suppress Prop 12, but also interfere with many state-based agricultural laws.
Ag committee Chairman Glenn “G.T.” Thomson of Pennsylvania, said lawmakers should look instead to the language from the House’s Farm Bill proposal from last year, which did not pass. Thomson said this language was more specific and would allow rules like Prop12 to exist, but to only be enforceable on proteins raised in that state.
“In order to protect the right of American farmers and ranchers to raise their animals how they see fit, we must provide a fix for Proposition 12,” Thomson said in his opening comments.
At the Wednesday hearing, pork producers said the bigger confinements required by the law don’t always work in favor of the sows and the cost to comply with California’s law is high for producers and consumers.
Pat Hord, an Ohio pork producer and vice president of the National Pork Producers Council, has outfitted parts of his operation to be compliant with Prop 12. He said the law and the potential for the 49 other states to enact their own standards “threatens” his farm with an “unmitigated regulatory patchwork.”
Hord supported congressional action that would stop Proposition 12 and prevent future states from following suit.
An economist with NPPC who also testified Wednesday said it costs farmers $3,500 to $4,500 per sow to build compliant pens. Hord said the law is not only costly to comply with, but is “inherently less efficient.”
“All farms have or will continue to experience productivity losses under Prop 12,” Hord said to the committee. “You simply cannot house the same number of sows in the same size barn.”
Hord said the burden to comply would be even greater on small and medium sized farmers who have less capital to spend on costly upgrades. This in turn, he said, would lead to more consolidation in the pork market.
 Animal welfare

The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, or ASPCA, said in a press release that laws like Proposition 12 “challenge” the “cruel status quo” of industrial agriculture.
“Contrary to the narrative being pushed by industrial agriculture interests at today’s hearing – which notably excluded the voices of independent farmers – there are thousands of farmers across the country who support and depend on commonsense bans against the cruel confinement of farm animals,” ASPCA President and CEO Matt Bershadker said in the release. “We encourage Congress to listen to these farmers and protect state laws like Proposition 12 which create vital market opportunities for higher-welfare farming that align with the values of the American public.
ASPCA said the Senate’s recently introduced “Food Security and Farm Protection Act” was a repackaging of the EATS act and must be kept out of the upcoming Farm Bill.
The animal rights group said bills like EATS are an “unprecedented federal assault” on states’ rights to pass laws on agricultural practices and sales.

Matt Schuiteman, an Iowa pork producer and board member with Iowa Farm Bureau, said the best animal welfare comes when farmers are able to adjust their operations to their individual conditions and to their animals. This is something he said Proposition 12 would make more difficult to do.
“The most important thing I’ve learned from a lifetime of raising pigs is that it’s critical for producers to have full control over the environment in which their pigs are raised,” Schuiteman said.
He also said when breeding pigs are not confined, the social hierarchy within a herd kicks in and pigs down the pecking order are pushed away from food or water. This is not only bad for the sow, but also means she’ll have smaller litters, which hurts the farmer’s outputs.
U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, said the poor outcomes for pigs under the law show California is “clueless” about hog farming.
“This all happens because California has a liberal, progressive agenda that has no idea what farming is all about,” Feenstra said. “Let’s be clear, Prop 12 is a direct threat to our viability of family farms, the health and welfare of animals and the affordability of pork production in America.”
U.S. Rep. Jim McGovern, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said the whole hearing was a “misrepresentation of reality” and the panel of witnesses was “not a balanced panel.”
McGovern said there are “thousands” of farmers who support Proposition 12 and many small-operation producers who have benefited from the new market opportunities for “humanely raised meat” under the law.
“If you kill Prop 12, you are putting independent family farms at risk,” McGovern said. “It will be get big or get out all over again.”
Recent data from U.S. Department of Agriculture shows about 27% of U.S. hog farms already compliant with Prop 12, or are in the process of becoming compliant with the law.
The data, according to an analysis from Politico, said pork prices in California are nearly 20% higher than they were this time last year.
Lilly Rocha, executive director of the Latino Restaurant Association, said these higher prices impact small family businesses in the state, make it more difficult for consumers to buy pork or pork products, which distances Latino customers from their cultural heritage.
 GOP governors support rollback of Prop 12

Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, along with seven GOP governors, submitted a letter to members of Congress Wednesday, urging them to support the Save Our Bacon act, introduced earlier in the day by U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson of Iowa.
Hinson, in a social media post on X, said the bill would “push back on California’s radical Prop 12.”
The letter from state governors called the California regulations “arbitrary” and “out of touch,” especially as it drives up production prices across the country and consumer pork prices in the state.
“When one state decides to regulate another, federal legislation is appropriate and necessary,” the letter said. “We ask that Congress make clear that each state may regulate livestock production within its own borders, but not the production of livestock in other states.”
In addition to Reynolds, the letter was signed by governors from Mississippi, Indiana, Nebraska, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma and Virginia.
The Trump administration has also sued the State of California and its officials for the impact the law has had on egg prices in the state. This lawsuit came shortly after the Supreme Court’s dismissal.
In closing, Thompson said the courts have shown “this is a responsibility Congress has to fix.”
“This committee will consider a measured correction that preserves states’ rights to control their internal agriculture practices,” Thompson said. “We’ll protect interstate commerce and preserve states’ animal health regulations and laws.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/USDA-sow-and-piglets-1024x679.jpg,,,2025-07-24 07:56:20.320268

This hits close to home. On July 21, Winooski School District Superintendent Wilmer Chavarria was detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection for over 5 hours. Despite being a U.S. citizen and being married to a U.S. citizen, he was harassed, bullied, mocked, denied contact with anyone and ordered to hand over his work computer and passwords. 
As we are seeing now, President Trump’s vitriol and policies were never about illegal immigration. They were never about setting up new structures and laws to have a more equitable system to bring workers to our country and protect asylum seekers and refugees. His administration’s cruel tactics are psychological terror, designed to have us cowering — designed to pit us against each other and to sow racism and hatred, to blame the “other” for any and all problems.

Are you currently receiving an Affordable Care Act federal subsidy for your health insurance premium in 2025? If you’re not already aware, your health care premiums will double or triple in 2026 due to the ACA subsidies not being extended by the federal government. The federal legislature could extend them before the end of the year, which is unlikely — and we certainly can’t count on it. 
This week marks the start of the health insurance rate review and hospital budget process for 2026. There is a public meeting regarding the proposed insurance 2026 premium increases scheduled for today, July 24, from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. I would encourage everyone — patients, small business owners, outpatient health care providers, as well as those in hospital and network leadership positions — to attend. We are facing another year of increases and our health care premiums are already the highest in the country. We the public need to show up to this virtual meeting to make a difference this year, now more than ever.

If Vermonters are angry and discouraged about premiums going up every year with no decrease in sight, the Green Mountain Care Board and hospital leadership need to hear from you, especially if you are experiencing affordability issues due to your premium or as a patient. If you are not available to attend this virtual meeting or aren’t comfortable doing so publicly, please share and submit your story in writing to the Board. You can submit your comment anonymously, to be shared publicly or privately, with the Green Mountain Care Board. They read all comments in full. The deadline for a written submission is July 28. 
I would also encourage hospital leadership teams from around the state to listen to the financial pain and stress experienced by working Vermonters who are struggling to afford premiums, let alone any bill from any medical office. All Vermonters want is a fighting chance to survive financially when the subsidies go away next year — both as individuals and as small businesses, the latter of which will not survive if we continue down this path. 
Most people can’t afford more than they already are paying. Many Vermonters will have to choose between an outrageous premium with a high deductible or willingly risk going without insurance due to their lack of funds. Many Vermont employers don’t have the additional margin to cover the increases on their own. All I’m asking is for one hour of your time or for you to share your story directly with the Green Mountain Care Board if you can’t attend. Please join this call. This is most likely our last chance to voice our opinion. If we fail to show up, we have no one to blame but ourselves.

Conservation goals in Vermont will be at risk if the current wildlife governance model does not evolve.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Brenna Galdenzi: Create a more humane Vermont for wildlife.","This commentary is by Brenna Galdenzi of Stowe, president and co-founder of Protect Our Wildlife. She also serves on the Board of the Vermont Humane Federation and on the Advisory Committee of Wildlife for All.


We’ve all seen the videos — bears lounging in a hammock, coyotes playing with tennis balls, otters sliding down a snowy embankment — clear reminders that wild animals are capable of a wide range of emotions, not so different from our own. That’s why Protect Our Wildlife focuses on securing stronger protections for individual wild animals, recognizing that they feel happiness, pain, fear, sadness and so much more.
While some nonprofits prioritize conserving land that’s often used for public recreational uses — including hunting and trapping — our work is different. Vermont Fish & Wildlife’s game and furbearer biologists primarily aim to maintain “sustainable” populations of moose, bobcats, bears and other species for hunters and trappers to harvest. In contrast, our focus is on the animals themselves — sentient beings who are too often reduced to mere resources and subjected to antiquated and exceptionally cruel practices. 
There is no justifiable reason why, in 2025, Vermont still allows morally objectionable and inherently cruel recreational pursuits. Why do we still allow bobcats, foxes and other animals to be caught in steel-jawed leghold traps — devices now rebranded as “Best Management Practice” traps to soften public perception?
Why does Vermont Fish & Wildlife continue to allow hunters to unleash packs of powerful hounds into our forests for six months of the year to chase down bears, all in the name of recreation? Hounders are allowed to train their hunting dogs not only on bears, but also on bobcats and other wildlife during times of year when they are rearing their young. Conflicts between hounders and private property owners are documented every year since marauding hounds can’t read posted signs.
Beavers are finally getting the recognition they deserve, but they’re still treated as vermin by Vermont Fish & Wildlife. Beavers play a vital ecological role by building dams that create wetlands and ponds — natural infrastructure that improves water quality, reduces flood risks and supports biodiversity. Yet Fish & Wildlife allows recreational trappers to kill an unlimited number of beavers for five months each year, potentially robbing our lands of ecologically significant wetlands that thrive with heron, moose, amphibians and imperiled species like the wood turtle.
Eastern coyotes, who fill the critical ecological role once occupied by wolves, can be hunted 365 days a year in Vermont — with no bag limits, no reporting requirements and even at night over bait piles. A recent bill before the legislature sought to ban hunting coyotes, bobcats and other furbearer species over bait piles and Fish & Wildlife fought that, even after hearing testimony from a woman whose dog was mistaken for a coyote and shot and killed at a bait pile by a neighbor in Vermont. 
Sportsmens’ lobbyists routinely circle the Statehouse, claiming their “traditions” are under attack by so-called “animal rights activists” — an effort to dismiss and marginalize a growing constituency by painting them as fringe. But let’s be clear: these so-called activists include mothers, teachers, biologists and even hunters — people who are simply frustrated by laws that feel increasingly out of step with 21st century values. We also question the sportsmens’ logic of using norms from 200 years ago to justify today’s practices. 
These outdated trapping and hunting policies do not reflect the majority of the people. And with hunting and trapping license sales steadily declining, perhaps Vermont Fish & Wildlife and the governor will finally recognize the importance of working meaningfully with wildlife advocates. Conservation goals in Vermont will be at risk if the current wildlife governance model does not evolve. The question is: will they have the courage to modernize, to create a more humane Vermont for wildlife — and a more inclusive one where diverse voices are finally heard?

(Photo by David McNew/Getty Images)Minnesotans were recently met with hazy, choking air due to smoke from wildfires blazing through Canada. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency issued air quality warnings, and in some places, officials cautioned even the healthiest residents to stay inside. 
But in some parts of the state, under all that smoke is a more permanent threat to air quality — toxic chemicals released into the air by manufacturing or mining processes. 
Areas surrounding St. Cloud and northwest of the city, as well as southern parts of the state around Albert Lea, have some of the highest rates of air toxins in the entire nation, according to EJScreen, a mapping tool previously maintained by the EPA and now run by nonprofit Public Environmental Data Partners. 



But when it comes to air toxins, those two specific regions are the exceptions. 
These chemicals, also known as hazardous air pollutants, are a part of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Toxic Release Inventory, or TRI, which is a list of nearly 800 chemicals that come from manufacturing, metal mining, electric power generation, chemical manufacturing and hazardous waste treatment. They are nationally regulated, and facilities that produce significant amounts of them must report their emissions. 

“They can cause things like cancer outcomes,” said Jesse Berman, an associate professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Minnesota. “But the thing about hazardous air pollutants is they are not ubiquitous. They’re not found everywhere. They’re primarily from manufacturing sources, and they’re going to be in much smaller quantities.”
On the state level, up until recently, Minnesota did not have strong requirements for those facilities.
That changed in 2023, when the Legislature included new reporting requirements for these types of air toxins in the 7-county metro as a part of a larger environmental spending package. 
The MPCA is undergoing rulemaking to determine the specifics of regulating these toxins; enforcement will follow. The agency has three years to modify permits based on those new regulations.
“The rules are intended to regulate air toxics in the Twin Cities metro area and consider environmental justice area residents’ exposure to facilities’ air toxics emissions,” a MPCA spokesperson wrote, adding that they anticipate draft rules by May 2026. 
The Legislature and the MPCA have not always been on the same page about how to enforce air toxin regulations, however. 
“Ever since I got in the Legislature, until now, the (MPCA) has said that we don’t need to actually do what we did in this proposal or to regulate, because the commissioner already had the authority to investigate and do the work to protect Minnesotans,” said Rep. Fue Lee, a St. Paul Democrat. His constituents called for him to push for stricter air regulations, he said. 
Even within the 7-county metro region covered by the 2023 bill, some local organizers hope to see the MPCA doing more. 
Mateo Frumholtz, a University of Minnesota graduate student and Twin Cities environmental activist, cited facilities within the region that posed significant health risks to residents, including the Smith Foundry in the Minneapolis neighborhood of East Phillips that was shut down by the EPA for failing to control its pollution; and the Northern Iron Foundry in St. Paul, which is in a dispute with the MPCA over its permit due to non-compliance with air quality standards. In both cases, Frumholtz said, neighbors had fought long and hard to have existing pollution standards enforced by state and federal officials.   
Under the new rules, however, the regions of the state with the greatest toxic air releases won’t face new regulations; manufacturers like Pro Manufacturing, a metal manufacturer in Albert Lea, and Polar Tank Trailer, a trailer manufacturer in Holdingford just outside St. Cloud, will be exempt from any of these new rules. 
Greater Minnesota legislators concerned with protecting manufacturing jobs in their regions opposed expanding the new regulations beyond the metro, Lee said. “It is my hope that in the near future, that we can actually make this statewide,” he added. 
Pro Manufacturing and Polar Tank Trailer hold the highest of what’s known as a risk-screening environmental indicators score, or RSEI score, in their respective counties, indicating high potential for harmful health risks. Both release chromium and its compounds, which are associated with lung cancer and nasal and sinus cancer. 
(Neither company, nor the mayors of St. Cloud and Albert Lea, returned inquiries from the Reformer.) 
In the counties with high TRI releases, two other chemicals are even more prevalent. Styrene, found in petroleum and natural gas, is a major risk factor in Stearns County. In Freeborn County, the highest air releases are from methanol, a highly flammable liquid used in aerosol cans. 



But factories with chromium, like Pro Manufacturing and Polar Tank Trailer, have the highest potential to cause serious health risks in their communities.
Williams, the U scientist, said Minnesota needs more precise measurements as well as more data on the specific health impacts of those chemicals. While the EPA and MPCA are doing some of that reporting, more can be done, he said.
“I think for most neighborhoods in most places, we just don’t know what we’re being exposed to. We don’t know what’s being released. We don’t know where it’s coming from. We don’t know what’s happening to it while it’s in the air. We don’t know how much is making it into our homes,” he said. 


 

Berman said piloting the new regulations in the metro is prudent. “Sometimes having a targeted regulation can be a good thing. As a public health person, we want to avoid leaving people out, but sometimes you have to make decisions where you can help a very large proportion of the population, especially when they might be at greater risk.”
These new rules are coming even as the Trump administration is rolling back a number of key environmental protections. A new policy would allow coal plants and other industrial facilities with high pollution rates to petition the White House directly for an exemption from Biden-era Clean Air Act rules.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-1603280.jpg,,,2025-07-24 07:56:20.320268

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Fewer than 52% of Indiana high school graduates from the Class of 2023 went directly to college, according to the latest data quietly released by the Indiana Commission for Higher Education.
That’s the state’s lowest rate in recent history and a continued decline from its previous plateau.
Just 51.7% of 2023 graduates, about 39,000 students, enrolled in college within a year of finishing high school, data showed. That’s down from a steady 53% between 2020 and 2022, and far below the state’s peak of 65% a decade ago.
Around 36% of all graduating seniors enrolled in one of Indiana’s public four-year institutions, followed by 8% who chose a private college or university.
Another 7.6% went to a school outside of Indiana, according to the data.
The figures, posted to the agency’s website earlier this month, reflect concerns state leaders have long expressed about Indiana’s declining college-going culture, especially as the state shifts focus toward career credentials and work-based learning.


“The startling drop in our college-going rate yet again can be credited to the lack of two things: money and morale,” said Rep. Ed DeLaney, D-Indianapolis, in a statement released Wednesday.
“While our governor has been taking a victory lap for getting our state universities to freeze tuition, he has failed to guarantee that his move will not decrease financial aid and scholarship opportunities,” DeLaney continued. “Any lack of opportunity for tuition support will lead to more Hoosiers not being able to afford college and being forced to choose a different path.”
The 2023 numbers come just six months after the higher education commission approved sweeping changes to Indiana’s high school diploma, set to take effect statewide in 2029, that emphasize work-based learning and career readiness over traditional college preparation.
High schoolers will be required to earn at least one “diploma seal” to graduate, including options for employment or postsecondary readiness. While some seal options are specifically geared toward college-bound students, graduates will no longer be required to complete all the coursework or meet other criteria typically expected for college admission.
 Rep. Ed DeLaney, D-Indianapolis, sits in the House Education Committee on Wednesday, Feb. 12, 2025. (Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
DeLaney maintained that Republican leaders “have been devaluing the opportunities that our colleges and universities can offer students.”
“At the same time, the supermajority has made attacking colleges and universities the centerpiece of their culture war agenda — from policing what can be taught in the classroom, to forcing institutions to eliminate hundreds of degree options, to creating an entirely new high school diploma that emphasizes the path directly into the workforce,” the lawmaker said.
“Trying to bury this report in a website and not send a press release is a telling sign that the Commission on Higher Education knows this does not look good, and does not act to fix it,” DeLaney added. “It simply isn’t important enough to them. They are busy eliminating college courses and creating new tests. This is what the legislature has asked them to do.”
CHE has not issued a press release on the latest data and did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
Indiana’s college-going rate has dropped more than any other state tracked by the National Center for Education Statistics over the past 15 years.
Previously, Indiana reached a college-going rate of 65%.
“We set a goal to get it back when it slumped,” DeLaney recalled. “Now, it doesn’t seem like we care to address the issue. That is a shame for our students, a shame for our economy, and a shame for our state.”
Earlier this year, Republican lawmakers passed additional legislation requiring public colleges to eliminate low-enrollment degree programs. So far, Indiana’s public colleges and universities have collectively cut or consolidated more than 400 academic degree programs.
“The supermajority has been in power for 20 years and this is their achievement,” DeLaney said. “At some point we have to ask ourselves: is a declining college-going rate not the result they want?”
By the numbers
According to the numbers published on CHE’s online college-going dashboard, the vast majority of 2023 grads who continued their education earned some form of college credit while still in high school: 85.6% of college-goers took and passed an Advanced Placement exam; 64.6% earned dual credit; 90.7% earned the Indiana College Core diploma, which comes with a block of 30 general education credits that can be transferred to and accepted at colleges across the state; 86.3% earned as associate’s degree; and 63.6% earned another type of credential.
A quarter of postsecondary enrollees, 25%, are seeking STEM-related degrees, while:

17.8% enrolled in business and communications programs
16% enrolled in health programs
11% enrolled in social and behavioral sciences and human services programs
9.9% enrolled in arts and humanities programs
7.4% enrolled in trades programs
5.8% enrolled in education programs
7% were undecided

College-going among male students dropped to 45%, compared to 59% for female students — widening an existing gender gap.
Among racial groups, Asian and white students had the highest college-going rates, at 70.7% and 54%, respectively. The college-going rates among other racial groups lagged, though, at 45.5% for Black students, and 41.7% for Hispanic students.
Indiana colleges cut hundreds of low-enrollment degree programs ahead of state mandate

The rate for students from low-income backgrounds — as measured by eligibility for free or reduced lunch — was 38.7%, compared to about 60% for their higher-income peers.
More than 78% of college-bound graduates from the 2023 cohort were part of Indiana’s 21st Century Scholars program, according the the new data. The scholarship fund covers full tuition and fees at Indiana colleges and universities for low-income students, who enroll in the 8th grade.
Also previewed in the data was an update on the Class of 2022.
The CHE dashboard showed 53% of the 2022 cohort that enrolled in a postsecondary program within a year after high school graduation met all three early college success benchmarks: ​​they did not need remediation; they completed all courses they attempted during their first year of enrollment; and they persisted to their second year of schooling.
According to the latest numbers, 77.5% of the 2022 cohort that enrolled in a postsecondary program persisted to the second year.

A University of Illinois Springfield study examines implementation of Illinois’ media literacy law. 
The post Media literacy education lacks consistency across Illinois appeared first on Capitol News Illinois","Article Summary

Three years ago, the state mandated that K-12 schools teach media literacy.
But the law did not create statewide oversight or provide funding for curriculum.
A University of Illinois Springfield study conducted last year shows significant disparities in how school districts across the state implement the law.

This summary was written by the editors who worked on this story.

SPRINGFIELD — A survey of Illinois educators reveals a significant disparity in how they interpret a three-year-old state law’s requirement to teach high school students a “unit of instruction” on media literacy.
About one-third of respondents to a survey conducted by the University of Illinois Springfield indicated they spend more than one class period but no more than one week covering the topic, while about 29 percent spend more than three weeks’ worth of class periods. Sixteen percent of schools surveyed discuss media literacy during a single class period over the course of a full school year.
Illinois became the first state in the nation to require public high schools to teach media literacy, which can include lessons on accessing information, analyzing and evaluating media messages, reflecting on how media affects the consumption of information and triggers emotions, and how to engage in thoughtful conversations with people using facts and reason. The state-mandated lessons began with the 2022-2023 school year.
A key feature of the law is its “bottom-up approach” that gives local schools flexibility to design and deliver media literacy lessons as they see fit, said Yonty Friesem, an associate professor at Columbia College Chicago and a co-founder of Illinois Media Literacy Coalition, a group that helped develop a media literacy education framework that teachers could use to build lessons in wake of the new law.

Survey response data
Click a question below to see how the school districts responded.





Did your school teach these concepts before the law? 








If media literacy was taught before the law, how does your current unit compare to your pre-law unit? 








How much emphasis do you put on the five pillars of media literacy as outlined in the state law? 








What kind of assessment do you use to measure media literacy knowledge? 








How long does a media literacy unit last in your class? 








How many times will a student who attends all four years of high school in your building encounter a media literacy unit? 








Our media literacy unit is delivered to... 




While the local-control approach made the legislation more politically palatable, the flexibility brings major differences in what the students learn.
“We definitely don’t see the impact that we wanted to see,” Friesem said of the law.
He recalled being asked to speak about media literacy in a high school class. The session lasted an hour.
“That was the unit of instruction,” Friesem said. “Which, yes, they’re correct, it is. But I would prefer it to be a little bit longer.”
Media literacy findings
Further illustrating Illinois schools’ variations on how they handle media literacy education, the UIS survey, taken in spring 2024, found:

Less than 82 percent of teachers said high school freshmen received media literacy instruction at their schools. That percentage decreases as students get older. Seniors received the training at 63 percent of the schools.
One-third of educators reported a student who attends their high school for all four years will experience a media literacy lesson four or more times. Another one-third of teachers say their students will see just one lesson over their four years in high school.

In Springfield, students are receiving the lessons in a variety of ways. Mike Havener, a library media specialist at Springfield High School, one of three public high schools in the capital city, arranges with other teachers to bring their classes to the library so Havener can offer a session that covers media literacy. But even then, he doesn’t see every student in the building.
“I am not reaching with fidelity every student,” he said. “I mean, we range between high 1,300s to almost 1,500 students and just to get that quantity of kids through the library (for these lessons) … that is not happening. I can say that I do see every student in some capacity. But that’s not always me teaching a media literacy lesson. They’re coming in for English. They’re coming in to get a book. … I try to sneak it in as much as possible. There are other teachers in the building that do teach media literacy as part of their normal coursework.”
For Heather Danek, who teaches public speaking courses at Minooka Community High School in the Chicago suburbs, media literacy lessons in her classroom are “interwoven throughout the class. It’s not just a one-and-done situation for me.”
“We start within the very first unit talking about meeting the needs of an audience and audience expectations which I think is part of media literacy and thinking about the information that you’re using to create a point, thinking about the way that you’re building an argument using information,” said Danek, who serves on the Illinois Media Literacy Coalition. “And then, as we get further into like research projects, then I do more of the nuts and bolts of things like the true analysis of sources, looking at quality places to find information.”
‘It’s a pedagogy’
That approach — working media literacy into the everyday educational process — is what will make the lessons most effective, said Michael Spikes, the other co-founder of the Illinois Media Literacy Coalition and a lecturer at Northwestern University.
“It’s a pedagogy,” he said. “… Not so much like you got to go take the media literacy class, or you do media literacy when you have the unit, like what we have in the policy. … It’s a way of seeing the world the way you move through (it) more than just saying it’s just a subject that you learn.”
To that end, the UIS survey showed schools are working media literacy lessons into a variety of courses.
Nearly 60 percent of respondents said the lessons are included in English courses, 47 percent in history/social studies, 33 percent in business classes, 29 percent in literature and 18 percent in civics. Just more than 16 percent of schools said they deliver the lesson in a separate media literacy course.
Danek said she sees her students displaying media literacy skills, including being more aware of the quality of the information they’re using and being able to find reputable sources in trustworthy places.
Lack of statewide oversight, funding
Still, a deficiency in the law, Danek said, is a lack of statewide oversight to ensure compliance in classrooms throughout Illinois, which leaves many schools, including hers, implementing the law on a “hit or miss” basis.
“If I had this conversation with any curriculum director, or any building principal in the state of Illinois, I would hear the same answer,” she said. “… I think the challenges are communication. … How do we get the message out to people that they need to and should be doing this, and then how do we provide them with the necessary tools in order to do it?”
Another deficiency: The state didn’t set aside funds to train teachers to teach media literacy.
“I mean, it’s basically an unfunded mandate, right?” Danek said. “There wasn’t really any money put behind it. So, I think if you want a law that has some teeth, there has to be some money because you’re gonna need to identify ability, the opportunities for professional development.”
Other states’ policies
Just as Illinois school districts employ a variety of methods to teach media literacy, states around the country do, too.
As of the end of 2023, 19 state legislatures had approved bills or resolutions concerning “K-12 media literacy or digital citizenship education,” according to a policy report by Media Literacy Now, a group that pushes for the subject to be taught in public schools.
A study published in 2023 by University of Kentucky professor Daniela Kruel DiGiacomo and others examined state-level legislation and found the measures lack consistency in terms of substance, scope and intended implications.
Most legislation focuses on safety and civility in online environments but fails to address equity concerns adequately. Moreover, there is a notable lack of support in terms of funding, teacher training, and clear definitions of media literacy terms. The study underscores the need for comprehensive and coherent policy frameworks to effectively integrate media literacy education into the curriculum.
Back in Illinois, educators say identifying the skills of teachers and assessing the implementation of the law more comprehensively is another step toward making improvements.
While the UIS survey offers snapshots into outcomes, a statewide assessment is something those interviewed see as a necessary step, perhaps coming from the Illinois State Board of Education.
“Students have to pass a Constitution test to graduate,” Havener, the Springfield High faculty member, said. “I think there should be a media literacy test and that it has equal importance in weight in order for kids to graduate.”
Partisan divide
Another way to promote buy-in on media literacy across the state is for educators to fully explain to the public what it entails. Many people, educators say, equate media literacy to fact-checking and news literacy, one part of which is news consumers learning about biases that specific news organizations might have.
Those discussions often become lightning rods for political conflict and create the distrust each party’s faithful have for certain media outlets such as FOX News or MSNBC.
There was definitely a partisan divide in the Illinois legislature’s vote in 2021 on House Bill 234, which created the media literacy education law. In the House, the vote was strictly partisan, with all 68 “yes” votes coming from Democrats and the 44 “no” votes coming from Republicans. In the Senate, which passed the bill 42-15, three Republicans crossed over to vote in favor along with Democrats.
Illinois Republicans who opposed the measure in 2021, however, spoke in a legislative committee meeting about their beliefs against creating a statewide curricular mandate and didn’t specifically speak against the concept of media literacy.
Friesem said the full concept of media literacy goes beyond the news.
“The main pushback from conservatives is that (media literacy) is liberal indoctrination, which is the exact opposite, because real media literacy … is to learn to ask questions,” he said. “… So it’s not about if you’re conservative or liberal, you’re media literate or you’re not media literate. It’s about … questioning who is in power, why they’re there, why they’re sending those messages, why people who are not in power are sending those messages, the context.”
Dr. Ann Strahle is interim associate dean and a professor in the College of Public Affairs and Education at the University of Illinois Springfield. Jason Piscia is an associate professor and director of UIS’ Public Affairs Reporting program. The UIS survey was conducted in spring 2024 by contacting more than 750 high school principals at Illinois’ public high schools, asking them or other faculty at their schools to fill out a 19-question survey about how the media education law is being implemented in their building. Forty-nine responses, all anonymous, were received.

(Micah Drew/ Daily Montanan)The news is filled with stories of how the Trump administration and its so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have fired thousands of federal employees who work for our public land agencies. Though Donald Trump had been talking about gutting the federal workforce, the way it was done without regard for how it would affect the agencies’ ability to carry out their responsibilities came as quite a shock.
As one U.S. Forest Service wilderness ranger wrote in a recent Wilderness Watch blog:

        “The dust has had time to settle, and we can now assess the damage. All probationary Forest Service employees in ‘non-fire’ positions were fired. There are almost no wilderness rangers left in my state and many of my neighboring states. Beyond Wilderness, there are almost no field-going recreation employees left. The temporaries are gone, the permanent seasonals are gone. Without staff, many ranger districts will struggle to even utilize volunteers.”    
In a recent meeting that Wilderness Watch attended, the Forest Service described the impacts of cuts to the Alpine Lakes Wilderness in central Washington. The popular and spectacular Enchantments area of the Wilderness typically has 10 to 12 wilderness rangers each summer who patrol and clean up after the 100,000 visitors that descend on the area each year. This year there will be only one wilderness ranger, who will have to share their time between the Enchantments and another 150,000 acres of Wilderness on the ranger district. It’s an utterly impossible task that will result in significant damage to these priceless lands. Similar stories are playing out in other wildernesses as the Trump cuts kick in.
The layoffs, firings, and forced early retirements didn’t just hit field-going crews. For the Forest Service, the national program leader has left, and eight of the nine regional offices are now without wilderness staff. Major cuts have hit Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service programs as well. The combination of chaotic firings and early retirements means the most experienced agency wilderness people are now gone.
Yet the untold story is that the downfall of wilderness programs has been a long time in the making. By the time Trump and Musk started recklessly eliminating jobs, wilderness was one of the areas already hardest hit—not because of sheer numbers laid off or fired, but because there were already relatively few wilderness staff left. This is especially true for the Forest Service, which historically had far and away the most robust wilderness program, but has been gradually shrinking its wilderness crews for years.
The Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness (SBW) straddling the Bitterroot Mountains along the Montana-Idaho border is a case in point. At more than 1.3 million acres, the SBW is the third largest national forest wilderness in the entire country. In the early 1990s, the SBW had nine permanent wilderness rangers, eight seasonal wilderness rangers, an entire ranger district—the Moose Creek Ranger District—dedicated solely to the SBW, and a wilderness coordinator for the wilderness programs across the six ranger districts and three national forests that oversee the SBW. By 2019, however, this robust wilderness program had dwindled to just three permanent and one seasonal wilderness rangers. The coordinator position was gone, and the Moose Creek District had been merged with an adjacent multiple-use district.
Last fall, things got even worse, even before DOGE and Trump, when then-Forest Service Chief Randy Moore announced that in 2025 there would be no hiring of temporary (seasonal) employees—a group that has historically made up a significant number of wilderness rangers and trail crew. For many wildernesses, Moore’s edict was going to result in no field presence at all. And numbers tell only part of the story. What was also being lost was decades of institutional knowledge, the traditional skills necessary to steward wilderness, and a voice within the agencies standing up for wilderness when harmful projects are planned.
Wilderness Watch had raised this concern for decades, but it had been ignored by agency leaders, Congress, and the media. The Forest Service, and to a lesser extent the BLM, tried to cover up their lack of commitment to their wilderness programs by bringing on volunteers to replace professional, seasoned rangers. But now there aren’t enough rangers to even manage the volunteers, so in most cases much of that help is now gone, too.
So, what can be done? In the short term, we can hope that the recent DOGE firings will be reversed, either by the courts or by urging our elected officials to restore funding for the agency programs. That could help hold off some of the damage that will undoubtedly occur during the next few years.
Longer term: We need a durable response to the decades-long neglect and animus toward wilderness that, for many years, has been the hallmark of the four agencies that manage wilderness. We need a fundamental change to how wilderness is administered and safeguarded across the land.
Twenty-five years ago, the four federal land agencies commissioned the Pinchot Institute for Conservation to do an assessment of their wilderness programs. The panel consisted of a number of wilderness luminaries, and it took input from wilderness conservationists and wilderness critics around the country. But it spent most of its time talking with federal agency wilderness leaders themselves. The report recognized the unique challenges of protecting and preserving wilderness and the dedication of many of the staff involved, but nonetheless concluded that the agencies’ collective lack of commitment would lead to the eventual loss of the Wilderness System.
One of the panelists, former Secretary of Interior Stewart Udall, who served in both Congress and the Cabinet (as well as on the Wilderness Watch board of directors), was unequivocal in his conclusion that the four land management agencies weren’t up to the task. He urged the panel to recommend that the overarching responsibilities for Wilderness be placed in a new agency, one dedicated solely to the wilderness task. In calling for creating a new “National Wilderness Service,” Udall wrote:

        “We must show the courage to suggest and promote alternatives that will create real change. We should pursue them with the energy and boldness of people like Bob Marshall and Howard Zahniser, who promoted an idea that seemed extreme in their day, but that most Americans now take for granted.”    
When the dust settles, attempting to recreate the situation that existed prior to the Trump raids would be a fool’s errand, destined to condemn our precious National Wilderness Preservation System to the dustbin of history. Rather, we should see the near total elimination of the current failing programs as an opportunity to create something much better, a new entity that is passionate about the challenge of protecting and preserving our incomparable National Wilderness Preservation System. Udall’s call for a National Wilderness Service totally dedicated to that cause, and filled with public servants truly committed to that charge, is a great place to start.

(Photo by Mike Stobe/Getty Images)The Trump administration’s contempt for the law and for the people of New Jersey is on full display yet again in the new fight over control of the U.S. Attorney’s Office.
With its push to keep a Trump loyalist as our state’s chief federal prosecutor, the White House is not only ignoring the law, but also tarnishing the reputation of judges appointed by both Republican and Democratic presidents and sowing chaos in a state that’s already seeing enough chaos these days, thank you very much.
Here are the details: Alina Habba, a personal attorney for President Donald Trump, was appointed interim U.S. attorney back in March, but her 120-day appointment expires this week and Trump only just nominated her for confirmation by the U.S. Senate, so her nomination has yet to move. Federal law says the state’s federal judges can name her replacement until the Senate votes to confirm her, so on Tuesday they announced they chose Habba’s deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace.
The judges did not say why they rejected the Trump administration’s push to keep Habba in the post. I have some ideas:

Her public slobbering over alleged sex trafficker Andrew Tate in January.
Her stated pledge to use her job as prosecutor to help get Republicans elected in New Jersey.
Her prosecution of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a case that was so nakedly partisan she had to drop it mere days later.
Her announcement of an investigation into our governor and attorney general on Fox News, a probe that she appears to have created just so she could go viral.
Her subpoena of Gov. Phil Murphy over some dumb but obviously not criminal comments he made in February suggesting he might hide an undocumented immigrant at his home.

Whatever the reason, federal law gives our district judges the power to choose the U.S. attorney when the president’s nominee is not confirmed. So they did, and now the Trump administration is accusing them of colluding with Democrats to punish Dear Leader.
“This Department of Justice does not tolerate rogue judges — especially when they threaten the President’s core Article II powers,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said on social media.
“The district judges in NJ just proved this was never about law — it was about politics,” said Bondi deputy Todd Blanche.
This is dangerous nonsense. Bondi and Blanche know that federal law is on the judges’ side here, but they’re taking advantage of the public’s ignorance of the law to cast the judges as enemies of the state.

I worry about how this will end. The Trump administration claimed they removed Grace, whose sole crime is that the federal judges who oversee cases in New Jersey think she’s better qualified than Habba (considering Grace has worked in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for nearly a decade, that’s unquestionably true). But Grace told the New Jersey Globe she intends to take over as U.S. attorney on Saturday. I can’t imagine that will sit well with all the president’s men.
If what’s happening in New York is any indication, we’re stuck with Habba. Trump’s pick for U.S. attorney in New York’s northern district, John Sarcone, was not chosen to remain in the position by that district’s judges, so the president gave him a different title, and now Sarcone is still the district’s acting U.S. attorney.
Good news for Trump. Bad news for anyone interested in a government that works for anyone but him.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-1612469911.jpg,,,2025-07-24 07:00:46.800155

(Screenshot)A traditionally humdrum meeting detailing motor vehicle issues took a turn Wednesday when Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales spent nearly 15 minutes blasting critical press coverage, repeating the phrase “fake news” a dozen times during what’s typically a brief housekeeping segment.
During the Motor Vehicle Advisory Board meeting, Morales launched into a wide-ranging monologue defending his record, touting trade delegation meetings and visits to county fairs.
Morales challengers line up as criticism over international trips mounts

“Don’t pay attention to the fake news,” Morales said. “It is time for someone like me to share what we have done.”
He specifically called out WIBC and The Indianapolis Star, accusing the news outlets of misrepresenting his work and accomplishments.
“I’m not going to let the fake news, the fake IndyStar, the fake WIBC, to define me,” Morales said. “They are fake news, and they deserve to be called out.”
Since taking office in 2023, Morales has faced a stream of criticism tied to his international travel, office spending and hiring decisions. Media reports have scrutinized international trips and the use of campaign money to purchase a personal vehicle.
The Indiana Capital Chronicle has additionally reported on multimillion dollar no-bid contracts awarded by the office, as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars in spot bonuses approved by Morales. 
One of his office’s duties is to oversee the state’s auto dealers. The advisory board weighs in on the contents of forms; methods and procedures for evaluation of the qualifications of applicants for licenses; licensure actions and investigations into unfair practices.
In his remarks, the secretary of state denied using public dollars for international travel and said he personally footed the bill.
“No taxpayer money was used (for) all of this, because I don’t believe in that, unlike what the fake news says,” he said “I pay for it. I (put) my money where my mouth is.”

He also suggested that his engagement with foreign delegations was yielding tangible economic benefits, like car manufacturing jobs.
“When I went to downtown Chicago to the (Japanese) emperor’s birthday … they told me… ‘Indiana is our friend. We will be moving our Honda operations from Mexico to Indiana,’” he said.
“Yet the fake news said … ‘Diego Morales is at some guy’s birthday’ — when that ‘some guy’s birthday’ is moving their Honda operations here,” Morales continued.
He also praised President Donald Trump for implementing tariffs that influenced the move but took partial credit himself.
“I give him 99% because of his tariffs, but I take that 1%,” he said.
Morales also name-dropped visits to Germany — where he said he met with Volkswagen representatives — as well as trips to Taiwan and India.
Traditionally, economic trade and promotion of the state falls to other state agencies, such as the Indiana Economic Development Corporation or Governor’s Office.
More than trade
The secretary of state also touted voter registration drives at county fairs, boasted about his office’s outreach efforts at the Indiana State Fair and his own energy level.
“Tell me who other statewide office holder has crisscrossed all 92 counties within three months. No one,” Morales said. “My work ethic is unmatched. You know who’s the crazy guy who arrives in the statehouse between five and 5:30 a.m.?”

He referenced a new “AutoCheck” tool developed with Experian and said his office is prioritizing consumers by giving them free access to used car information. State taxpayers are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for the service. 
He also said that under his leadership, the office has increased enforcement activity.
“Before I came into office, we were getting more than 1,000 complaints just in one year,” Morales said. “And do you know how many enforcement actions they took? Twenty-one. That is unacceptable.”
Morales further spoke of his leadership, global experience and disdain for criticism.
“You can hate me if you want to. I don’t care. I don’t care. I’m here to get the job done,” he said, emphasizing that he didn’t seek the statewide office seat “to be a puppet.”
“You have never had a secretary of state like me who has a vision, who has studied all over the world, who has different skills and talents to benefit Indiana,” Morales added.
“Let’s look at Diego Morales — his abilities, his skills and talents that he has,” he said. “And you know what? I don’t care if you tell me this bragging. … There is no substitute against hard work. So you know what, I’m fired up and I’m excited, I’m excited to take on the world.”

The poll was conducted in the aftermath of a federal proposal from U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, to make millions of acres of public land in the U.S., including in Idaho, available to be sold off.
The poll specifically asked Idaho voters questions about Idaho public lands and who they support in Idaho’s 2026 U.S. Senate race.
Alexis Pickering, executive director of Conservation Voters for Idaho, said she has never in her career seen Idahoans from all sides of the political spectrum unite behind a single issue like they have behind public lands this year. 
“It really is clear that voters are unified in keeping public lands in public hands,” Pickering said in a phone interview Wednesday.
“It demonstrates that Idaho voters are very cognizant of this fight right now,” Pickering said. “They are very engaged, and they are not going to sit this out.”
More than 60% of the land in Idaho is public land of some form.
 Idaho’s registered voters are clear on their support for public access to public lands

The polling firm Change Research conducted the poll among 1,027 registered Idaho voters from July 15-17. The margin of error was 3.2%, according to Change Research.
One poll question asked voters, “Did you support or oppose the amendment to sell off over 3 million acres of public land across 11 Western states, including Idaho?” – with 87% of respondents saying they opposed it.
Battles over public lands loom even after sell-off proposal fails

Another poll question asked voters which statement came closest to their opinion:

Public lands in Idaho, where people enjoy outdoor activities such as fishing, hunting, hiking, camping, and biking, should remain public and be protected so that everyone can keep enjoying them.
Public lands in Idaho, where people enjoy outdoor activities such as fishing, hunting, hiking, camping, and biking, should be made available for purchase and private ownership.

Ninety-six percent of Idaho registered voters said public lands should remain public, including 97% of registered Democrats and 95% of registered Republicans, the poll found.
Lee withdrew his amendment to sell public lands after a public backlash and three of Idaho’s four members of Congress provided public opposition from within the Republican Party to selling public lands.
Even though the public lands amendment was withdrawn, Pickering said the issue isn’t going away. She said Conservation Voters for Idaho plans to highlight public lands as a central issue and continue to hold elected officials accountable for keeping public lands public.
Pickering also said the public is deeply invested in the issue and knows Lee could file another proposal to sell public lands. She compared the proposal to sell public lands to waking a sleeping bear.  
“Now that they have woken the bear, it will be really hard to get that bear back in hibernation mode,” Pickering said. 
 How Idaho’s congressional delegation responded to public lands proposal

Three of Idaho’s four members of Congress, U.S. Sens. Jim Risch and Mike Crapo and U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, all R-Idaho, provided public Republican opposition to the proposal to sell off public lands, the Sun previously reported.

On June 20, Risch and Crapo, both announced they were opposed to the provision in the budget reconciliation process to sell off public lands. Simpson co-sponsored the Public Lands in Public Hands Act. 
Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher, R-Idaho, opposed the Public Lands in Public Hands Act, the Utah News Dispatch reported.
In a phone interview with the Idaho Capital Sun earlier this month, Fulcher said, “public land should remain public, but the control, management should be local stakeholders, not the federal government.” 
Polling data shows that Risch received a 10% bump in support among all registered voters after they learned Risch provided opposition to the proposal to sell off public lands, up from 41% to 51%. Among registered Republican voters only, Risch’s support increased from 60% to 72% after voters learned Risch provided opposition to the proposal to sell off public lands.
The poll only asked voters about Risch’s upcoming U.S. Senate race, where he faces re-election in 2026. The poll did not ask about Crapo, Simpson or Fulcher, Pickering said.

Community colleges and corrections department offer robust Adult Education programs to bolster workforce. Losing funding would be “absolutely devastating,” state director says.
The post Wyoming adults use this program to gain high school diplomas and work training. Its funding is in limbo. appeared first on WyoFile .","They are single moms seeking diplomas to better support their families. Homeschooled teenagers who realize they have significant learning gaps in math. Inmates who want to enter career training programs after prison. 
Adults, for one reason or another, who want a second chance at education. 
And each year, hundreds of these non-traditional Wyoming students pass high-school-equivalency exams, gain certifications in fields like phlebotomy, improve English language skills or get on a college track through what’s known as “Adult Education.” The federally funded program with the nondescript name is offered through all of Wyoming’s community colleges, as well as Wyoming’s Department of Corrections and Uinta County BOCES. 
It’s free for participants. And it’s proven successful in bolstering the state’s workforce, said Adult Education State Director Diane McQueen. 
So, news this month that federal funding is being withheld as the 60-year-old program goes under review ignited dread about the future of what supporters see as an indisputably benefitial program. It boosts literacy, increases education levels and creates a population better equipped for modern jobs, said Tonya Hacker, dean of outreach and workforce development at Laramie County Community College. 
“A lot of people can’t get jobs or they can’t enroll in even technical training programs without high school equivalency,” Hacker said. “It is a huge factor in socioeconomic mobility, and so important for supporting that population of people within the state — and it’s a large population of people — who aren’t able to complete high school the traditional way.”
The program’s value is self-evident, said Casper College Public Relations Director Chris Lorenzen. 
“You’ve got kids dropping out of high school, you’ve got the adult education program getting them to high school equivalency, and you’ve got them then going on into the workforce, or even post-secondary,” he said. “That’s a path that we would all think is really valuable to our economies, to our society.”

From Cheyenne to Casper, Riverton to Powell, Wyoming’s Adult Education providers are anxiously waiting to learn the fate of the program’s funding. Some are already curtailing offerings. It’s not hyperbole to say the future of many residents — including some of the state’s most vulnerable — is on the line, they say. 
“What’s happening with Adult Education is absolutely devastating,” McQueen said. “To tear Adult Ed out of this integrated system is going to … hurt the economy, hurt students, programs, everything.”
Little fanfare, big impact
Each Adult Education center in Wyoming offers a singular mix of courses based on service-area needs. They range from evening English as a Second Language classes to instruction on building résumés and classes to prepare students for high-school-equivalency exams, like the HiSET and GED. Some community colleges operate programs in rural outposts; others offer tutoring hours on campus.
To enroll, a person must be at least 16 and not in K-12 school, lack a diploma and function below the 12th-grade level in at least one basic academic area. 
Much of the programming is funded through Title II of the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. That program provides states with money for a variety of services aimed at bolstering and supporting workforce development. It is designed to work in tandem with other workforce initiatives. In Wyoming, the Department of Workforce Services is a partner.

Adult Education’s benefits are manifold, center directors say. 
“It is a vital service,” said Sandy Myers, the adult basic education manager at Northwest College. It’s estimated that the $520 per student in federal dollars brings a return on investment of more than $6,000 in tax revenue and reduced service costs, she said. 
More than 1,700 Wyoming students enrolled in Adult Education during fiscal year 2024/25, according to state records. Enrollment is tallied by students who completed 12 or more hours or had a valid assessment. 
More than 70% of students achieved what’s known as “measurable skill gains,” according to state data. That occurs when a student, for example, gains entry into postsecondary education or completes a high school equivalency certificate.
Enrollment in what’s known as the integrated education and training program has grown by nearly 90% in three years, McQueen said. Another major component of Adult Education is the high-school-equivalency program.

“We are the largest high school in Wyoming,” McQueen said. “We graduated 550 students last year.” 
Wyoming relies on federal funds to cover more than half of the program costs.
Uncertainty and fear 
In early June, states received notification that federal Adult Education funds would be available July 1, McQueen said. Then, just 12 hours before that funding was supposed to kick in, “we got a notice that the federal funds are being withheld and are under review.” 
Wyoming expected roughly $1 million, she said. 
The news has created confusion across the state as directors scramble to figure out what they can provide — and if the program will continue. 
Existential doubt had begun even earlier. When the federal discretionary budget proposal was released in May, Hacker of LCCC said, Adult Education was one of the areas to be cut. That, along with broader discussions about dissolving the U.S. Department of Education, cast doubt on its long-term viability. 
Ten days after the funds were withheld, on July 10, the U.S. Department of Education released an “interpretive rule” relating to career, technical and adult educational programs. That rule rescinded a Clinton-era provision related to citizenship status and underscored that federal funds cannot be used in services that benefit undocumented residents. 
“Postsecondary education programs funded by the federal government should benefit American citizens, not illegal aliens,” U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in the announcement. “Under President Trump’s leadership, hardworking American taxpayers will no longer foot the bill for illegal aliens to participate in our career, technical, or adult education programs or activities.”

The notice “reminds grantees and subgrantees of their obligations to verify the eligibility of participants to ensure that limited federal funding is not being improperly distributed to noneligible individuals or used to support programs and services that serve illegal aliens,” the announcement read. 
This new language may likely result in additional red tape, said Casper College Director of Adult Education and Lifelong Learning Kat Bohr-Buresh. But much is still unknown and funding is still in limbo. “It’s been just months of uncertainty,” she said.
Redemption and second chances
Adult Education directors and instructors have countless stories of lives turned around through the program. 
Hacker with LCCC told of a family that moved to Wyoming from the Middle East. They sought asylum and received citizenship. “The husband was fluent in English, but the wife was not at all.”
So she enrolled in Adult Education, starting with English classes. Then she transitioned to the high school equivalency side.
“She received that credential, and then she went on to get a medical assistant certificate,” Hacker said. “Now she’s going to work right here in our community as a medical assistant, with the long-term goal of becoming a nurse.” 
Bohr-Buresh recalled a formerly incarcerated student who began when he was in the re-entry system. He completed his HiSET as he recovered from addiction and went on to become a featured student speaker at commencement. “He now has a job, and he’s enrolled at Casper College,” she said.

McQueen remembers a student at Eastern Wyoming College who was blind. The Division of Vocational Rehabilitation at Workforce Services procured a service dog for her. “After she got a seeing-eye dog, she went on to Casper College and she graduated,” McQueen said. “These are the kind of success stories we see in Adult Ed.”
All kinds of life factors can disrupt an education, Jennifer Marshall Weydeveld, spokesperson at Central Wyoming College, noted. Among them: Medical issues, death in the family, pregnancy, lack of self-esteem. The result is a population of adults who lack the skills or credentials to qualify for many jobs, pursue postsecondary education or find work with health benefits.
“Estimates are that 54% of adults in the U.S. read at or below a 6th grade level, 1 in 5 adults reads at a Kindergarten to 1st grade level,” Marshall Weydeveld wrote in an email. “On average our students enter the program with a reading level around 4th-5th grade.”
Students come into the program for a similarly wide range of reasons, directors say. There are homeschooled teenagers with gaps in reading comprehension. Widows who became unexpected sole breadwinners. Parents inspired by their own adult children to enter college.
“Many of our students can be described as square pegs that never fit into the round holes of public education,” Bohr-Buresh said, echoing an instructor’s observation. 
Impacts now and future
Funding impacts are already curtailing Wyoming’s programs.
Central Wyoming College’s Adult Education Center cancelled its summer enrollment class, an introductory course that is the first step in completing a high-school-equivalency exam. Some 34 students were registered, Marshall Weydeveld told WyoFile. 
Despite the cancellation, CWC’s program is in relatively good shape this year due to already distributed funding from other federal grants, Marshall Weydeveld wrote. “However, FY ’25-26 is the final year of funding for those grants. This leaves us in desperate need to find alternative funding as we look to the survival of the programs in the future.”
When uncertainty started to percolate, Casper College tightened its belt, Bohr-Buresh said. In the alternative budget it drafted to reflect federal cuts, it axed professional development, shifted around funding pools and eliminated non-essentials.

Those non-essentials, however, can make an enormous difference in Adult Education, she said. Of the roughly 300 students served in the recent school year in Casper, 18 were classified as runaway youth, homeless or foster care participants. Some 131 self-identified as having disabilities; 186 were low-income; 77 were ex-offenders and 64 were single parents. 
“The students that we serve are people who have incredible barriers and obstacles in life, and sometimes something as simple as providing lunch” — a non-essential — can be the deciding factor for participation, she said. 
If the school has to implement new regulations to certify citizenship, she added, that could pile on more barriers, such as asking students who are homeless to provide a certified birth certificate.
At LCCC, the college has leftover American Recovery Plan Act funding it can use to supplement its Adult Education, Hacker said. That money will “kind of limp us through this year,” she said. “We are OK this year, but some of the other community colleges are not OK if they don’t receive this federal funding.”

At Northwest College in Powell, the Adult Education service area includes Big Horn, Park and Washakie counties — a huge area. The program currently operates classrooms in Basin, Cody, Greybull, Lovell, Powell and Worland. 
“Cuts would likely mean a closure of either the Basin or Greybull classroom,” Myers of Northwest said. In addition, “it will affect the number of instructional hours that we are able to offer at each site. It already has.”
Myers doesn’t want funding threats to discourage potential students, however. “As long as we are open, we will serve anybody who needs help,” she said. “That will be non-negotiable.”

It's a fallacy that universities use federal research grants to fatten their bank accounts, writes UW Professor David Fay.
The post Cutting federal funding for academic research will hurt Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","I started as an assistant professor of molecular biology at the University of Wyoming in 2001. Within a few years, I was running a bustling lab with support from both the American Cancer Society and the National Institutes of Health, the latter of which has continued to fund my research for my entire career at UW. I’ve been participating in a decades-old collaboration between the federal government and U.S. universities that has made our nation, its universities, and its biotech and pharmaceutical industries the envy of the world.

Opinion

My role in this collaboration has been to teach students to think critically and become productive, rigorous scientists. Their discoveries and papers contribute to our collective knowledge and propel these students into careers in medicine, teaching and research.
But I worry now that this successful model of education and scientific discovery may be coming to an end, along with the preeminence of the U.S. as the world leader in biomedical innovation and technology. There are several reasons for concern, but they all come down to fundamental misconceptions about how the federal government funds academic research.
One major fallacy is that universities use federal research grants to fatten their bank accounts. The reality is that most universities, including UW, barely break even on federal grants and more often lose money. This is because the allowable overhead dollars — also referred to as “indirect costs” — paid by the federal government don’t fully cover the costs of the research, just like the price of the ingredients alone doesn’t cover the true cost of a meal at a restaurant. As a comparison, when private companies are contracted to do federal research, they may receive more than two times the amount of overhead given to universities doing equivalent work. Viewed this way, federally sponsored university research may be considered a bargain. In fact, standard estimates indicate that every dollar invested in the NIH pays out $2.56 in returns to our economy.
Still, some in government are proposing to cut the overhead on federal grants to less than a third of what is currently received by most universities, including UW. If that happens, universities will no longer be able to support research on their campuses, and the entire research enterprise and innovation engine will stall. And because universities are where workforce
training in the STEM fields occurs, our reliable supply of qualified workers will rapidly shrink, and impacted industries will move their base of operations elsewhere. We would be relegating our profitable status as the leader in science and innovation to the rest of the world.
The situation gets even worse when looking at the proposed 2026 federal budget, which includes roughly 40% cuts to the NIH and 56% cuts to the National Science Foundation. The impact of such reductions cannot be overstated. They would collapse the vital network sustaining U.S. science and technology, end training and economic opportunities for many of our
young people, and push a major economic and strategic sector out of the U.S. and into the hands of our fiercest global competitors.
And the amount saved? Well, the NIH budget last year accounted for only 0.71% of the $6.78 trillion spent by the federal government. So, while fiscal responsibility is important, it shouldn’t come at the cost of slashing investments that clearly pay off. Just as federal funding for interstates is essential for commerce, federal funding for the sciences is necessary for technology, innovation, health care and economic growth.
Cuts to federal funding for research will have a strong impact on the state of Wyoming, well beyond the flagship university in Laramie. In addition to running my lab, I also help to oversee a separate NIH program grant, which
funds research, training and infrastructure at UW and our state’s community colleges. I’ve had the privilege of visiting these colleges, working with their faculty and meeting many of these students over the past 10 years. Since 2015, that program has provided roughly $40.2 million in support to Wyoming, of which approximately 30% has been distributed to community colleges for faculty and student training, collaborative research  opportunities and infrastructure development. Our program helps to ensure that young people from rural areas across Wyoming have access to high-quality professional training opportunities to advance their careers.
Simply put, there is never a good time to pull out of an investment that continually pays such strong dividends and directly benefits the citizens of our state.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Across the nation, Medicaid is the single largest payer for mental health care, and in rural America, residents disproportionately rely on the public insurance program.
But Medicaid cuts in the massive tax and spending bill signed into law earlier this month will worsen mental health disparities in those communities, experts say, as patients lose coverage and rural health centers are unable to remain open amid a loss of funds.
“The context to begin with is, even with no Medicaid cuts, the access to mental health services in rural communities is spotty at best, just very spotty at best — and in many communities, there’s literally no care,” said Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors.
Cuts over the next 10 years could force low-income rural families to pay for mental health care out of pocket on top of driving farther for care, experts say. Many will simply forgo care for depression, bipolar disorder and other illnesses that need consistent treatment.
No one knows whether Trump’s $50B for rural health will be enough

“Not only do you have very few services available, but you don’t have the resources to pay for the services,” Manderscheid said. “That makes the problem even worse.”
Rural communities are already at higher risk of suicide, with rates almost doubling over the past two decades. Already, rural communities are grappling with a shortage in mental health professionals, making them more vulnerable to losses compared with more urban areas, experts say.
Paul Mackie, assistant director of the Center for Rural Behavioral Health at Minnesota State University, Mankato, studies rural mental health workforce shortages.
“If it [coverage] goes away, what would then be the person’s next option if they already don’t have the resources?” said Mackie, who grew up on a rural Michigan dairy farm. “You can have a rural psychologist or a rural clinical social worker working under a shingle, literally alone.”
Small rural hospitals often provide critical behavioral health care access, he said. One analysis found the cuts next year would leave 380 rural hospitals at risk of shutting down.
 How changes to Medicaid eligibility, expansion will affect states

States such as Mackie’s Minnesota, which expanded Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, would suffer significant slashes in federal matches as a result of President Donald Trump’s signature legislation. The law, which includes tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy, cuts the federal government’s 90% matching rate for enrollees covered under expansion to anywhere from 50% to 74%.
States will have to redetermine eligibility twice a year on millions enrolled under Medicaid expansion. Some Medicaid recipients also will have to prove work history. The new law creates work requirement exceptions for those with severe medical conditions — including mental disorders and substance use — but experts say proving those conditions may be convoluted. The exact qualifications and diagnoses for the exceptions haven’t been spelled out, according to a report by KFF, a health policy research organization.












Not only do you have very few services available, but you don't have the resources to pay for the services. That makes the problem even worse.


– Ron Manderscheid, former executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors




“You can’t work when your mental illness is not treated,” said Dr. Heidi Alvey, an emergency and critical care medicine physician in Indiana. “It’s so counter to the reality of the situation.”
Alvey worked seven years at Baylor Scott & White Health’s hospital in Temple, Texas. As nearby rural critical access hospitals and other mental health centers shut down, the hospital became the only access point for people hours away, she said.
“People who just had absolutely no access to care were coming hours in to see us,” she said. Many had serious untreated mental health conditions, she said, and had to wait days or weeks in the emergency department until a care facility had an open bed.
She’s concerned that Medicaid cuts will only make those problems worse.
 Medicaid cuts and rural health care

Jamie Freeny, director of the Center for School Behavioral Health at advocacy group Mental Health America of Greater Houston, worries for the rural families her center serves. The organization works with school districts across the state, including those in rural communities. Nearly 40% of the state’s more than 1,200 school districts are classified as rural.
She remembers one child whose family had to drive to another county for behavioral health. The family lost coverage during the Medicaid unwinding, as pandemic provisions for automatic re-reenrollment expired. The child stopped taking mental health medication and ended up dropping out of school.
“The child wasn’t getting the medicine that they needed, because their family couldn’t afford it,” Freeny said. “The catalyst for that was a lack of Medicaid. That’s just one family.
“Now, you’re multiplying that.”
How Congress’s megabill will impact Idaho: Cuts to taxes, Medicaid, SNAP and more

Family medicine physician Dr. Ian Bennett sees Medicaid patients at the Vallejo Family Health Services Center of Solano County in California’s Bay Area. The community health clinic serves patients from across the area’s rural farm communities and combines primary care with mental health care services, Bennett said.
“When our patients lose Medicaid, which we expect that they will, then we’ll have to continue to take them, and that will be quite a strain on the finances of that system,” Bennett said. The center could even close, he said.
“The folks who are having the most difficulty managing their lives — and that’s made worse by having depression or substance use disorder — are going to be the folks most likely to drop off,” said Bennett, a University of Washington mental health services researcher. “The impacts down the road are clearly going to be much worse for society as we have less people able to function.”
The psychiatric care landscape across Michigan’s rural western lower peninsula is already scarce, said Joseph “Chip” Johnston. He’s the executive director of the Centra Wellness Network, a publicly funded community mental health care provider for Manistee and Benzie counties. The network serves Medicaid and uninsured patients from high-poverty communities.
“I used to have psychiatric units close by as an adjunct to my service,” he said. “And they’ve all closed. So, now the closest [psychiatric bed] for a child, for example, is at least two hours away.”
Those facilities are also expensive. A one-night stay in an inpatient psychiatric facility can be anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 a night, he said.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)The board controlling the West Tennessee Megasite — home to Ford’s BlueOval City electric vehicle and battery manufacturing campus — unanimously approved zoning rules Wednesday that require greater protections for the Memphis Sand Aquifer, the region’s drinking water source.
The 4,100-acre megasite sits atop the aquifer, which is protected from surface-level contaminants by a layer of natural clay. But breaches in the clay can allow contaminants to reach the water that serves much of the Mid-South.
The federal government requires states to identify areas where contaminants can reach drinking water sources and develop plans to protect public water supply around well locations, but the zoning ordinance adopted Wednesday goes beyond those protections, extending some regulations throughout the entire megasite.
The zoning regulations are embraced by Protect Our Aquifer, a Memphis-based nonprofit dedicated to protecting water quality in the Memphis Sand Aquifer that has been pushing for their passage for years.
“There are residents that do surround BlueOval City that rely on these private wells for drinking water, and they deserve this reassurance that their health is really being thought about in the process of building out this big facility,” Protect Our Aquifer Executive Director Sarah Houston said. “This ordinance helps protect them, protect and reduce future financial liability for the state of Tennessee, the megasite and even Ford and other tenants.”
The ordinance now requires any special-use permit application within the state-owned megasite’s boundaries to provide evidence that the proposed land use will not negatively impact the aquifer’s water quality. Any plans for site approval must also provide information about any hazardous materials that could be used on the site and demonstrate that these uses will not impact the aquifer. 
Additionally, typical regulations would impose stricter protections to prevent contaminants from entering wells within a 250-foot radius of a well site for an industrial water system, and lesser standards within a 750-foot radius. The new ordinance applies the most stringent protections within the entire 750-foot radius.
The University of Memphis’ Center for Applied Earth Science and Engineering Research (CAESAR), Ford and other stakeholders determined stricter regulations made sense, Chris Bowles, outside counsel for the board, said during Wednesday’s meeting.
“Once fully operational, there will be a tremendous amount of water being drawn from these wells,” Bowles said. “You can imagine contaminants flowing very quickly from the edges of that wellhead protection area, out the well and into the system serving this industrial park, so there was a desire based on that volume to provide that greater level of protection.”
Some questions remain. Houston wants to know how megasite-wide requirements for hazardous material disclosures and mitigation plans will be monitored and enforced. She also asked if a specialized engineer will review mitigation plans presented with permit applications.
Chris Richards, a member of the Megasite Authority board, suggested adding an annual review of this zoning ordinance to the board’s regular calendar so the board “can feel comfortable that the intent of the document, which is extraordinarily comprehensive, is being met.”
Houston said the regulations are not about “punishing” businesses or “trying to stall development,” but rather about risk management and avoidance of long-term costs on a site where there will inevitably be spills and leaks. She alluded to multi-million-dollar cleanups that resulted from past “poor practices” in Shelby County.
“We support this great step, and we think it sets a really positive precedent for sustainable development, and it sends a really clear message that protecting the Memphis Sand Aquifer is not optional,” Houston said. “It’s a shared responsibility, and we can all have a role in what this looks like. These are real, practical, basic solutions.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_2872-1024x674.jpg,,,2025-07-24 06:08:12.043064

Tony Evers and state legislators cut taxes by $1.3 billion in the new state budget, paying out a quarter of the state’s $4.6 billion surplus so that Wisconsinites who earn up to $200,000 can get a tax break worth an average of $180 per year.
That’s not a lot of money to trade for losing access to child care, reducing services that help veterans find jobs and housing, and cutting programs at schools. But somehow cutting taxes has become an agreed-upon, bipartisan top priority, even as the defunding of everything begins to take a major toll on our quality of life.
As Baylor Spears reports, more than 65% of Wisconsin school districts will face a reduction in funds under the new state budget. Many will go to local property taxpayers to ask for more – to the annoyance of citizens who are getting tired of the constant begging from schools that no longer receive adequate funding from the state. Local residents were willing to say yes to a record number of school funding referenda in 2024. But there are signs their patience is wearing thin.
Republican legislators are tapping into that annoyance with a bill to repeal the results of Evers’ partial veto of the last budget, which extended a temporary increase in the cap on revenue school districts could raise for the next 400 years. Evers’ maneuver outraged Republicans, who challenged the veto before the Wisconsin Supreme Court and lost. The new bill would undo the veto’s effect on school revenue caps (and the bill itself will also, presumably, be vetoed by Evers).
“The pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock 402 years before this veto,” the Republican sponsors of the bill write. “It is hard to justify locking in a funding increase for just as long into the future.” 
But like the 180 bucks a year in “tax relief” Republican legislators are touting as a major victory for middle class Wisconsinites, Evers’ 400 year veto amounts to less than meets the eye. For one thing, it doesn’t lock in an increase — it just allows districts to raise an additional $325 per pupil through a combination of local property taxes and state aid. Individual school boards must still vote to pass any property tax increase. And the state could head off those property tax increases by putting more money into schools. Instead, Republican legislators insisted on no increase at all in general school aid in the budget. The same legislative Republicans who are howling about property tax increases created the problem, refusing to fund education and then blaming districts that turn to the only other source of funding they can tap.
Overall, the Wisconsin Policy Forum reports, Wisconsin has slipped from one of the top states for education spending into the bottom half over the last 25 years. Tax-cutting replaced education as the state’s top priority. While most other states increased spending on education after the pandemic, in Wisconsin spending on schools went down. And we spend far less as a share of personal income on education now than we did in the early 2000s, and less than the national average.
Behind all of this budget math is the sad reality that, if we don’t agree to shoulder some expenses as a society, a lot of the elements of a decent life are out of reach for most people. Not paying for things through taxes doesn’t make expenses go away. It just makes them more burdensome on the smaller group that has to pay. It takes a bigger bite out of local property tax payers to pick up the cost of their schools than if the cost is spread across the state in the form of income taxes, and it’s even more expensive for individual families to pay the full cost of educating their kids. In the early 2000s, Wisconsin had the best school system in the Midwest at a cost of about 5% of personal income for taxpayers, according to the Wisconsin Policy Forum. That’s about $2,500 of a $50,000 income. Try to find full-time private education for less than that. 
Not just schools but a clean environment, public safety, good roads and reliable services and infrastructure that doesn’t fail are things we’ve long taken for granted. Those things are all threatened now. 
When I was a high school exchange student in Quito, Ecuador, I learned that running water in the affluent suburb where I lived was not guaranteed. Sometimes the water would go out when you were taking a shower. Keeping a bucket of water in the bathroom just in case was normal. Then a well known government official moved into the neighborhood and the problem, temporarily, cleared up. 
We are moving toward that sort of social setup now in the U.S. 
The assumption that drives tax-cutting mania at the state and national level is that we shouldn’t have to spend money toward collective, public goods. We should all pay our own way. That’s fine if you can hire your own private security firm, send your kids to private academies, and avoid contact with an increasingly desperate populace. For most people, it’s a terrible bargain.
It’s both cheaper and better for all of us, as individuals, to support a decent society for all. It only becomes unaffordable when we start pulling apart the fabric of society, convincing people they’ll be better off going it alone, after liquidating our collective wealth.
Undermining confidence in public institutions and cutting taxes so those institutions are underfunded and strained are part of the same push to increase the wealth of the already wealthy, and help them shirk any responsibility to contribute to society
Why should poor people have health care? Why should the elderly and disabled be protected from being thrown out on the street? Why should little kids have nutritious meals? If you weren’t clever enough to be born rich, you deserve nothing. That’s not exactly how the Trump administration puts it, or the Republicans in the state Legislature who have been insisting for years on frittering away the state’s budget surplus on tax cuts worth very little to anyone who doesn’t already make a ton of money. But it’s the basic, underlying idea.
This argument is compelling only to people who don’t understand the math.
Elon Musk, whose $400 billion fortune is more than the wealth owned by one-half of all U.S. citizens combined, doesn’t want to pay what for him is a pittance to help maintain the health and wellbeing of our country.
Wisconsin Republicans were unwilling to spend $4 million — .004% of the total state budget — to maintain veterans’ services to keep military vets from becoming homeless.
Efficiency, cost savings — these are the alleged goals of the federal and state austerity programs. But the real goal is to make you forget what it was like to live in a functional society, one where kids had enough to eat and people didn’t die of preventable diseases, the environment was clean and Wisconsin children could get a great, free education, afford to go to college and dream of owning a home.
What the anti-government tax-cutters want is a society riven by resentment and anger, where people are divided against each other and the dysfunction makes it easy to “divide and conquer” as our last Republican governor memorably put it.
Down with education, down with clean water, down with health care and nutrition for poor kids. Up with lurid crime stories and hateful, divisive rhetoric.
When society falls apart, it’s much easier for greedy charlatans to plunder and steal the wealth of the state. And after we’ve codified irresponsibility — spent down the treasury and starved society and made permanent the arrangement whereby the richest people in society are not obligated to contribute, well then it becomes much harder to make the rich pay their fair share.
Try to remember what it was like to have a decent, functional Wisconsin. Try not to give in to the politics of distraction and division. For $180 is a pathetic bribe to give up stability, security and the opportunity for the kids of today to grow up with hope that they can still have a decent life.

Brad Little had “received the complete and total endorsement of President Donald Trump in June.” 
We have had good reason to believe that the governor was headed toward full-on MAGA. After all, his support for substantial cuts to Medicaid this session and his belief that parents who send their kids to private and religious schools should get a tax credit of $5,000 per kid, is right in line with the MAGA playbook. Little’s letter begged for campaign funds so that he can implement MAGA policy in Idaho for four more years.
Trump tax law runs up deficit by $3.4T, throws 10 million off health insurance, CBO says

Little strongly supported Trump’s Big Beautiful Billionaire Bill (BBBB), which will explode the national debt to an unsustainable $40 trillion and result in the largest ever transfer of wealth from poor to rich Americans. The Idaho Fiscal Policy Center estimates that top income earners will get an average of $78,000, while the lowest earners will get only $20. 
Over the next decade the bill will cut $4.3 billion in federal funding for Idaho Medicaid and reduce enrollment in the state by up to 40,000 people. Heaven help our local hospitals. SNAP and other safety net programs will also sustain massive cuts. 
U.S. Sens. Jim Risch and Mike Crapo, both R-Idaho, have already signed onto the full Trump program and both voted for the BBBB. In fact, Crapo was the chief architect of the Senate bill, making deeper cuts to Medicaid than the House version and increasing the amount of national debt we are bestowing upon future generations. 
In recognition of Crapo’s major role, Trump’s office distributed a lovely picture of Crapo looking quite pleased at the BBBB signing ceremony. Let’s pray that modest-income Idahoans don’t get sick. 
The BBBB drafters were clever to disguise the damage their handiwork will do to working people. The tax benefits for the wealthy will kick in right away, but the massive cuts in safety net spending for the masses will only kick in after the midterm elections next year. To top off their allegiance to Trump’s command, both Risch and Crapo voted last week to cut $1 billion for public radio and public television. The Trump regime has no use for cultural programming or balanced reporting.
Little, Risch and Crapo seem to think that obedience to Trump is a ticket to keeping their precious offices. Reading the tea leaves, including the most recent polling, it is a good bet that they are woefully wrong. By the time the general election rolls around next year, I expect that Americans, including a majority of Idahoans, will have had enough. It is likely that Idaho’s MAGA sycophants will lose out to candidates who are willing to honorably and courageously serve their state and nation.
Take Trump’s premier issue – immigration. Voters responded to Trump’s call to remove violent criminals from the country, but they are now recoiling at his rounding up and mistreatment of law-abiding, tax-paying laborers who are milking cows, tending crops, cleaning hotel rooms and performing a range of other services that citizens refuse to do. 
And, as they say, we ain’t seen nothin’ yet. With the BBBB’s $170.7 billion in funding for immigration and border enforcement, the unsavory conduct of ICE agents will only get worse. The 10,000 new agents hired with that money will be Trump loyalists, whose activities will very likely expand beyond the immigration arena to intimidation and coercion of American citizens. That won’t go over well.
Trump has done little to address the cost of living, the other main issue that put him in office. He has taken no meaningful action since his inauguration to lessen the cost of living. In fact, prices of food and other essentials have continued to rise. 
The chaotic actions taken by Trump on tariffs will result in even greater price increases across the board. Let’s take two examples – tomatoes and coffee. Trump has announced a 17% tariff on fresh tomatoes from Mexico where we get about 70% of our supply. The purported purpose is to protect U.S. growers, but Trump did not say where we are going to get the workers to grow and harvest the crop.
Trump threatened to slap a 50% tariff on all imports from Brazil unless prosecution proceedings are halted against his bosom buddy, Jair Bolsonaro, for trying to stage a coup against Brazil’s duly-elected president. That makes our president look like a lawless despot. And it would certainly cause the price of a cup of coffee to skyrocket.
Suffice it to say that when the midterm elections are upon us, Little and Risch will likely be scrambling to distance themselves from Trump’s governmental malpractice. It is doubtful they will keep their seats. Crapo won’t have to answer until 2028.

Two versions of the same measure were filed with Legislative Council Staff last week by retired contractor Donald Hanneman from Castle Rock and retired tech executive Michael A. Hancock from Aurora. One includes a 10-year sunset. The initial review and comment meeting is set for Aug. 1.
“We need to redirect existing fees back to roads, which is the cornerstone of our economic development,” Weld County Commissioner Kevin Ross said in a statement in support of the initiative.

Roads and other transportation infrastructure is funded through a combination of federal, state and local government revenue in Colorado. A lot of that state transportation funding comes from the gas tax and vehicle registration fees — money that is already constitutionally required to go into the Highway Users Tax Fund and toward the construction and maintenance of public highways.
For the current fiscal year, there is projected to be about $1.3 billion in the HUTF to distribute to various entities. About half of that will go to the transportation department and smaller shares are slated for counties and municipalities.
The proposed ballot measure would require that all sales taxes, tolls and fees imposed on cars and gas, retail delivery fees and ride-share fees go towards roads and bridges, ultimately pulling money from the state’s recent efforts to encourage different modes of travel and mitigate environmental impacts from car use.










Now is the time for states like Colorado to protect the policies we have and, if anything, compensate for the lack of federal support for things like electric vehicles and public transit.


– Matt Frommer, transportation and land use policy manager at the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project


Since landmark 2021 transportation legislation, a handful of fees and enterprise funds have partially funded projects like electrifying vehicle fleets, encouraging multimodal transit and installing electric vehicle charging stations.
Colorado’s prearranged ride fee, for example, is either 18 cents or 34 cents, depending on vehicle type, and is imposed on rides from companies like Uber and Lyft. It funds transit expansions, electric vehicle adoption strategies and air pollution mitigation.
The 28-cent retail delivery fee is allocated to multimodal transportation options, state highways and electrification efforts. It raised close to $93 million in 2024. A little less than 30% of that fee revenue goes to the Multimodal Transportation and Mitigation Options Fund, and the rest goes to HUTF.
But measure backers say that about $200 million in transportation fees, such as the prearranged ride fee and delivery fee, are being directed away from road maintenance to funnel money towards mass transit projects in the Denver metro area. They want that to go to fixing the roads Colorado drivers use.
The budget passed during the most recent legislative session cut nearly $114 million in transportation funding to help fill a $1.2 billion budget hole. A coalition of elected officials and business groups urged lawmakers not to make those cuts, and some of them are now backing the potential ballot measure.
“The lack of transportation funding has reached a point of critical concern. In order for Colorado to stay competitive, we need funding for roads and bridges infrastructure that meets the needs of our industries that operate statewide,” Loren Furman, president and CEO of the Colorado Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement. “Sustainable solutions are critical for ensuring that Colorado is a place that attracts businesses and workers.”
The measure would also require that federal funds meant for car use and two-thirds of sales tax collected on car parts and accessories go toward road maintenance.
Matt Frommer, the transportation and land use policy manager at the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project said the initiative would be a move in the wrong direction, especially as the federal government rolls back policies like electric vehicle incentives.
“Now is the time for states like Colorado to protect the policies we have and, if anything, compensate for the lack of federal support for things like electric vehicles and public transit,” he said. “There’s a real risk here of abandoning these efforts at all levels of government right at a time when they’re starting to pick up and gain some traction.”
He said the impact of such an initiative could be fewer transit options, increased car dependence and more traffic congestion on the state’s roads.
The measure’s proponents have a long road to landing the issue on the ballot, including getting a title set by the state Title Board, getting approved for a petition and gathering enough signatures. As a constitutional amendment, it would need 55% of the vote to pass.

(Abadonian iStock | Getty Images Plus )Earlier this week, West Virginia Watch reported its analysis of how local governments across the state spent their first allotment of opioid settlement funds, with a majority of those funds going toward law enforcement purposes.
Now, we’re breaking down that spending even more and — through graphics and interactive, searchable tables — allowing you to see all reported expenditures for yourself. Each category will have its own table and, at the end of the article, a large table will have details on all 173 expenditures made across the state.
Almost all of the information in these visualizations and in our analysis came from a local spending report published last week by the West Virginia First Foundation. Some information has been added through interviewing local officials on the spending. 
The report covers spending of opioid spending dollars by local governments between July 1, 2023 and June 30, 2024. The allocations to local governments are separate from money being disbursed by the First Foundation, which is the private nonprofit created in 2023 to dole out the state’s share of opioid settlement dollars. 
The First Foundation has no authority or control over how localities spend their share of the funds.
In total, $72.8 million in opioid settlement funds were disbursed to 226 local governments across the state in fiscal year 2024. Of those local governments, 144 disclosed not spending any money. Sixteen other local governments did not return their spending reports to the First Foundation and are not included in this analysis.
About 9.4% — more than $6.9 million — of the total $72.8 million received in FY2024 was reported as being spent.
The breakdown of all spending was:

$3.64 million to law enforcement
$685,000 to quick response teams
$643,000 on EMS
$519,000 on jail bills
$444,200 on rehab, recovery and treatment
$413,400 on youth services
$354,000 on government transfers
$205,000 on various other uses

Law enforcement spending
Security enhancements, cruisers, salaries and restitution payments made up a bulk of law enforcement spending, which totaled $3.64 million — more than five times what was spent in any other category.
The largest single expenditures for law enforcement were:

$352,000 from Princeton’s opioid settlement dollars to its general fund to serve as “restitution” for previous law enforcement costs
$333,000 from Wetzel County for new police and first responder radios
$293,000 from South Charleston for police payroll
$250,000 from Mason County for six new vehicles for the sheriff’s office
$241,000 from Summersville for “internal drug task force initiatives”

Use this table to search through all law enforcement expenditures across the state:
Quick Response Teams and EMS
Though it was the second highest category of spending totaling $685,000, there were only four single expenditures for quick response teams in the state. That spending accounted for about 10% of all local opioid spending across West Virginia.
The expenditures were:

$25,000 from Boone County for the county QRT to transport clients
$35,000 from Jackson County to the county QRT
$125,000 from Cabell County to the county QRT
$500,000 from Charleston to the city Coordinated Addiction Response Effort team for two QRT positions that were previously covered by a grant that lapsed in 2023 and a mental health coordinator

Though a bit less was spent on EMS, the uses of the funds were more varied. Overall, localities spent about $643,000 on first responders, accounting for more than 9% of all spending.
Some spending — about $275,000 — was for general EMS support. Statewide, EMS workers are consistently underfunded and understaffed. Many use outdated vehicles and equipment and pay, generally, remains low as the state has failed to fund permanent funding sources for the critical services.
The largest single expenditures for EMS were:

$95,700 from Wheeling for medical equipment
$90,600 from St. Albans to purchase two vehicles for the fire department
$43,400 from Cabell County for new radios
$35,000 from Pleasants County for two chest compression devices
$26,000 from Hardy County to purchase gym memberships and workout machines for first responders

Use this table to search through all first responder expenditures across the state:
Jail bills
Three county governments used portions of their funds to pay for jail bills. One — Clay County — used its entire first allotment of funds for the bill.
Each county pays its jail bill at the same rate, but the totals differ depending on how many people from a county are being held at a regional jail. Until 2023, a cap was in place that limited the amount each county would be charged per an inmate at $48.25 per a day.
Without the cap, the cost for each person held in a regional jail is $54.48 per a day. Many counties report that jail bills are their highest annual expenses each year.
The expenditures for jail bills were:

$229,550 by Clay County 
$115,500 by Grant County 
$174,000 by Upshur County

Rehab, recovery and treatment
This critical category only accounts for about 6% of all spending from local opioid settlement funds last year. Most localities opted to support these services through donations to different nonprofits that focus on people with substance use disorder.
Several localities also focused their funding on Day Report Centers, which are often used as alternative-sentencing programs for people who are arrested and charged with crimes related to drug use. The centers usually operate through counties or multiple counties in regions and run drug testing programs as well as connect individuals to services to help them maintain court-ordered sobriety.
The largest single expenditures for rehab, recovery and treatment services were:

$200,000 from Cabell County for Lily’s Place to support a housing program for mothers and pregnant people who are going through substance use disorder treatment
$85,000 from Sistersville for New Beginnings Recovery to offer transportation to clients for therapy and treatment sessions
$50,000 from Monroe County to the Summers/Monroe Day Report Center
$27,627 from South Charleston to Pollen8, a recovery nonprofit focused on women, for job training and treatment programming
$20,000 from Hardy County to the South Branch Valley Day Report Center

Use this table to search through all first expenditures for rehab, recovery and treatment across the state:
Youth services
From Batman and magicians to drug prevention classes and repairs to a middle school track, localities across West Virginia spent about 6% of all funds on services for children.
Nearly all this funding went toward prevention education, with West Virginia GameChanger receiving more than half of all local spending on youth services.
GameChanger, a politically-connected program, was established in 2018 to teach prevention to kids in the classroom. It’s based on school boards or individual schools paying a varying fee for prevention materials and a curriculum that experts have called questionable and based in fear, which are not conducive to lowering rates of drug use or overdose among students.
The largest single expenditures for youth services were:

$270,000 from Marion County to GameChanger for three years of programming in area schools
$60,000 from Hardy County for repairs to the track at Moorefield Middle School
$18,000 from Hardy County to nonprofit Big Blue, a teen center, to pay for an executive director, among other things
$10,000 from Bluefield to purchase land for a youth summer camp 
$10,000 from Oceana for a “drug awareness magician, drug awareness special needs fishing tournament” and prevention educational materials

Use this table to search through all first expenditures for children across the state:
Government transfers
The approved uses for opioid settlement dollars are, generally, broad. They’re set through a memorandum of understanding created by the courts through negotiations with the attorney general and local leaders when the overarching opioid settlement fund was established. 
It’s unclear what exact approved use would allow governments to take money from their opioid settlement shares; the closest would likely be the secondary core strategy of “leadership, planning and coordination.” That strategy — per the memorandum — allows funds to be used for staff and government infrastructure, but mostly with a focus on oversight for opioid abatement programming.
Despite the approved use not being clear, two governments — Oceana and Williamson — used portions of their funds to cover shortfalls within their general funds. Oceana has paid or is in the process of paying all these expenditures back. It’s unclear if Williamson plans to do the same.
Another government transfer came from Mingo County paying $150,000 to Kermit to honor an agreement between the county and city that was made in regards to the opioid settlement dollars.

Memphis education leaders are pushing back on what they call misleading and offensive language from lawmakers leading the charge to turn over control of the school district to the state.
Rep. Mark White and Sen. Brent Taylor, both Republicans from Memphis, told WKNO/Channel 10 earlier this month that in January they will bring back their bills to create a state-appointed board to lead Memphis Shelby-County schools. In the interview, Taylor called the current school board members “dumba**es.”
“The school board ranks right up there with jock itch, in terms of what people think about them,” he said.
The district declined to comment, and Taylor did not respond to Chalkbeat’s requests for comment. But a school board member and local advocates condemned Taylor’s language.
Taylor is known for making off-color and often incendiary public comments, particularly during General Assembly debates. While the comments aren’t surprising, education officials in Memphis say the rhetoric further inflames already tense relations between city and state officials.
“I think he’s become emboldened, given the tenor of our current national politics that has trickled down into our state and is now trying to trickle down into our local politics,” said MSCS board member Natalie McKinney.
The school board faced backlash in the winter for ousting former Superintendent Marie Feagins, a move White and others publicly urged against. Feagins filed a lawsuit against the board in February, saying her firing violated the Tennessee Open Meetings Act.
The district in recent years has faced significant academic and financial challenges, in addition to repeated administrative drama at the superintendent level. Feagins lasted less than 10 months in the job before her ouster, which prompted White to introduce his bill to rework district leadership.
In an interview, White told Chalkbeat that he’s not worried about the senator’s language.
“We’ve all got our style, so I’ll let Senator Taylor do his thing,” White said. “He’s doing a great job as far as I’m concerned.”
But Cardell Orrin, who leads Stand for Children Tennessee, a Memphis-based nonprofit working to promote equity in school outcomes, called the senator’s language “very clearly offensive.”
“We have a high tolerance for ignorance here, but this white suburban Republican legislator is comparing school board members, who are mostly Black women, to jock itch,” he said. “This senator whose main hashtag is ‘Make Memphis Matter’ … is doing all of these things to assert control over this place that he doesn’t live in.”
During the WKNO interview, lawmakers cited MSCS’ recent state test scores as a main reason a leadership change is needed, calling the “small incremental increases” insufficient. Just over 29% of the district’s students in grades 3-5 passed in reading this year, a critical reading benchmark for the state, up from 26% in 2023-24.
“We’re not meeting the mark on preparing our Memphis-Shelby County students, which are the inner city kids, to be able to get those jobs and to move out of high school,” White told Chalkbeat. “It’s no longer about any particular school board or any particular superintendent. This has been going on for decades, and it’s just time for intervention.”
Dolores Rivers, interim director of the Memphis-Shelby County Education Association and a retired teacher of 26 years, said that minimizing the district’s progress is “a slap in the face of the teachers that are in the classroom.”
“People need to understand that our kids come to us behind; they start behind,” she said. “Proficiency is the goal that we’re trying to attain. Growth is the path.”
MSCS outpaced average state improvement on some testing benchmarks, including third-grade reading proficiency. But the district continues to lag behind statewide results, with 41.7% of all Tennessee third graders scoring proficient on the test. White said getting MSCS to hit that state figure is the goal.
While on WKNO, White and Taylor compared MSCS test scores to smaller, less diverse nearby school systems like the University Schools, which is an independent public school system that’s been run by the University of Memphis since 2024.
But Rivers said those comparisons are unfair, noting that the district has a waiting list.
“We have to accept everybody,” she said.
Memphis students have to apply to the University Schools system, and are required to show a “satisfactory conduct grade and attendance record” to be admitted. White said the schools serve “many of the same students” as MSCS because they pull from the same ZIP codes.
“And whether it’s fair or not, that’s not the point,” he said. “The point is, year after year, Memphis-Shelby County Schools does not perform.”
In their WKNO interview, Taylor and White said the University School system serves an equal number of white and Black students. But according to a 2024 report, 31% of the district’s 1,200 students are Black and 53% are white.
And 2024 data from the Tennessee Department of Education shows that the percentage of economically disadvantaged students in the University Schools system ranged from 7% in elementary to 14% in middle school, compared to 53% of MSCS students district-wide.
McKinney said those differences in student demographics matter.
“This attempt to dissect poverty from the ability to take advantage and have full access to all your educational opportunities is something that we need to stop lying to ourselves about,” she said.
Orrin was one of many community leaders to launch the “Save Our Students” initiative fighting against the previous round of state takeover bills in the spring. He acknowledged that there is “a lot to improve at the district,” including holding board members and district leadership accountable.
But Orrin says the lawmakers’ reasons for upending the MSCS school board “keep changing over time,” and the $6 million forensic audit set to start this month — which the lawmakers said will guide their efforts going forward — will only make that worse.
“They’re on a hunt for why they’re doing the state takeover again, so it’s another rationale,” he said. “Again, we don’t have any context or any prior consideration of what they’re looking for.”
The state hasn’t conducted an independent investigation of any other system, Orrin said. And the lawmakers admitted they’ll likely only have partial results by the time the legislative session ends.
White says he’s confident the partial results will be enough to inform how he and Taylor can reconcile the two state takeover proposals the duo introduced earlier this year. But he said there’s nothing the audit could find that would make him change his mind.
“We need more than advisers right now,” he said. “You have to have this complete overhaul to break down that bureaucracy.”

The U.S. Justice Department is asking Michigan for a copy of its voter rolls and information about how the state maintains them, as well as a series of questions about its high levels of voter registration.
In its letter to Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, dated July 21 and obtained by Votebeat, the Justice Department also said it has received a complaint about the state’s compliance with a provision in federal law requiring all voters to be assigned unique identifiers.
It is the latest in a series of letters the Justice Department has sent to states about their management of voter rolls, following directives in President Donald Trump’s March executive order on elections.
The DOJ included a series of questions based on Michigan’s responses to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s Election Administration and Voting Survey, a compendium of data about election administration. The survey was released June 30.
Angela Benander, spokesperson for Michigan’s Department of State, said the department was reviewing the letter. In a text message to Votebeat, Benander said state officials “don’t accept the premise that we are somehow in violation” of the Help America Vote Act, the statute the Justice Department said was the subject of the complaint.
“These issues have been in federal court and two judges have ruled in our favor,” Benander said, referring to past lawsuits over the state’s voter list maintenance.
Republicans at all levels of government have long questioned the high rate of registration in Michigan, which has made registration easier in recent years by allowing same-day registration and automatically registering any eligible person who gets a driver’s license, for example.
Before the 2024 election, a misleading claim circulated saying that Michigan had more registered voters than residents 18 and older. That claim didn’t account for inactive voters who have likely died, moved, or otherwise become ineligible, but whose names can’t legally be removed from the rolls until a certain amount of time has passed.
As for some of the other questions in the letter, Charles Stewart, a political science professor and director of MIT’s Election Lab, said that they don’t necessarily indicate the state has done anything wrong. Duplicate registrations, for example, could be easily attributed to the way a state handles data or any of a number of other “pretty anodyne explanations,” Stewart said.
He said it’s possible that Michigan needs to improve its list maintenance practices but said the Justice Department letter “treats the EAVS data as gospel without really understanding well what the data-generating process is.”
“There is not necessarily an error so much as there’s 55 different ways of generating these numbers,” he said of EAVS. “There’s not a standard … which all election departments are required to follow.”
The DOJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Vladimir Vladimirov | Getty Images)In a few short years, West Virginia has banned trans kids from accessing necessary medical care, excluded them from participating in sports with their peers, and will now force teachers to out them to their families. And those are just the bills that have passed.
Proposed legislation has included bills that would label the very existence of trans and nonbinary people as “obscene,” prohibiting us from so much as existing in the same neighborhood as a school. In Arkansas, conservative lawmakers even sought to ban certain haircuts according to sex. Assigned female at birth, whether or not that’s how you identify? Your hairstylist could be dragged to court and lose everything they have just for giving you a short bob. Transphobia and anti-trans rhetoric are soaring, with bigots whipping people into a frenzy over gender-diverse people.
What these people don’t realize is that they’re being puppeteered by a well-financed, coordinated campaign to make them hate their fellow human beings. These tactics have consequences, and they can cost young people their lives. I can quote figures to you all day: 82% of trans youth have considered taking their own lives; trans military members are 20% more likely to complete suicide than their cisgender peers; gender-affirming care like hormone therapy can halve the risk of suicidal ideation in young people; and simply having one accepting adult in their life can cut the risk by 40%.
While the numbers are staggering, I haven’t found them to be particularly effective in humanizing my community to people who don’t know us. But a good story that, unlike all the fear-mongering from the other side, happens to be true? That can and does change hearts and minds.
That’s why I spent over a year traveling the country to write “American Teenager,” a groundbreaking nonfiction book following the lives of eight trans and nonbinary kids all across America. My hope in writing it was to illustrate what should already be self-evident: Trans kids are just kids, no different than any other kid. But more than that, they are human beings, ones deserving of the same respect afforded to everyone else on this planet. That basic dignity is precisely what they have been denied.
The kids who were brave enough to share their stories in “American Teenager” deserve so much more than their lawmakers have given them. Mykah, who lives in the outskirts of Charleston with their mother, watched from the balcony of the state Capitol building in February 2023 as their friends and community members begged for a future in their own state. The pleas were largely ignored: The vast majority of Republican lawmakers, many of whom would ultimately vote in favor of anti-trans legislation, declined the opportunity to be present to hear the public’s testimony. They were appealing to an empty legislature. 
Although supporters of laws stripping away Mykah’s right to exist as themself claim that they are protecting children, these policies do nothing to address the real problems facing their family. At the time the book was being written, Mykah was on the verge of failing to graduate amid a severe mental health crisis. Their mother, Dawn, was drowning: She could barely afford to put food on the table, let alone be the support her child so desperately needed.
Today, Mykah is in a good place. They have a steady job and are on their way to a brighter tomorrow, with no help from their lawmakers. But many of their peers are not doing so well: Several of the teens in “American Teenager” have been forced to flee their home states, even the country, amid a nationwide epidemic of bills like those introduced in West Virginia. Ruby, a self-described “church girl” from a devout religious family, had been planning a move to California but is now starting over in Europe — where she will be thousands of miles away from her family. Wyatt has moved twice in the past year, unsure of where home is if it’s not South Dakota.
Trans teens have been forced to become refugees in their own country, treated like deviants and criminals all because they dare to live their most authentic truth. In writing “American Teenager,” my hope was that everyone who has been manipulated into discriminating against children do what lawmakers have been so loath to: actually get to know them. By having the chance to spend time with Mykah, Ruby and Wyatt, to learn their stories and meet their loving families, the public can see the harm that fear and misinformation has caused. We can begin to undo the damage.
October will mark the one-year anniversary of  the publication of “American Teenager,” and since its debut, I have been working to bring this book to as many communities as I possibly can. With only extremely modest financial backing, I have held more than 80 book events in 36 states, not including the District of Columbia. My hope is to eventually make it to all 50. I will keep traveling for as long as it takes to ensure these young voices are heard.
On Saturday, July 26 at 1 p.m, Mykah will join me for a reading and Q&A at the South Charleston Public Library, my 83rd tour date so far. It will be the first time that I have seen them since the book was written, and I can’t wait to see this flamboyant, ambitious person who brings out the best in those around them. Mykah is a walking dream factory: constantly ideating their next steps toward stardom, as if celebrity were simply inevitable. That optimism is infectious. It makes you believe not only in their vision but to think of what could be possible for all of us, if only we regained our capacity to hope.
I hope that, one day, West Virginia will be a better place for the Mykahs of the world. I hope they have all the spaces in this country they need to thrive. All it takes is to start listening to them.

“Sin mi familia, no soy nada”, decía el asunto de un correo electrónico enviado por Gabe Evans, quien en ese momento era representante estatal, a sus partidarios el 10 de septiembre de 2023.
El correo electrónico anunciaba la candidatura de Evans para el octavo distrito congresional de Colorado, y comenzaba con una historia que el republicano de Fort Lupton ha contado varias veces a lo largo de su carrera política: la historia de su abuelo, Cuauhtemoc Chavez, que nació en México y obtuvo la ciudadanía estadounidense a través de su servicio en el ejército en la Segunda Guerra Mundial.
“Mi familia luchó con uñas y dientes por el sueño americano para que futuras generaciones como yo pudieran tener una vida mejor”, escribió Evans. “Y pienso compensarlos plenamente por ello”.
Como estrella en ascenso en el Partido Republicano de Colorado y fiel partidario de la agenda del presidente Donald Trump en el Congreso, Evans se ha apoyado fuertemente en su herencia mexicoamericana y en el hombre al que se refirió en el vídeo de su campaña como su “abuelito Chavez”. Contar y volver a contar la historia de su abuelo, que murió en 2014, es el método que utiliza Evans para hacer que las políticas históricamente extremas de deportación masiva apoyadas por Trump y sus principales asesores parezcan más moderadas.
“Somos una nación gobernada por la ley”, dijo Evans a los moderadores en un debate en enero de 2024, respondiendo a una pregunta sobre cómo se debería tratar a “millones de personas que viven ilegalmente en Estados Unidos”. Evans dijo, “Tienes que ponerte en esa fila y hacerlo de la manera correcta, de la manera legal, para no pasar por encima de gente como mi abuelo, que lo hizo de la manera correcta y de la manera legal”.
Pero Evans ha caracterizado incorrectamente la historia de cómo sus antepasados de la época de la Depresión lograron el sueño americano, y ha dicho incorrectamente fechas y detalles clave en la biografía de su abuelo, según documentos obtenidos por Newsline a través de investigaciones de archivo y solicitudes de registros gubernamentales.

Esos registros muestran que la familia Chávez, y en particular un joven Cuauhtémoc, estaban claramente en el lado equivocado de la “políticas de inmigración fuertes” que su nieto ahora invoca su nombre para defender.
Un documento del Servicio de Inmigración y Naturalización de 1941, obtenido mediante una solicitud de registros ante el Servicio de Ciudadanía e Inmigración de Estados Unidos, demuestra que Cuauhtemoc entró al país ilegalmente con su madre y hermanos en 1929, a la edad de 5 años, y residió ilegalmente en Texas durante los 12 años intermedios. El documento, conocido como formulario de registro de extranjero, o AR-2, se preparó poco después de que Cuauhtemoc, que tenía 16 años en ese momento, fuera arrestado por una “violación de inmigración” en El Paso y “fue objeto de un proceso de deportación”.
Al menos dos hermanas de Cuauhtemoc fueron arrestadas por agentes de inmigración el mismo día, según documentos casi idénticos que se les prepararon. Los tres reportaron haber cruzado el puente de la calle Santa Fe hacia El Paso el 9 de diciembre de 1929. En el lugar donde se indica el motivo de su viaje a Estados Unidos, aparecen las mismas palabras en los tres documentos: “vivir, entrada ilegal”.
El formulario AR-2 de Cuauhtemoc también incluye un arresto previo sin fecha por “intento de robo”, lo que convierte al joven de 16 años en parte de una categoría de inmigrantes que Evans ha dicho que sin excepción deberían ser deportados. Evans fue un firme defensor de la Ley Laken Riley, aprobada por la mayoría republicana en el Congreso en enero y que exige que los agentes federales de inmigración prioricen la detención de inmigrantes indocumentados arrestados por un delito de robo, hurto, latrocinio o hurto en tiendas.
En las semanas antes de la publicación de este artículo, Evans pareció reconocer o aceptar la afirmación de que su abuelo había entrado al país ilegalmente en al menos dos entrevistas. Su oficina no pudo señalar ejemplos de revelaciones similares durante las elecciones de 2024 ni antes. Delanie Bomar, su portavoz, afirmó inicialmente que Evans había sido “muy coherente” y “claro” sobre la historia de su familia, pero después dijo que sus comentarios podrían haber sido “confusos”.
“En la cultura hispana, inmigrar de la ‘manera correcta’ generalmente significa trabajar duro, contribuir a su comunidad y no causar problemas; no necesariamente que algo sea 100% perfectamente legal”, escribió Bomar en un correo electrónico.
Evans ha descrito a su abuelo migrando “legalmente” o “de la manera legal” en múltiples ocasiones, y tan recientemente como el 24 de junio. Bomar se negó a responder preguntas sobre esa redacción y rechazó varias solicitudes de entrevistar a Evans para este artículo. Tras recibir una lista detallada de preguntas sobre los documentos obtenidos por Newsline y el historial de declaraciones falsas de Evans sobre el historial migratorio de su abuelo, sus representantes no respondieron a más preguntas, ignorando más de una docena de mensajes de seguimiento por teléfono, mensaje de texto y correo electrónico.

“Estoy más sorprendida que nada, pero al mismo tiempo, realmente no me sorprende”, dijo Keilly Leon, organizadora regional del norte de la Coalición por los Derechos de los Inmigrantes de Colorado.
“Creo que esto demuestra lo feo que es esta retórica: ‘Lo hice bien’ versus ‘Lo hice mal’”,  dijo Leon, residente de Greeley y beneficiario de la Acción Diferida para los Llegados en la Infancia (DACA). “Incluso quienes emigraron hace décadas… experimentaron que el gobierno ha permitido continuamente que este sistema fallido separe a las familias y obligue a las personas a buscar otras maneras de entrar al país”.
 Actitudes anti inmigrantes familiares

La historia de la familia de Evans resonó entre los votantes del octavo distrito de Colorado, donde más de 3 de cada 10 residentes son mexicano-americanos, lo que lo ayudó a él y a otros republicanos a ganar una elección de 2024 definida en gran parte por cuestiones de inmigración y fronteras. Su distrito, diseñado por una comisión de redistribución de distritos independiente en 2021, incluye los suburbios del norte de Denver y partes del condado rural de Weld.
“Mi historia es la misma que la de muchos otros en la comunidad hispana que lo hicieron de manera correcta”, dijo en una entrevista radial el 24 de junio. “Se tomaron el tiempo y el esfuerzo de venir aquí legalmente, de construir un negocio, de formar una familia. Y luego se dan la vuelta y ven a un grupo de personas cruzando la frontera sur, recibiendo literalmente dinero de los contribuyentes por todas las diferentes medidas que les impuso la administración Biden”.
Tal retórica de Evans, Trump y otros políticos de derecha provocó una “fractura” entre los votantes latinos, dijo Romeo Guzmán, profesor adjunto de historia en la Universidad Claremont Graduate, quien estudia inmigración. Sin embargo, dijo que esto podría estar cambiando rápidamente a medida que los agentes de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE) comiencen a implementar la agenda republicana. Una encuesta de CBS News publicada el domingo mostró que el apoyo a los planes de inmigración de Trump ha caído, y una estrecha mayoría de estadounidenses se opone ahora a su programa de deportación.
“Hay cierta tensión ahora, entre quienes votaron por Trump, que piensan que son diferentes de estos inmigrantes no autorizados, entre comillas, ‘ilegales’”, dijo Guzmán. “Lo que están descubriendo es que, en realidad, para la administración Trump, para el ICE, esas diferencias no son tan claras como quizás imaginaban”.
Antes de que su nieto repitiera su historia durante la campaña electoral, Cuauhtemoc Chavez pertenecía a una generación anterior de inmigrantes que enfrentaron obstáculos y prejuicios similares a los que enfrentan los inmigrantes de hoy.
Después de la larga y sangrienta revolución de su país, un número récord de mexicanos entraron a Estados Unidos tanto legal como ilegalmente durante la década de 1920. Las llegadas alimentaron una campaña restriccionista que condujo a la aprobación de la Ley de Extranjeros Indeseables de 1929, que amplió los poderes federales de deportación y, por primera vez, convirtió el cruce de la frontera sin autorización en un delito menor.
La bisabuela de Evans, Luz García Chávez, cruzó a El Paso con sus hijos cinco meses después del inicio de la ley, según los registros del INS. Sin demostración de entrada legal, la familia Chávez se unió a una gran población de extranjeros considerados “extranjeros deportables” según la ley de inmigración estadounidense.
El sentimiento anti inmigrante se profundizó durante la infancia de Cuauhtémoc en la década de 1930. Con la llegada de la Gran Depresión, se culpó a los inmigrantes de quitarles empleos a los ciudadanos y de usar los programas de asistencia social estatales y federales. Muchas personas empezaron a asociar a los jóvenes mexicoamericanos como gánsteres traficantes de licor y luego, tras la derogación de la Ley Seca en 1933, como traficantes de marihuana y otras drogas. Las deportaciones aumentaron, mientras que hasta un millón de recién llegados y sus hijos, algunos de ellos nacidos en Estados Unidos, fueron presionados para regresar a México como parte de lo que se conoció como el movimiento de “repatriación”.
“Hay mucha coerción y muchas tácticas de miedo”, dijo Guzmán. “Una de las que está muy bien documentada es esta gran redada en La Placita Olvera en Los Ángeles, muy similar a las que estamos viendo ahora: intentar hacer una demostración de fuerza para que la gente regrese”.
 Caracterizaciones incorrectas y discrepancias

En ocasiones, las declaraciones de Evans sobre su abuelo han contenido caracterizaciones incorrectas, como una publicación de Facebook del 24 de junio de 2024 diciendo que Cuauhtémoc había “emigrado… en busca de un lugar más seguro para criar una familia”. Un día después, Jennifer Chavez, hija de Cuauhtemoc y tía de Evans, respondió a su publicación.
“Cuando tu abuelo emigró de México, tenía 5 años”, escribió Jennifer. “No seas engañoso.”
En una declaración de 2022 al periódico en español La Prensa de Colorado, Evans, quien era candidato por primera vez a la Cámara estatal, escribió que Cuauhtémoc había “adquiriendo la ciudadanía en 1943”, mientras servía en el Ejército. Los registros muestran que no solicitó la naturalización hasta varios años después, en 1946. La discrepancia es significativa porque la petición de naturalización de Cuauhtemoc indica que se le concedió la ciudadanía en virtud de una ley de 1944 que eliminó la prueba de “entrada legal” como requisito para la naturalización.
Evans repitió la cronología inexacta durante su campaña para el Congreso de 2024. Él dijo al Berthoud Weekly Surveyor que “a Cuauhtemoc le tomó 13 años obtener su ciudadanía”, comparando su espera con una historia que escuchó durante la campaña electoral sobre un residente de Colorado que “trató legalmente de obtener la ciudadanía durante 17 años”. Pero Cuauhtemoc afirmó dos veces,primero en su formulario AR-2 de 1941 y luego en su solicitud de ciudadanía de 1946, que no había solicitado la naturalización previamente.

Cuando Newsline la contactó, Jennifer Chavez dijo que si bien no le sorprendió la noticia de que la familia de su padre había entrado al país ilegalmente. “Así era la vida en ese entonces”, dijo, y su estatus indocumentado no era algo de conocimiento común en la familia.
“No creo que nadie en la familia haya visto nada de eso”, dijo Jennifer sobre los formularios del INS que obtuvo Newsline.
Como muchas familias estadounidenses, los Chavez están divididos por la política, y la reiterada invocación de Evans a Cuauhtemoc para defender las políticas republicanas agravó la división. Jennifer, quien dijo que vio a Evans en persona por última vez en una boda en 2020, escribió un artículo de opinión el año pasado oponiéndose a su candidatura al Congreso. En una entrevista, dijo que su padre y su sobrino se encontraban en bandos opuestos debido a un distanciamiento familiar que se remontaba a décadas.
“Gabe, en realidad, apenas conocía a mi papá”, dijo. “Simplemente no se veían muy a menudo. Mi hermana (la madre de Evans) ya no conectaba con la familia… Él intenta cultivar la herencia latina, pero en realidad no conocía a mi padre, porque rara vez lo veía”.
Los representantes de Evans no respondieron a las reiteradas solicitudes para responder a la caracterización de Jennifer de su relación con su abuelo.
“Que Gabe presente a mi padre como partidario de alguien como Trump está mal”, dijo Jennifer. “Realmente tergiversó la identidad de mi padre”.
Cuando se le preguntó sobre otra línea del correo electrónico de anuncio de campaña de Evans, en el que decía que su madre, Rebecca Chávez, “pensaba que pasaría toda su vida en una choza de una sola habitación con piso de tierra en Juárez, México”, Jennifer Chávez empezó a reír.
“Nos criamos en un barrio de clase media de El Paso”, dijo. “Fuimos a la escuela Eastwood, que era predominantemente caucásica… Hasta el día de hoy, ninguna de nosotros hablamos español con fluidez”.
 ‘Tienes que regresar’

Durante la campaña de 2024, Evans, aunque evitó responder la pregunta directamente, afirmó repetidamente su apoyo a los planes de Trump de deportar a los aproximadamente 12 millones de personas que viven en el país sin estatus legal permanente.
“Si no estás aquí legalmente, tienes que regresar”, dijo cuando se le preguntó si apoyaba la estrategia de Trump de “deportarlos a todos” durante un debate de las primarias de junio de 2024. “Sí, regresas y esperas en la fila como todos los demás en una sociedad que respeta la ley”.

Suavizó esa postura con su copatrocinio, el 15 de julio, de la “Ley de Dignidad”, una propuesta bipartidista para brindar alivio de la deportación a algunos inmigrantes indocumentados.
El alivio propuesto dista de las medidas que permitieron al abuelo de Evans y a otros miembros de la familia Chavez obtener la ciudadanía estadounidense. Solo quienes ingresaron al país antes de 2021 serían elegibles para el programa. Quienes califiquen deberán pagar $7,000 de restitución y se les prohibirá el acceso a beneficios federales. El programa ofrecería estatus legal, pero no una vía para obtener la ciudadanía, ni siquiera para los llamados Dreamers, quienes, como el abuelo de Evans, fueron traídos a Estados Unidos de niños.
“Sin amnistía. Sin ayudas. Sin ciudadanía”, declaró la representante republicana de Florida María Salazar, co patrocinadora de Evans, en un comunicado de prensa que anunciaba el proyecto de ley.
Evans no respondió a preguntas sobre si apoya el programa DACA o una vía a la ciudadanía para quienes se encuentran actualmente en Estados Unidos sin documentos, ni por qué cree que los inmigrantes de hoy deberían recibir un trato diferente al que recibió la familia de su abuelo. Tampoco respondió a preguntas sobre si considera haber descrito incorrectamente la historia de su abuelo ni si planea cambiar su forma de hablar al respecto en el futuro.
La tensión ha aumentado en muchas partes del país en los últimos meses a medida que los agentes del ICE comienzan el cambio operativo necesario para lograr los objetivos de deportación masiva de Trump. La proporción de personas detenidas por el ICE sin antecedentes penales ha aumentado drásticamente, según datos de la agencia analizados por el Proyecto de Datos de Deportación de la Facultad de Derecho de la Universidad de California en Berkeley. En Colorado, entre los arrestados recientemente por la agencia se incluyen una familia con un niño de un año que asistía a una audiencia en un tribunal de inmigración en Denver; una estudiante de enfermería de Utah de 19 años sin antecedentes penales, detenida tras una parada de tráfico cerca de Grand Junction; y la destacada defensora de los derechos de los inmigrantes, Jeanette Vizguerra, una abuela detenida frente a su lugar de trabajo, Target.
Evans ha desestimado las preocupaciones sobre la expansión de la actividad del ICE, acusando a los críticos de “difamar a los agentes del orden que trabajan para mejorar la seguridad de nuestras comunidades”. Defendió la ampliación de la financiación de la agencia, propuesta por el proyecto de ley de reconciliación republicano, un paquete de 80 billones de dólares destinado a cuadruplicar la escala de sus operaciones de detención y expulsión. Ha seguido haciendo eco de la retórica anti inmigrante que se dirigía contra jóvenes como su abuelo hace un siglo, incluyendo la difusión de afirmaciones falsas sobre las tasas de delincuencia tras la afluencia de inmigrantes a Denver, y ha criticado las políticas de “santuario” de Colorado y un programa estatal que ofrece cobertura médica a niños indocumentados.
Hay un creciente temor por la represión de Trump, dijo Leon, entre los inmigrantes del condado de Weld, un área más rural que carece de la red más vocal y organizada de grupos de defensa que existe en Denver.
“Estamos viendo que los agentes de ICE se están volviendo más impredecibles”, dijo Leon. “Estos billones de dólares que se están destinando a ICE solo perjudican a nuestras comunidades y asustan a nuestros niños, que son una parte importante de la comunidad de Greeley”.
“La idea de que un grupo de personas lo hace ‘de la manera legal’ o ‘de la manera correcta’… la realidad es que esas categorías han sido más ambiguas y confusas de lo que imaginamos”, dijo Guzmán. “Porque ‘la manera correcta’ históricamente depende de las leyes que impiden su movimiento”.
Poco después de su toma de posesión, Trump lanzó un esfuerzo para poner fin a la base legal centenaria de la ciudadanía por derecho de nacimiento, una medida que Evans se negó a tomar una posición sobre. En las últimas semanas, el presidente ha amenazado con “desnaturalizar” muchos inmigrantes legales, incluyendo al candidato a la alcaldía de la ciudad de Nueva York, Zohran Mamdani, y otros opositores políticos. Millones de personas que ingresaron al país en los últimos cinco años lo hicieron como solicitantes de asilo legales o bajo designaciones de libertad condicional humanitaria, como el programa de Estatus de Protección Temporal (TPS), vías legales que la administración Trump ha movido agresivamente para cerrar.
“Si eres refugiado, ¿qué significa ‘el camino correcto’?”, dijo Guzmán. “Significa que llegas a la frontera y solicitas la condición de refugiado”.
“Esto no es una ofensa a nadie; la gente no es historiadora”, dijo Guzmán. “El problema, por supuesto, surge cuando la gente empieza a afirmar que su familia lo hizo de una manera, y se pregunta: ‘¿Por qué no puedes hacerlo tú de esa manera?’. Esto suele ser una señal de desconocimiento tanto de su propia historia familiar como de las maneras más generales en que la historia de la inmigración nos ha afectado”.

(Getty Images)One of the most prominent bigots in recent Colorado history is a man named Bill McCartney.
The peak of his anti-LGBTQ+ hate came in 1992, when he emerged a key proponent of Amendment 2, which prohibited the state from adopting anti-descrimination protections for gay and lesbian Coloradans. He said homosexuality is “an abomination.”
McCartney was an evangelical preacher. But the main source of his influence was his record as a football coach at University of Colorado Boulder, where he took his 1990 team to the Orange Bowl and won.
It’s for his feats on the field that CU wants to honor McCartney by erecting a statue of the man on the campus of the state’s flagship public university. This would be an abomination, and the statue project should be spiked.

McCartney, who died in January, began coaching at CU in 1982. It wasn’t long before he was conducting prayer with players at games and team meals, drawing objections from critics such as the American Civil Liberties Union. He founded the men-only Christian organization Promise Keepers, which in 1997 gained widespread attention when an event it staged became one of the largest-ever gatherings in Washington, D.C. The group proselytized a model of the “godly man” who embraces his role as faithful head of the household. One of the “promises” this man must make is to practice “sexual purity.” Critics highlighted how the Promise Keepers ethos was denigrating to women.
The group has experienced a resurgence in the age of Trumpism and is squarely aligned with MAGA. It says its mission is to “make dads great again.”
Colorado voters passed Amendment 2 partly due to the measure’s champions, few of whom were as well-known as McCartney. Stumping for the amendment, he stood at a podium on the CU campus and declared homosexuality to be “an abomination against almighty God.”
The measure’s passage, after which Colorado became known as The Hate State, is perhaps the state’s greatest source of shame since the Japanese incarceration camp at Granada during World War II. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional in 1996, and the state has since come a long way, with a gay man elected twice to its highest office and LGBTQ+ protections adopted into state law.
But the episode remains an indelible stain on the state’s legacy. Coloradans should do everything they can to ensure further progress on equality and defend rights already achieved. But a statue for McCartney would lionize a bigot and symbolize a reversal of progress.
In 2010, McCartney attempted an apology, but it was a sorry-you-were-offended sort of gesture that stopped short of affirming the equal humanity of those he had demonized.
“I regret that I gave the impression that I would in any way judge somebody else; I don’t,” McCartney told the Boulder Daily Camera. “I don’t judge anybody. But I can see how that was interpreted, and I’m sorry for that.”
He was angling to get his old coaching job back at the time.
The university notes that the statue, due to be unveiled in the fall, is privately funded, as if to preempt any objection to the use of public money for it. But that’s beside the point. However it’s funded, the statue will tower over countless visitors to Folsom Field as a potent symbol of discrimination.
According to a university list of “all the iconic sculptures” on the Boulder campus, only two people so far have merited memorialization — another football coach, Fred Folsom from the 19th century, and the poet Robert Frost.
If campus leaders want to honor a true local hero with a statue, options abound. How about Clela Rorex, who as the Boulder County clerk in 1975 issued the first same-sex marriage license in the country? She took this courageous act out of “basic human decency,” she said, even as she braved harassment and death threats.
Americans in recent years have realized that monuments to white supremacists and namesake honors for bigots are a disservice to contemporary society and have removed offending specimens.
In 2025, it should be obvious that a public university should take down a monument to someone like McCartney, not put one up.

(Courtesy of Ocean Winds)BOSTON — With the Trump administration creating roadblocks to Massachusetts’s push to meet its climate goals, the Healey administration is eyeing Canadian offshore wind to bring more clean energy to the state, and a key lawmaker is looking to support that effort.
In January, President Trump hit pause on wind projects nationwide, halting all new federal permits on onshore and offshore wind. The latest federal tax bill also dealt the industry a major blow by phasing out the tax credits for offshore wind projects that aren’t in service by the end of 2027.
Massachusetts faces a statutory deadline: It must lock in contracts for at least 5,600 megawatts of offshore wind by 2027. Currently, the state has one offshore wind project – Vineyard Wind 1 – under construction, which will is projected to bring about 800 megawatts to the grid by the end of 2025. The state has delayed finalizing pricing contracts with two other wind developers, which are expected to bring an additional 1,878 megawatts. The state was also planning on purchasing electricity from another project – Vineyard Wind 2 – but the project was shelved in December 2024.
New England grid operator tells Congress offshore wind critical to future power reliability

In light of setbacks to wind energy in the US, Massachusetts’s Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs is potentially looking to procure electricity from planned offshore wind farms in Canada – a development first reported by Canada’s National Observer. Massachusetts officials are exploring the possibility both to meet clean energy goals and to address energy affordability by bringing more electrons to the grid.
Switching from homegrown to Canadian offshore wind will come with challenges like installing more transmission infrastructure to carry the electricity to the state and will result in fewer construction jobs based in Massachusetts.
A spokesperson for the energy office, Maria Hardiman, said in an email that the state is in “regular communication about emerging opportunities to build new energy sources,” and that they are exploring partnerships with Canada to leverage “significant opportunities to construct new onshore and offshore wind projects across Canada and the Northeast region.”
Sen. Michael Barrett of Lexington, the chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, said that he congratulated the governor’s team for coming up with a creative solution and that he would lead the push for laying the legislative groundwork to enable the Healey administration to seek Canadian offshore wind by extending the procurement deadline for the state.
“This becomes a serious possibility for the mid-term and the long-term,” Barrett told CommonWealth Beacon. “It isn’t a short-term substitution for the damage that President Trump is doing to our current offshore wind projects, but there’s a lot of promise here.”
Barrett acknowledged that getting Canadian energy to Massachusetts might pose some problems like building the extra transmission capacity to bring the offshore wind energy over to Massachusetts.
The state’s effort to procure hydropower from Canada was stalled in 2018 when a siting board in New Hampshire didn’t approve Massachusetts’s plan to build a transmission line through the state. Massachusetts pivoted to put the infrastructure in Maine, but after significant backlash there, construction on the transmission line shut down in November 2021. Nearly, two years later, the project resumed after a jury in Maine ruled in favor of the project. The line is expected to be completed and running by 2026, but building a transmission line through different states has introduced years-long delays and higher costs.
For Canadian offshore wind, it is potentially possible to avoid some of those issues by building transmission lines underwater, but that can come with its own financial difficulties, according to Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association.
“Construction of that new transmission, and then the resulting cost from that, particularly as we now look at hundreds of miles either overland or undersea to bring that in, I think that would create real financial challenges,” said Dolan. “I’m skeptical as to whether that’s something that would make sense in any sort of reasonable time frame and cost structure.”
The transmission line could also end up requiring federal permitting, which could introduce another roadblock.
“If this were a project that needed a U.S. federal sign-off in the next three years, we would be in trouble,” said Barrett when asked about potential hurdles to transporting Canadian offshore. “But when it comes to the planning for these huge new construction activities, Trump is already yesterday’s news.”










That comes at a cost of local jobs and local economic development, and it’s why we’ve been such strong supporters of offshore wind development here in Massachusetts and in New England more broadly. But if there’s the opportunity while the federal government is hitting pause on new American offshore wind to take advantage of offshore wind from elsewhere, that would be a positive.


– Kate Sinding Daly, Conservation Law Foundation


Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for Law and Policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, said that the fact that the state is looking at Canadian offshore wind is “music to [her] ears.” But she noted that building offshore wind in Massachusetts would bring economic development and jobs to the state.
“That comes at a cost of local jobs and local economic development, and it’s why we’ve been such strong supporters of offshore wind development here in Massachusetts and in New England more broadly,” said Sinding Daly. “But if there’s the opportunity while the federal government is hitting pause on new American offshore wind to take advantage of offshore wind from elsewhere, that would be a positive.”
Canada is in the process of building out its offshore wind sector and is projected to generate large amounts of surplus power that it would need to export, according to Aegir Insights, a Danish offshore wind consultancy company.
Signe Sørensen, Aegir Insights’s lead analyst for the Americas, said that transmission could likely be built in the water from offshore in Nova Scotia across the Gulf of Maine to transmit power. But Sørensen said that there is uncertainty about whether the Canadian government will continue to support offshore wind projects over the long term and enable large infrastructure projects – like transmission infrastructure – in the U.S.
“However, in a global context, we are starting to see early signs that the offshore wind sector outlook is improving, loosening many of the other restraints that have hobbled offshore wind build-out generally,” said Sørensen “The fact that this is not the case in the U.S. currently is what causes the sector as well as policy makers to start considering the idea of building offshore wind in Canada and then sending the power to the U.S.”

President Donald Trump’s “administration has actually called for deep cuts to education and education programs,” said Tom Harnisch, vice president for government relations at the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association. “We are working to push back against those cuts because we know those programs, be it the Pell Grant program or other federal student aid programs, are absolutely essential for students, and not only student access to higher education, but also completion and helping them throughout their college journey.”
More than 45,000 students across the University System of Maryland received a Pell Grant in fiscal 2024, totaling more than $204 million in aid. About 58,000 students across the system received any kind of federal student aid that year.
Another 6,200 students at state-aided private institutions in the state, such as Johns Hopkins University, McDaniel College or Hood College, got Pell Grants in fiscal 2024.
The total impact of the changes is still unclear — experts Wednesday even differed on who might be affected by the new rules.
Harnisch said that, according to the information he had received from the Senate, the changes in Pell Grant eligibility will mostly affect students with full-ride, athletic scholarships at Division I universities.

But the bill makes no specific mention of athletic scholarships. Rather, it says that beginning July 1, 2026, a student is ineligible for a Pell Grant for “any period for which the student receives grant aid from non-Federal sources, including States, institutions of higher education, or private sources, in an amount that equals or exceeds the student’s cost of attendance for such period.”
Commission members said that, under their reading, the state’s financial aid would now have to be calculated without first considering funds from Pell Grants.
Currently for some state aid, like the Howard P. Rawlings Guaranteed Access Grant, the formula for determining student need is “Pell first,” said Al Dorsett, of the commission’s office of student financial assistance.
“Based off this change, we’ll have to determine the students’ need before Pell is actually considered,” he said.
Commission Chair Cassie Motz said “that would be a huge sea change for Maryland.”
Deputy Higher Education Secretary Elena Quiroz-Livanis added that the timeline for Maryland to change its student aid regulations as a result of the new legislation is “just frankly insufficient.”
“But it is also unclear just exactly what it is that we’re being charged to implement, just again, because we have to go through negotiated rulemaking,” she said. “So it’s not the best place to be in, given all of the changes that we’re trying to enact here in Maryland.”
Motz emphasized that the commission must work alongside other states and with institutions within Maryland.
“We have to come together,” she said. “We need to be very tightly aligned with our institutions of higher education — two-year, four-year, public, private, all of them — because this is a big change.”
While the legislation also allocated $10 billion for the Pell Grant program over the next two years, Harnisch said, there is not enough funding for the program to continue long-term at its current level.
“We’re looking at a long-term Pell Grant shortfall that’s either going to require new investment from Congress or eligibility restrictions or reduction in the maximum Pell award,” Harnisch said. “Historically, Congress has not reduced the maximum Pell Grant award, but they have done eligibility restrictions.”
Commissioners also raised concern with new limits placed on unsubsidized federal loans for students in professional programs such as medical school or law school starting next year.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Under the new law, Harnisch said that students in professional programs will be limited to $50,000 a year in federal loans, to a lifetime limit of $200,000, in addition to their undergraduate student loan caps. Commission Vice Chair Chike Aguh said that those limits could  constrain on fields such as life sciences, which he described as one of Maryland’s “lighthouse industries.”
“Most of the doctors that I know who are borrowing fully are coming out with far more debt than that,” Aguh said. “So the question I think about is, OK, then where are they going to make up that gap?”
Harnisch said that physicians who studied at a public institution typically come out with $250,000 in loans or more — $300,000 if they went to a private school. Once they reach the cap for federal loans, they will have to look to the private market to cover the rest, he said.
Speakers Wednesday also highlighted the impact of other federal policy changes, such as new student visa rules.
“Obviously the big change here over the past six months are these visa cancellations,” said Kamal Essaheb, senior adviser and director of immigrant affairs to Gov. Wes Moore.
Essaheb added that the State Department resumed interviews for new student visas in late June, after suspending them  this spring, but subject to new rules. He said that vetting applicants social media is now “an explicit part of the process,” which also “requires applicants for these visas to both reveal what their social media accounts are, and also make them open to the public.”
Other changes the duration of student visas, Essaheb said. Instead of “duration of status” visas, that granted non-residents entry to the U.S. for as long as it took them to complete their course of study, new visas would have a set expiration date under a proposed new rule. Students who got sick or changed their program might be forced to leave the U.S. and reapply for a visa to return under the new rule.
Essaheb added that there will also be an updated fee schedule for applications. At a minimum, he said, visa applicants will have to pay $250 to receive the paperwork.
“There may be folks who are finding out about some of this information for the first time later in the process, right after they’ve received admission and accepted an offer and are then going through the requisite paperwork,” he said. “The rapidly evolving immigration policy landscape makes it hard for people to not only know their rights, but also their legal obligations.”
Maryland Higher Education Secretary Sanjay Rai said that “despite the challenges higher education may be facing due to policy changes and other external disruptions, we will continue to stand firm in our mission to keep students and their needs at the forefront of our work.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/file-4323-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-24 06:08:12.043064

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)As Virginia lawmakers heard from state health officials Wednesday about potential effects of federal healthcare funding changes approved by Congress earlier this month, it became clear to Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News: “we at this time do not have a true sense of what we’re up against.” 
That’s because of the whiplash created by the swift passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” despite inter-party disagreements, which President Donald Trump signed on July 4 The federal reconciliation bill aimed at reducing taxes for some and increasing federal spending on the U.S. military and border security came at the price of changes to federal healthcare funding that affect hospitals and Medicaid eligibility.
As partisan disputes boil, it’s still unclear how new federal law will impact Medicaid in Virginia

Cheryl Roberts, Virginia’s Medicaid Director, briefed members of Virginia’s Joint Commission on Healthcare about the future landscape of health insurance and hospital funding. 
Of Virginia’s roughly 1.9 million people on Medicaid, those most estimated to be affected, Roberts said, are the over 600,000 that became eligible since Virginia expanded its program in 2018. They will become subject to work requirements and twice-yearly verification for coverage. 
She said the eligibility criteria includes work, community service, education or a combination of these things as long as it amounts to 80 hours per month. What’s still unclear, she said, is what the federal government might deem to fit those requirements more specifically with regards to community service and education. 
Roberts did surmise, however, that the additional verifications will pose challenges for the Department of Social Services and localities to process. 
“Without question. That’s going to be hard on (them),” she said. 
Del. Rodney Willet, D-Henrico, noted how difficult navigating the paperwork can be for some recipients paired with the additional workload on government workers. 
Roberts said that the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance services is going to focus on streamlining the process as much as it can and to make electronic options available. But she estimates half of the verification process is what “we’re going to have to figure out.”
She emphasized that like lawmakers seeking to understand potential and expected impacts, her department is also operating with a lack of clarity for now.
“We do not have [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] guidance for 90% of this, and that’s important,” Roberts said. “When I say ‘we don’t know’ — we really don’t know yet.” 
As the reconciliation bill was fast-tracked through Congress over the summer, hospital associations in numerous states co-signed a public letter warning how funding changes to hospitals would negatively impact their abilities to remain open in some areas or face service cuts in others. 
On Wednesday, Roberts didn’t share a concrete number, but she acknowledged that hospitals stand to lose billions of dollars. Del. Willett had noted an estimate of billions to which Roberts replied: “yes.” 
“We give the hospitals billions of dollars, so the decline would be billions,” she added. 
The Mercury and other media approached Roberts after her presentation for an interview, but were instructed to send emails. The Mercury also emailed to inquire specifically how many billions of dollars could potentially be lost, but did not receive an answer by the time of this publication.
What happens to Medicaid in Virginia if massive federal bill to slash billions becomes law?

While congressional Democrats unanimously opposed the bill, some Republicans were hung up over the proposed hospital funding changes. To bring more Republicans on board, Congress added the Rural Health Transformation Program to funnel $50 billion nationwide for rural hospitals. 
State Sens. David Sutterlein, R-Roanoke, and Chris Head, D-Botetourt, noted how constituents in Head’s predominantly rural district often receive healthcare from facilities in Sutterlein’s. As Sutterlein’s district includes urban and suburban areas like Roanoke and Salem, they questioned how the eligibility would work for hospitals there. 
“There is a foreboding fear among all of the hospital administrators that I’m in contact with,” Head said. “It is going to be critical for us to come up with a plan to triage.”
Such concerns were also relayed by Ballad Health chief operating officer Eric Deaton in a recent call with the Mercury.
As the hospital chain has several rural facilities in Southwest Virginia and Tennessee, Deaton said he wonders how states are going to be able to respond. In the meantime, he said his hospital chain will look inward at how it can adjust and stay connected to federal lawmakers. 
“You’ve got two opportunities (to make up for funding loss) — either increase market share revenue or you decrease your cost,” Deaton said. 
In other words, consumers with private insurance could see rising rates to compensate for care, or certain services at some hospitals could be scaled back or scrapped. 
As uninsured people are more likely to put off care until emergencies arise, the cost of the care is absorbed by hospitals, who periodically negotiate with private insurers. 
Deaton said hospital chains like Ballad are exploring leaning into telemedicine where possible and are in conversations with Virginia and Tennessee’s congressional delegations about what future federal action could undo or soften the blow of this summer’s reconciliation bill. While Congress’ bill passed earlier this month, the changes to hospital funding don’t kick in until 2028 and changes to Medicaid for patients begin in 2027.
“This is not the last bill that Congress is going to pass,” Deaton said. 
In the meantime state lawmakers around the country must contend with how federal changes will affect their constituents. 
Price looks forward to more concrete data that she and her 139 colleagues can work with come next year’s legislative session — or sooner should lawmakers reconvene for a special session. 
“We’re here in summer. We’re starting to think about what legislation could look like for the next session,” she said. “But we’re kind of flying in the dark right now.”

Could there ever be a moment in which the interests of political party leaders and government reform advocates come into alignment? 
In November, we may get a glimpse of what such a moment would look like, after the results of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court retention elections are known.
This unlikely turn of events might appear to be more plausible at that time, in light of the Supreme Court’s critical role in legislative reapportionment. That’s the process by which states draw new legislative district boundaries after each decennial census in order to produce a state map with a roughly equal number of voters in every district. 
When a district has gained population since the most recent census (think Cumberland County, which added an estimated 10,480 residents between 2020 and 2023) or lost population during those years (think Forest County, which shrank by an estimated 509 residents during that period), legislative maps need to be reconfigured in order to make district population totals more or less comparable. 
That’s the point at which opportunities for gerrymandering — manipulating district boundaries in ways that will favor a particular political party — come into play. In 2018, Pennsylvania gained unwelcome national recognition for a congressional map in which a particular district, bizarrely redrawn to maximize the number of voters favoring the majority party, produced an image resembling “Goofy kicking Donald Duck.”

When elected  officials get involved in the redistricting process, the results are going to get skewed in this way, producing a majority-party advantage in future legislative elections for a decade. With the aid of mapping software, it’s now possible to generate maps with a strong partisan bias that technically comply with statutory requirements. 
That’s what happened in 2018, when Democratic candidates won only 92 of the 203 seats available in the Pennsylvania House elections (45 percent), despite having earned 54 percent of the total popular vote in these elections.    
Pennsylvania’s redistricting approach is different from that of most other states.  The process is governed by a five-member legislative reapportionment commission, consisting of two representatives from each party (the majority and minority leaders of the state House and Senate), plus a fifth member appointed by the other four individuals. 
If these four are unable to agree on who should be chosen as the fifth member, then the state Supreme Court makes the call. That’s what happened at the start of the 2021 redistricting process, with the selection of Mark Nordenberg, Chancellor Emeritus of the University of Pittsburgh, as chair.
Like the U.S. Supreme Court, the state Supreme Court is expected to conduct its business in a nonpartisan manner. However if Democrats continue to constitute a majority of the justices sitting on the state Supreme Court, it’s not unreasonable to expect  that the next redistricting process might tend to favor Democrats.  That could be the case with a Supreme Court appointment of the fifth LRC member (assuming that the three incumbent justices on the court receive yes votes in the November retention election). 
Some Democratic politicians might welcome an opportunity to produce their party’s version of the 2018 GOP-leaning map, in order to redraw district boundaries in a way that complies with the rules, while locking in a Democratic Party advantage in legislative races over the next decade. 
After laboring under the burden of GOP-majority dominance for years, some politicians might feel more inclined to support a Democratic-leaning redistricting plan, rather than a more equitable one that would be responsive to the interests of Pennsylvania voters as a whole.

One alternative to this unnecessarily divisive approach: follow the example of Colorado and Michigan, where redistricting is handled by an independent citizens commission that conducts public hearings, shares information about alternative redistricting proposals, and produces district maps based on clear, measurable standards. 
In Pennsylvania, this approach and associated authorizing legislation (House Bill 31 and Senate Bill 131)  are being supported by Fair Districts PA, a nonpartisan, statewide organization, and other anti-gerrymandering groups. [Disclosure: I’m an active Fair Districts PA volunteer. The views expressed here are mine alone].
The most recent Pennsylvania redistricting, conducted In 2021, produced a map that is consistent with these criteria in important respects, as Nordenberg explained in his final report. Although he was a widely respected LRC chair who conducted the commission’s proceedings in an evenhanded manner, the identity of the next LRC chair won’t be known anytime soon. 
Finding a chair with credentials comparable to Nordenberg’s could be extraordinarily difficult in Pennsylvania’s 2031 political environment, which may not be any less turbulent than today’s.
So if it turns out that Democratic justices retain their majority on the Supreme Court in November, what alternative would Republican leaders prefer: a redistricting process strongly influenced by the majority party that produces a legislative map favoring that party? Or a redistricting approach managed by a group of citizens committed to conducting an open process and achieving results that are beneficial to all Pennsylvanians?

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)Regional electric grid operator PJM Interconnection’s capacity auction on Tuesday showed an incredible cost jump, breaking records from last year that led to major increases in bills for some consumers across the 13-state region — and setting the stage for rising electricity bills.
With higher costs on the horizon, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin joined governors from eight PJM states in a letter to the power provider, laying out their irritation with the transmission costs and grid reliability and asking for a say in who will fill the vacant seats on the decision making board.
Youngkin signed the bipartisan letter asking for a meeting this week with PJM leaders to share the governors’ ideas of who should fill the two seats on the Board of Managers. The governors recommended people who are familiar with the energy crisis facing these states and could strengthen the public’s trust.
How the capacity auction works and why higher energy bills are coming
Every year, PJM holds a capacity auction to allow companies to provide the estimated power demand in future years. PJM calculates how much power will be needed in high use days and adds some in reserve. Then, energy providers can bid to provide that power until PJM meets the target estimation. Those funds paid to the bidders come from consumers through their utility bills.
On Tuesday, PJM announced its capacity prices increased from $14.7 billion last year to $16.1 billion at this year’s auction, costs that will be paid by ratepayers in Virginia and the other 12 states in the grid operator’s coverage area, and Washington, D.C., in 2026 and 2027.
Last year, PJM saw a massive jump in the capacity cost for most of the region from $28.92 megawatts a day to $269.92 MW a day. The results of the auction this year to cover the next two years came out to an increase to $329.17 MW per day. Sixty-five million customers in PJM’s footprint could see an additional 5% increase in their bills.
Dominion Energy, which covers about 2.7 million customers in Virginia, was able to avoid the cost increase in 2024 due to the company generating a majority of its own energy, and the rest was mainly managed through wholesale power purchases in the PJM region. Other utilities were not as fortunate and some customers saw double digit dollar increases on their bills across the states. Dominion Spokesperson Aaron Ruby said capacity auction costs only amount to about $2 on a monthly bill.
In PJM’s release about the results of the capacity auction, the organization said the peak load increased year to year by 5400 MW. This was largely driven by data centers, electrification and economic growth.
PJM stated it has worked through more than 60% of the transition backlog in its interconnection queue under new federal reforms with another 63,000 MW in projects slated for review in 2025 and 2026. 
“While more than 46,000 MW of installed capacity of already-approved resources have yet to be built, many are navigating challenges outside PJM’s scope, such as permitting timelines, supply chain constraints and evolving project economics,” the agency stated in the release.
Governors, clean energy advocates sound off
Governors across most of PJM’s coverage area are fed up with the cost of utilities continuing to grow and the transmission organization slow walking some energy project approval that could help support the grid, they said in the July 16 letter they sent to PJM. 
“We are deeply concerned that PJM’s response has been typified by halting, inconsistent steps and rising internal conflicts within the stakeholder community that have recently culminated in the abrupt termination of two long-standing members of the Board of Managers and the imminent departure of the CEO,” the letter stated.
The letter was signed by the governors of Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Virginia. The governor of Ohio later sent a letter in support of the other governors’ requests. Two of those states, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, have recently threatened to leave PJM due to the high rise in energy costs and the slow process of getting more energy sources on the grid. 
Virginia is the top energy importer in the country with 36% of the state’s power coming from other states in 2023. The state is also home to a third of the entire world’s power-thirsty data centers, which has created mounting challenges to provide affordable energy to consumers.
“This is a factor that really influences a lot of the economic engines of their states. And so it makes total sense that they will want to have more engagement to ensure that states are real stakeholders in the process,” said Julia Kortrey, deputy state policy director for Evergreen Action, a national climate change advocacy group.
The governors bashed PJM on its “crisis of confidence” from the states and consumers. 
“At a time of rapidly rising load growth, PJM’s multi-year inability to efficiently connect new resources to its grid and to engage in effective long-term transmission planning has deprived our states of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in investment that may flow to other regions. Now these deficiencies threaten the bedrock reliability and affordability our consumers expect and deserve,” the governors wrote.
Renewable energy advocacy organizations also weighed in on the issues following PJM’s auction.
“Despite repeated warnings from governors, advocates, and industry leaders, PJM continues to slow-walk clean, low-cost energy while doubling down on expensive, unreliable fossil fuels. This year’s auction is a historic and costly reminder for 65 million consumers that PJM’s system is broken,” Kortrey said.
Two seats are vacant on PJM’s Board of Managers, which is tasked with making sure the agency is fulfilling its business, legal and regulatory requirements. It is also supposed to ensure PJM has a reliable grid and administers fair energy markets. The board has nine voting members who serve three-year terms. The PJM CEO sits on the board but does not vote. 
During the May 12 meeting of the board, two incumbent board members did not get enough votes from PJM members to maintain their seats. Members who get a vote in the board makeup are electric distributors, consumer advocate offices, generation owners, transmission owners, and other suppliers. The nine governors who signed the letter have a batch of candidates to fill the two open seats they feel would best understand the challenges the states are facing.
“They must be individuals who understand the concerns of ratepayers facing rising costs and who will be ready to collaborate with the incoming CEO to instill a new, more collaborative and more effective ethos at PJM,” the letter said.
They also ask for a public vote for the new members to bring transparency to the process. The chair of the Board of Managers, David Mills, sent a letter back to the governors explaining how the nominating committee makes their decisions for qualified candidates. He also appeared to take offense to some of the accusations the governors made about the energy provider in their letter.
“PJM’s work has recently been publicly recognized by the current and former chairs of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Our operators are keeping the lights on through some of the most challenging circumstances that any grid operator, anywhere, has faced in its history,” Mills said in his response.
He laid out ways PJM has taken steps to address the concerns brought up by the governors such as the Reliability Resource Initiative, temporary capacity market cap/floor construct, and other methods.
Representatives from the governors’ offices traveled to Pennsylvania for the July 23 meeting to share their thoughts on the nominating process for the board seats. This, just a day after PJM saw another record high year for its capacity auction costs.
The next auction for the 2027/2028 years will be in December of 2025.

A growing number of states are mandating that small employers participate in new retirement programs or offer workers their own plan. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Worried about large numbers of workers without a nest egg, Nevada this month launched a new retirement program for private sector workers who lack access to one.
The program requires employers with six or more employees to participate — unless they already sponsor an employee retirement plan.
Employees, who can opt out, are automatically enrolled in an Individual Retirement Account, or IRA, through regular paycheck deductions.
Nevada State Treasurer Zach Conine hopes the new program, created by lawmakers in 2023, will boost financial literacy and ultimately reduce state costs on social services as more people save for retirement. He said about 500,000 workers were expected to be eligible under the plan — nearly a third of the state’s civilian labor force of 1.68 million.
“We don’t care broadly if someone stays on the Nevada plan or goes out and gets their own retirement savings plan,” said Conine, a Democrat who is running for state attorney general. “We care that people are saving for retirement.”

Nevada is among a growing number of states creating automatic retirement programs for employees of private employers. These programs, known as auto-IRAs, target employees without access to retirement programs through work, aiming to address what groups such as AARP characterize as a national retirement crisis.
So far, 20 states have created retirement programs for private sector workers, according to the Center for Retirement Initiatives at Georgetown University. Those programs are generally overseen by state treasurers and appointed boards. Private contractors administer the investment funds, which can fluctuate with financial markets.
AARP says more than 1 million Americans have enrolled in auto-IRA programs launched by states in recent years. But the group, which advocates for Americans aged 50 and older, says nearly half of private sector workers — 56 million people — still lack access to a retirement plan through work.
“In the long term, this is a problem we need to deal with. But in the short term for those individuals, this is a real crisis,” said David John, senior policy adviser at the AARP Public Policy Institute. “This is something that they are going to be facing soon, and our goal is to make sure that as younger people come along, they are much better prepared than some of the people who went before them.”
While anyone can open a savings or investment account, workers are far more likely to participate in retirement programs funded through simple payroll deductions, John said. And state auto-IRAs require little effort from employees and employers.
“Yes, anyone can go to a financial institution and open an IRA. But the bottom line is, they don’t,” he said.
Unlike state pension programs for public workers including teachers, these auto-IRAs are the sole possession of the worker. That means they are portable, and employees can even rely on those funds for emergency expenses at times, John said.
Some financial services firms have objected to these programs, arguing that they compete with private sector retirement providers.
So far, more liberal states have led the way on auto-IRA programs: Oregon launched the nation’s first in 2017, quickly followed by Illinois and California. But John said there’s growing interest in more conservative states: Nevada’s legislation was sponsored by Democrats, but ultimately signed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo.
“This is not a partisan political issue,” John said. “We are seeing strong interest in a number of red states.”
 Launching new programs

In launching its new auto-IRA, Nevada elected to join an interstate consortium of public auto-IRA plans founded by the Colorado Department of the Treasury. By pooling resources and reducing overhead costs, officials say states can offer lower plan fees to savers.
“Relatively, it’s a lot of work to set one of these things up, but it’s a lot less work if you’re not first,” Conine said.
The Nevada treasurer’s office expected the launch of the program to cost about $1.2 million over two fiscal years — funds that were borrowed from the state and are to be paid back through the collection of retirement participant fees over time.
Colorado Treasurer Dave Young sees the state’s retirement program as both a social and financial cause: It helps workers save for a more dignified retirement and keeps the state from spending more on services in the long run, he said.
“If we don’t take this on and get more people saving for retirement, there’s this massive tax bill awaiting taxpayers to fund safety net services, and why would we do that to our taxpayers?” said Young, a Democrat. “Why not change the trajectory for people? It’s relatively actually a simple solution.”
Red states fight growing efforts to give ‘basic income’ cash to residents

A 2023 report from payroll and benefits company Gusto found the biggest boost in participation came among Coloradans earning the least. Before the mandate, 10% of employees earning $15,000 to $25,000 per year participated in a retirement plan — a share that nearly doubled to 19% afterward.
Gusto also found more small employers started offering 401(k) plans after the state’s program launched in 2022.
Colorado has signed up about 72,000 workers with more than $100 million in savings. About 20% of eligible employees choose to opt out, said Hunter Railey, executive director of the Colorado retirement program.
The state program requires all employers in operation at least two years with five or more employees to participate or offer their own retirement plan.
Railey said it’s an easy process to sign up employers and workers, though an initial challenge was identifying the state’s smallest employers. The state used its unemployment system database and explains the program requirement directly to businesses.
“The final step there is really just communicating effectively that these are required programs, and that failure to comply with this does carry penalties at some point,” Railey said. “…By and large, we found that most if not the overwhelming majority of businesses, if they receive a notice for their business, are going to take action.”
Pennsylvania State Treasurer Stacy Garrity, a Republican, has advocated for a state auto-IRA program. Legislation creating a program passed the Democratic-controlled state House by a single vote along party lines and now awaits action in the Republican-controlled state Senate.
Garrity, who also leads the National Association of State Treasurers’ retirement and pensions committee, said an auto-IRA plan would benefit Pennsylvania businesses, workers and taxpayers.
“These are people we all depend on every day, like the mechanic who keeps our car running and the waitress that tops off our coffee,” she said in a statement to Stateline. “Two million hardworking Pennsylvanians without access to workplace retirement plans deserve to have the same opportunity to save.”
 The opposition

While state retirement programs are growing, they have faced industry opposition.
State chapters of the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents 600,000 small businesses across the country, have opposed some measures. In Pennsylvania, the federation said 84% of surveyed members opposed creation of an auto-IRA, arguing not all employees could afford to invest in retirement and that the new plans imposed too heavy a burden on small businesses.
The organization did not respond to requests for comment.
The National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors, which represents financial services providers in every state, says states should encourage private-sector options rather than setting up competing programs.










If we don't take this on and get more people saving for retirement, there's this massive tax bill awaiting taxpayers to fund safety net services, and why would we do that to our taxpayers?


– Colorado State Treasurer Dave Young


In a statement, Kevin Mayeux, CEO of the association, said access isn’t the only barrier to retirement savings. Many Americans, especially lower-income workers, must balance retirement savings against competing financial priorities including child care and rising costs of living.
The organization said it supports states’ interest in retirement savings, but that lawmakers should focus on private-sector options. Those could include multiple employer plans and pooled employer plans that make it easier for small employers to offer retirement plans at competitive rates.
“In short, NAIFA does not oppose efforts to improve retirement security; we welcome them,” Mayeux’s statement to Stateline said. “But we believe that empowering private-sector solutions, not replacing them with state-run programs, is the path to long-term success.”
But early success among participating states is inspiring more adoption, said Angela Antonelli, a research professor and executive director of the Center for Retirement Initiatives at Georgetown University.
In addition to amassing more than $2 billion in savings for workers, the state programs have encouraged employers to offer their own retirement plans, Antonelli said.
“It’s a huge return on the investment. It’s money well spent,” she said.
Antonelli said many participating workers are younger and will likely move into other jobs or careers over time. The hope is they will continue saving, either through the state-sponsored plans or retirement plans offered by future employers.
While she’s encouraged by the growing interest and adoption of these plans, Antonelli said she hopes to see Congress eventually act by requiring employers to offer retirement plans. A bipartisan group of U.S. House lawmakers reintroduced legislation on the matter in Washington this year, but it has not progressed.
“The goal is to have more states adopt these programs,” she said. “And I think the question is, is there a tipping point at which the federal government will now decide to step in?”

Free.,"‘Big, beautiful’ law draws mostly skeptical reaction in new nonpartisan poll",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/big-beautiful-law-draws-mostly-skeptical-reaction-new-nonpartisan-poll,,"WASHINGTON — A majority of Americans believe Republicans’ “big, beautiful” law will either hurt them or not make much of a difference, according to a poll released Thursday by the nonpartisan health research organization KFF.The survey shows 46% of people expect the new tax and spending cuts law will generally hurt them or their family, while 28% said it likely won’t make much difference and 26% said it will help them.Those beliefs were skewed by political parties, with 54% of Republicans saying the law will help them or their family, compared to 19% of independents and 7% of Democrats.People enrolled in Medicaid, the state-federal health program for lower income individuals and people with disabilities, have significant concerns about how changes to the program will impact them.Sixty-five percent of Medicaid patients under the age of 65 said they expect the law to hurt them or their family. Another 17% said it won’t make much of a difference for them and 18% expect the policy changes to help.The law makes more than a dozen changes to how Medicaid is run, resulting in a $1.058 trillion spending cut to the program during the next decade, according to an analysis released earlier this week by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.The report projects that 10 million people will lose access to health insurance before 2034.The law made permanent the 2017 tax cuts from President Donald Trump’s first term and provided billions to carry out his plans of mass deportations, an immigration crackdown and increased defense spending.Some know little about new lawKFF’s survey shows most Americans know at least something about the new law, though 9% of those polled said they know nothing at all and 23% said they know just a little.Democrats had the highest percent of respondents who said they knew either a lot, 35%, or some, 45%, about the law. Twenty-two percent of Republicans said they knew a lot about their party’s top legislative achievement this year, with 44% saying they knew something, 27% saying they knew a little and 7% saying they knew nothing.Social mediaThe vast majority of those polled, 78%, said they saw information about Republicans’ new law on social media during the last month.Facebook and YouTube were the more popular social media platforms for people to see information about the tax and spending cuts law, followed by Instagram, TikTok, X and Reddit.Forty-seven percent of those surveyed said the content they saw on social media opposed the policy changes included in the law, while 41% said it was mixed and 11% said it supported the GOP’s work.Republicans said 26% of what they viewed on social media was in support of the law, with 53% mixed and 21% opposed.

Byron Donalds (R) (Photos via the Governor's Office and the U.S. House.)A new survey of nearly 800 Florida Republican voters shows Casey DeSantis with a slight lead over Byron Donalds in the race for the GOP gubernatorial primary election taking place next year. Donalds soars to a 15-point lead over the First Lady of Florida, though, when the poll is narrowed down to Republican voters who voted in the last GOP primary election.
The University of North Florida’s Public Opinion Research Lab (PORL) shows DeSantis leading Donalds, 32%-29%. Another 8% say they support former Panhandle U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, 2% support Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, and 1% back Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson.
Seven percent of Republicans polled say they would vote for someone else, while 18% say they don’t know who they would vote for.
Several polls of GOP voters released this year show the First Lady is competitive with Donalds, a third-term U.S. Rep. from Southwest Florida, even though she has not announced if she will seek the nomination. However, some of those previously released polls show that when voters are informed that Donalds has been endorsed by President Donald Trump, his lead over DeSantis grows exponentially.
“Casey DeSantis was an early favorite when we asked about this in fall of 2023 with 22%, ahead of Donalds with 9%, and 40% undecided, but after Trump’s endorsement of Donalds and as we get closer to August 2026, DeSantis’s lead has all but disappeared, now inside the margin of error for this poll,” said Dr. Michael Binder, UNF PORL faculty director and professor of political science.
And Binder says among Republicans who voted in the 2022 primary election, Donalds is actually 15 points ahead of Mrs. DeSantis, “and it’s likely those same folks will be the ones voting next August, so this race might not actually be as close as it appears.”
Casey DeSantis has refused to say whether she’ll run for governor to succeed her husband, Ron DeSantis, when he is term limited out of office.
She has faced extensive negative media coverage this year regarding Hope Florida, an initiative she spearheaded that is designed to help Floridians move off government assistance by connecting them to a clearinghouse of services offered by nonprofits and faith-based communities. The Hope Florida Foundation, the nonprofit behind the program, has been under scrutiny for months following reports that it gave $10 million from a Medicaid settlement with a giant managed care plan to two nonprofits.
The nonprofits then directed the taxpayer dollars to a political committee, chaired by the governor’s then-chief of staff, to campaign against a proposed constitutional amendment that would have legalized recreational marijuana.
While the diversion of Medicaid money to lobby against the marijuana amendment made headlines throughout the 2025 session, it isn’t resonating with the GOP base. According to the survey, 63% of GOP respondents said that they had never heard of the Hope Florida Foundation, with 23% indicating a favorable opinion, and just 6% unfavorable.
“Two thirds of Florida Republicans have not heard of the Hope Florida Foundation, closely linked to a recent major scandal for the DeSantis camp,” said Dr. Sean Freeder, UNF professor of political science in a press release accompanying survey results. “While their lack of knowledge helps Casey DeSantis now, the Donalds campaign and others are sure to campaign on the scandal and, as Republican voters learn more, she’s likely to lose some support.”
The poll also shows that Florida Republicans generally support eliminating property taxes for homeowners (63%) and oppose a potential 2026 ballot measure legalizing recreational cannabis (58% oppose, with only 40% supporting).
The survey of 797 active Florida Republicans was conducted between July 14-22 with a margin of error of +/-3.9% by the Public Opinion Research Lab (PORL) at the University of North Florida.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Untitled-design-12-1024x538.png,,,2025-07-24 06:08:12.043064

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.
Trump’s deportations could cost 6M jobs, report finds

The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.










The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling. 


– Oregon Republican state Rep. Cyrus Javadi


Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.
If Trump wants more deportations, he’ll need to target the construction industry

Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.
More cities, counties join immigrant sanctuary lawsuit seeking to block Trump funding cuts

Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

(Getty Images)New Hampshire’s revenue picture in June showed a mix of encouraging and troubling signs, with the state collecting more money than expected for the month while still finishing the fiscal year well below last year’s totals, according to an analysis by the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute.
The state brought in $10 million more than the state revenue plan projected in June, but combined general fund and education trust fund revenues for fiscal year 2025, which ended June 30, still fell $201.7 million short of the prior year — a 6% decline. 
The early unaudited numbers offer a bit of cautious optimism that the state’s largest revenue stream, business taxes, may have bottomed out after a prolonged slide, though nagging shortfalls in other areas still speak to some of the volatility New Hampshire’s tax structure has seen in recent years.
“June revenues continue to suggest that the decline in business tax revenue may be ending,” Phil Sletten, research director at NHFPI and author of the analysis, told the Bulletin. “It’s not clear that business tax revenues are growing again robustly. However, the state experienced a significant decline in business tax revenues relative to expectations in the prior years over the last two years.”
June happens to matter for the state’s finances, with about 90% of businesses making second-quarter tax payments that month. Combined business tax receipts came in $5.5 million above target and $9.7 million ahead of last June, which serves as a bright spot after missing expectations in 15 of the past 24 months, according to Sletten’s calculations.
Cash-basis business tax revenues fell $121.1 million in fiscal 2025 versus fiscal 2024, part of a broader decline Sletten says likely stems from slower corporate profit growth and policy changes affecting how business tax liability is calculated for companies operating across multiple states, rather than recent rate cuts. NHFPI has previously posited that tax rate reductions since 2016 have cost the state between $800 million and $1.2 billion versus 2015 rates.
“The business tax volatility and growth in the business taxes has been a primary reason why we had four state budget cycles with significant surpluses and why state revenues were more constrained going into this (the 2026-2027 biennium) state budget cycle,” Sletten noted.
Other revenue sources such as the state’s vice industries struggled. Liquor Commission profits dropped $29.4 million below plan and $26.1 million under last year. June liquor revenues alone fell 44% below target, blamed on changing drinking habits and short-term weather impacts.
Tobacco tax collections also missed the mark by $31.7 million for the year as cigarette sales continued their long decline. Sletten pointed out that the revenue mix has shifted: Cigarettes now account for 86% of tobacco tax revenue, down from over 90% historically, as the share of e-cigarette taxes grows.
Additionally, June collections on the state’s real estate transfer tax fell 15% below plan as both transaction values and volume dropped, but full-year revenues still beat fiscal 2024 by 9%. According to Sletten, the difference there reflects interest rate whiplash and the skyrocketing cost of a median-priced home. The monthly mortgage jumped from $1,882 in 2019 to $3,957 in 2024 for the median New Hampshire home, assuming a 5% down payment and average 30-year fixed mortgage rates.
“Someone who might otherwise be thinking of selling their house may be looking at that higher monthly payment and saying, ‘I’m not going to sell this house’ instead,” Sletten said.
Interest earnings on the state’s cash reserves provided the biggest relative surprise to planned amounts for fiscal 2025, though that windfall faces pressure as the state spends down one-time federal American Rescue Plan Act dollars that must be used by 2026, according to Sletten. Higher interest rates have also helped, but those could reverse if the Federal Reserve decides to cut rates.
And the recent elimination of the interest and dividends tax continues to weigh on comparisons, with June alone losing $19.7 million from the tax’s absence. The levy, which existed since 1923 and carried a 5% rate from 1977 to 2022, generated $184.7 million in fiscal 2024 — 8.8% of general fund revenue that year. It was phased out starting in 2021 and eliminated entirely in the calendar year 2025.
“The interest and dividend tax not being there does affect the amount of services that can be funded,” Sletten said. “It also affects comparisons of year-over-year revenue to the general fund. And that’s why I flagged it in the analysis itself, because if you’re comparing year-over-year revenues, then you need to remember that there are also policy changes, not just sort of secular trends in the economy that are impacting what revenues look like.”
State officials will finalize fiscal 2025 numbers by December. Preliminary data shows $3.139 billion in total revenues for the general fund and the education trust fund, which is still short of the $3.165 billion target.
Sletten said final audited numbers will help inform revenue tracking under the new state budget and give insights for potential future adjustments to fund approved public services.
“This provided us with a little bit of insight, and that included the business tax revenues (that) may have finished their decline, but there’s still more to learn,” he said. “More data will tell us whether that is definitive or just a hint at this point.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/revenuejune-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-24 06:08:12.043064

(John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)A federal judge said Wednesday that he will decide “fairly soon” whether to block Arkansas’ first-in-the-nation law regulating pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs).
Act 624 of 2025 bans pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from holding a permit to operate a drug store in Arkansas after Jan. 1, 2026. PBMs negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers, and the biggest ones also own pharmacies and insurers.
The Federal Trade Commission released an interim report in July 2024 saying PBMs are eliminating competition and increasing drug prices at the expense of patients. The report also states three pharmacy benefit managers — OptumRx, Express Scripts and CVS Caremark — manage 79% of prescription drug insurance claims for approximately 270 million people.
All three PBMs, in addition to Navitus Health Solutions and the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA), filed four challenges to Act 624 between May and June. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas combined the four complaints into one case in which U.S. Judge Brian Miller heard arguments Wednesday.
The plaintiffs’ attorneys argued that Act 624 violates several aspects of the U.S. Constitution, including interfering with interstate commerce. Ryan Hale and Asher Steinberg of the Arkansas Attorney General’s office disputed the plaintiffs’ allegation that the state is engaging in “economic protectionism” and repeated lawmakers’ statements that Act 624 is meant to protect local businesses and Arkansans’ access to health care by “eliminating anticompetitive practices.”
Pharmacy benefit managers will have to pay Arkansas drugstores dispensing fees under new rule

Local independent pharmacists from throughout Arkansas have told state officials PBMs routinely break or skirt around Act 900 of 2015, which required pharmacy benefit managers to pay pharmacies at least the national average of what drugstores pay wholesalers for drugs.
Lawmakers and the Arkansas Pharmacists Association have claimed PBMs also routinely violate two 2018 laws that prohibit them from reimbursing their affiliated pharmacies in Arkansas at a higher rate than their locally owned competitors.
However, “the state has put nothing in front of the court to say these companies are violating the law in such a way that the additional law is needed to solve some regulatory stopgap,” plaintiffs’ attorney Jeffrey Wall told the court.
PCMA’s attorney, Michael Kimberly, argued that Act 624 is an unconstitutional bill of attainder, meaning it imposes a legislative punishment without due process. The revocation of a pharmacy license is “a kind of punishment that traditionally follows a hearing and an opportunity to present a defense,” but Act 624 does not allow for that, Kimberly said.
Hale said Act 624 is not a bill of attainder because it is for “non-punitive legislative purposes” and “operates prospectively, not retroactively.” 
Kimberly disagreed. “There’s a carve-out for PBMs that don’t meet the description of the PBMs the Legislature is attempting to punish, and the distinction is past conduct,” he said.
Act 624 exempts the state’s largest employer, Walmart, from the ban on PBMs owning pharmacy permits. The law does not mention Walmart by name, but it exempts any pharmacy that “exclusively services the employees and dependents of the pharmacy employer while utilizing the affiliated pharmacy benefits manager in this state.” The plaintiffs’ complaints argue this exemption is unfair.

The plaintiffs also claim Act 624 will restrict Arkansans’ access to mail-order and specialty pharmacy services, which are the only means of obtaining specific drugs. Express Scripts’ complaint states that Act 624 “imperils the health” of the 50,000 Arkansans it serves, including members of the military, their families and veterans because the PBM’s ESI Mail Pharmacy Inc. is the primary mail-order pharmacy provider for Tricare, the military’s health insurance program.
Daniel Volchok, Express Scripts’ attorney, said the PBM’s contract with the U.S. Department of Defense requires it to provide “uniform health care for service members.”
Act 624 allows the state pharmacy board to issue limited permits to PBMs if they provide “drugs that are otherwise unavailable in the market to a patient or a pharmacy that would otherwise be prohibited” under the law. Volchok said this provision is insufficient because it covers only a “subset” of medications approved by the Department of Defense for Tricare participants.
Third federal lawsuit challenges Arkansas’ restrictions on pharmacy benefit managers

“Even if the state board were to do the most it is authorized to do… that would not allow ESI to do everything it is required to do under the contract,” Volchok said.
Kimberly also emphasized Act 624’s projected impact on the pharmaceutical industry, specifically the “harm to goodwill, relationships, contractual arrangements and the destabilization of an entire business model.”
“I understand the harm it would do to the industry,” Miller said, but indicated injury to the PBMs wouldn’t be the deciding factor. 
“I have no problem at all, if I found the state of Arkansas went too far, to enjoin [the law],” he said.
If Miller enjoins Act 624, the case is expected to go to trial, with the plaintiffs seeking a permanent injunction on the basis of unconstitutionality.

(Photo by Emily Elconin/Getty Images)Amid recent political rhetoric about rising crime and violence in American cities, a new analysis shows that violent crime has continued to decline this year.
Homicides and several other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, dropped during the first half of 2025 across 42 U.S. cities, continuing a downward trend that began in 2022, according to a new crime trends report released Thursday by the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
Homicides fell 17% in the first half of 2025, compared with the same period in 2024, among the 30 cities that reported homicide data, according to the report.
During that same period, five cities saw increases in homicide — ranging from 6% in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to 39% in Little Rock, Arkansas.
While the report’s authors say the continued drop in violent crime — especially homicides — is encouraging, they note that much of the decline stems from a few major cities with historically high rates, such as Baltimore and St. Louis.
More than half of the cities studied have higher homicide rates than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, though, the analysis found that there were 14% fewer homicides during the first half of 2025 compared to the same period in 2019.
The authors say more research is needed before crediting any specific policy or practice for the continued drop in violent crime.
The group’s findings come as President Donald Trump continues to amplify concerns about crime, at times citing misleading statistics and narratives.
Most violent crime rates have fallen back to pre-pandemic levels, new report shows

In a Truth Social post earlier this week, Trump claimed that cashless bail — a practice that allows people charged with a crime to be released pretrial without paying money, unless a judge deems them a threat to public safety — were fueling a national crime surge and endangering law enforcement.
He wrote: “Crime in American Cities started to significantly rise when they went to CASHLESS BAIL. The WORST criminals are flooding our streets and endangering even our great law enforcement officers. It is a complete disaster, and must be ended, IMMEDIATELY!”
Some research suggests that setting money bail isn’t effective in ensuring court appearances or improving public safety. Opponents of ending cash bail often raise concerns that released suspects might commit new, potentially more serious crimes. While that is possible in individual cases, studies show that eliminating cash bail does not lead to a widespread increase in crime.
The Truth Social post also marked a sharp shift from Trump’s remarks during a June roundtable with the Fraternal Order of Police, where he claimed the national murder rate had “plummeted by 28%” since he took office — a figure that overstates the decline and overlooks the fact that murder rates began falling well before he returned to office.
According to data consulting firm AH Datalytics, which manages the Real-Time Crime Index — a free tool that collects crime data from more than 400 law enforcement agencies nationwide — the number of homicides between January and May 2025 was 20.3% lower than the same period in 2024.
Similarly, data released in May by the Major Cities Chiefs Association showed that homicides fell roughly 20% in the first quarter of 2025 compared with the first three months of the prior year. The group’s data is based on a survey of 68 major metropolitan police departments nationwide.
Researchers at the Council on Criminal Justice note in their report that it’s difficult to pinpoint a single reason for the drop in homicides, but they note that fewer people appear to be exposed to high-risk situations, such as robberies.
Most major crimes fell in the first half of 2025 compared with the same period last year, according to the council’s report.
Motor vehicle thefts dropped by 25%, while reported gun assaults fell 21%. Robberies, residential and non-residential burglaries, shoplifting, and aggravated and sexual assaults also saw double-digit declines
Drug offenses held steady, while domestic violence reports rose slightly — by about 3%. Carjackings declined 24% and larcenies were down 5%.
Compared with the first half of 2019, before the pandemic and nationwide reckoning over racial justice and policing, overall homicides are down 14%, robberies by 30%, and sexual assaults by 28%.
Still, more than 60% of the cities in the council’s study sample report homicide rates that remain above 2019 levels.
Motor vehicle theft remains the only crime tracked in the report that is still elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels — up 25% since 2019 — although it has declined sharply since 2023.
The council also released another analysis on the lethality of violent crime, showing that while violent incidents have decreased, the share of violence that ends in death has increased significantly. In 1994, there were 2 homicides per 1,000 assaults and about 16 per 1,000 robberies. By 2020, those figures rose to 7.2 and 55.8, respectively.

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Earlier this week, Ohio lawmakers scrapped summer plans to take action on property taxes.
“We really need to do something,” State Rep. Bill Roemer, R-Richfield insisted. “We need to fix property taxes in Ohio.”
The state’s tax rates rank 8th in the country, he argued, ahead of New York, California and Florida, not to mention every one of Ohio’s neighboring states.
So why did lawmakers flinch?
Instead of overriding three property tax measures vetoed by the governor, they took up just one. It’s a provision limiting the sort of local levies that can put before voters in the future, but it makes no changes to homeowners’ current bills. The problem — and lawmakers from both parties acknowledge it — is homeowners are very much concerned about their taxes in the here and now.
Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman chalked it up to bad luck. Some lawmakers are out of town. Others got what he claimed was “bad information” from local officials.
“And so, you know, we should have done these two (other) things,” he explained. “But some of our folks needed more time to figure out what exactly it was that the locals were saying.”
The two remaining provisions, one granting county budget commissions more power and the other rejiggering a formula to lower taxes at the expense of school districts, could still come up for a vote when lawmakers return to work in October.

But a lot can happen between now and then.
Later today (Thursday), a task force organized by Gov. Mike DeWine holds its first meeting. He’s giving them until the end of September to produce concrete recommendations that will make a “meaningful” difference for homeowners.
In the meantime, ordinary Ohioans and even some lawmakers are looking to the ballot box, arguing the current system is irretrievably broken.
“For my money,” grassroots organizer Beth Blackmarr said, “the way to do this is a complete do-over.”

“At a boil”
At the Warren County Fair last week, Joy Broedling was working the room — chatting up families retreating indoors to cool off between rides. She had a clipboard collecting signatures for a constitutional amendment outright abolishing property taxes. In Broedling’s telling, plenty of people were ready to sign.
“They can’t afford it anymore, and it’s never ending,” she said. “Warren County, where you are right now, they’re going to have another 25% increase in January. What can we do? The officials are not representing us, so the grassroots is the only way.”
One of her takers was Steven Suever, who came down to the fair from Kettering.
“Personally, I think that a lot of our municipalities go way overboard,” he said. “They build a fire station; it’s a Taj Mahal.”
“I want good services,” he added, but argued agencies need to live within their means just like he does.
Ohio property tax repeal campaign preparing to collect signatures

Carol McIntosh from Morrow, said her property taxes have doubled in seven years. After signing, she explained her family is restoring an abandoned 220-year-old home. Property taxes typically rise to reflect improvements like renovations, but McIntosh questions that arrangement.
“It was a decrepit old house, it was an eyesore for the county, for the city,” she explained. “So, we buy it, and we’re fixing it. We’re bringing it back to glory, and we’re being punished by our property taxes going through the ceiling as we make improvements.”
McIntosh complained an old outhouse is getting treated as an additional structure. “It’s just there because it’s nostalgic,” she said.
Citizens for Property Tax Reform spokeswoman Beth Blackmarr argued repeatedly that people are “at a boil.” She highlighted counties like Mahoning that are seeing double-digit delinquency rates and scoffed at lawmakers’ recent efforts.
“Some of the moves that they’re making are a day late (and) a dollar short, really,” she said. “I mean, this should have been done 20 years ago in order to make a difference for the people who are being pushed out of their homes now.”
She said the campaign is “going gangbusters” but declined to share information about how many signatures they’ve collected.
Citizens for Property Tax Reform missed the deadline to make this year’s ballot, but Blackmarr said that was always a bit of a Hail Mary anyway.

“We’re not doing enough”
Abolishing property taxes in the state constitution carries enormous consequences. Even if you believe Ohio’s rates are too high, no state in the country has abandoned property taxes.
According to the Department of Taxation, Ohio counties collected $18.5 billion in property taxes in 2023. For context, that’s about double what Ohioans paid in income taxes that year and a billion more than they paid in sales taxes.
No problem, Blackmarr and some of the amendment’s supporters argue: Back lawmakers into a corner, and they’ll figure out how to bridge that gap. But would supermajority Republican lawmakers in Ohio back a tax increase to make up the difference?
State Reps. Tex Fischer, R-Boardman and Beth Lear, R-Delaware, are hoping it doesn’t come to that. They’re working on an amendment that would cap property taxes at 1.25% of a home’s total value for ordinary Ohioans and 1% for seniors who have been in their home at least five years.
“The people of Ohio are demanding action,” Fischer said, “and we’re not doing enough at the state level.”
Fischer sees the citizen-led initiative gathering steam, and he believes they’ll get the signatures they need to make the ballot. He thinks it will pass if lawmakers don’t do “something drastic” in the meantime.
Fischer’s current tax rate comes out to about 1.8%, but in faster growing areas of the state, he said, taxes can creep up to 3%. The state caps other taxes levied at the local level, Fischer argued, and doing the same for property taxes is “one option” voters could consider.
Ohio House votes to override one, not three, of Gov. DeWine’s property tax vetoes

One person who might bite? House Speaker Matt Huffman. Following the override vote, the speaker repeatedly referenced California, which limits annual property tax increases to 2%.
“We should have an absolute limit inflation-wise, much like California does,” Huffman said. “California is the state to look to when it comes to real estate tax.”
Even if Fischer and Lear can get their proposal on the ballot — they’ll need support from three-fifths of members in both chambers of the General Assembly to do so — Fischer acknowledged voters might do away with property taxes anyway.
“And I certainly understand where they’re coming from,” he said. “I think the longer we continue to not act, the more likely that that outcome is.”

A “complimentary” mission
On the other hand, former state lawmaker Bill Seitz is skeptical of the effort to repeal property taxes. DeWine tapped the long-serving Cincinnati Republican to co-chair his property tax reform working group.
“I will not be surprised if they get enough signatures to put it on the ballot,” Seitz said of the repeal effort. “But I would be shocked if it passed.”
Seitz brought up two points of reference.
In the 1970s, “because I’m old enough to remember this,” he said, Democrats held sway in Ohio, and they instituted the state’s first income tax. Conservatives in the state tried to get rid of it — twice — and failed both times.
More recently, Republican lawmakers passed Ohio Senate Bill 5, eliminating collective bargaining for public sector unions, only to see voters repeal the measure easily.
In the voting booth, Seitz argued, Ohioans cast their ballots to protect public services each time.
“Once the people are educated to the fact that an abolition of the property tax in Ohio would create a $23 billion hole in the provision of local services?” he asked. “I think most rational people will get over their anger over current high property tax rates and realize that we can’t just throw the baby out with the bath water here.”
Still, the working group could face an uphill climb convincing lawmakers and citizens to take it seriously.
Huffman complained he hasn’t gotten a straight answer about what happens if they come up with proposals the governor doesn’t like. Many others, inside government and out, have pointed to a joint committee on property tax reform that produced an 800-plus page report just last year.
Seitz said that’s a good start and framed the working group’s mission as “complimentary” to that effort.
“They’re mostly good recommendations, but they weren’t prioritized,” he said. “By their own admission, some of them were contradictory to one another, and none of them were reduced to anything resembling legislative form.”
Seitz added the working group might also work on tweaks to some the provisions DeWine previously vetoed.
One of those measures gives county budget commissions the authority to reduce or eliminate voted levies if they’re “unnecessary, excessive or unneeded.”
Seitz argued none of those terms are defined, and there’s no timeframe which could give local officials an opening to overturn a levy a few months after voters approved it.
“That’s not a huge change,” Seitz said, “it just requires some more work.”
Should Ohioans buck history and vote to repeal property taxes, Seitz doesn’t envy the lawmakers tasked with cleaning up the mess.
At 10%, Louisiana has the highest sales taxes in the country. Seitz has heard Ohio would need a sales tax rate of 15-20% to replace $23 billion in lost revenue.
“And by the way that would be very stupid,” he added, noting residents like him who live near the state border would just take their purchases elsewhere.
And after bragging about cutting state income taxes to a flat 2.75%, Seitz said, Republican lawmakers would be loath to reverse course.
Good tax policy works as a three-legged stool, he said, combining property tax, income tax, and sales tax.
“The three of them tend to counterbalance each other and provide a reliable source of revenue to fund basic state and local services,” he said. “I still believe that. Whether we can convince the public of that, that remains to be seen.”

Getty Images.	Ohio lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have introduced several LGBTQ-related bills so far this General Assembly.
Republicans have put forth a drag ban bill, a piece of legislation that would make it harder for a student to use a different name or pronoun at school, and a bill requiring transgender political candidates to list their deadname, among others. 
On the other side of the aisle, Democrats have introduced the Ohio Fairness Act and a bill that would ban conversion therapy.
Lawmakers passed several anti-LGBTQ bills that became law during the last General Assembly — including prohibiting gender affirming care to transgender youth, blocking trans athletes from playing on teams that align with their identity, a transgender school bathroom ban, and requiring educators to out a students’ sexuality to their parents.
An Ohio court partially overturned a ban on gender-affirming care for LGBTQ youth earlier this year, meaning doctors can still prescribe puberty blockers and hormone therapy.
Anti-LGBTQ bills 
Ohio House Bill 249 would ban drag performers from performing anywhere that is not a designated adult entertainment facility. State Reps. Angie King, R-Celina, and Josh Williams, R-Sylvania Twp., introduced the bill, which has had sponsor testimony.  
This is a re-introduction of a bill from the previous General Assembly that did not make it out of committee and faced much opposition. 
Ohio House Bill 190 would require parental permission for schools to use different pronouns or different names for students that don’t match up with the biological sex or birth name. 
Williams and state Rep. Johnathan Newman, R-Troy, introduced the bill, which has had sponsor testimony.  
Ohio House Bill 172  would ban children 14 and older from receiving mental health services without parental consent. Newman also introduced this bill, which has had sponsor testimony. 
Ohio House Bill 196 would require political candidates to list their former names on candidacy petitions. This, however, would not apply to names that have been changed due to marriage. King and state Reps Rodney Creech, R-West Alexandria, introduced the bill, which has had sponsor testimony. 
Three transgender candidates filed to run for state office in Ohio last year, but encountered challenges over the names they put on their paperwork. 
The ACLU is tracking nearly 600 anti-LGBTQ bills nationwide.
Ohio House Bill 262 would designate the weeks from Mother’s Day to Father’s Day as Natural Family Month. Williams and state Rep. Beth Lear, R-Galena, introduced the bill, which has had sponsor and opponent testimony. 
Pro-LGBTQ bills 
Ohio Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood, has introduced a few bills that support LGBTQ people. Antonio is the only openly gay lawmaker in the Ohio General Assembly. 
Ohio Senate Bill 70, also known as the Ohio Fairness Act, would expand anti-discrimination laws to include sexual orientation and gender identity. House Bill 136 is a companion bill. 
Antonio has introduced the Ohio Fairness Act in every General Assembly since she was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives in 2011 and this is the first time since 2018 the bill has no Republican support.
Ohio Senate Bill 71 would ban any licensed health professionals from doing conversion therapy when providing mental health treatment to minors. Antonio and state Sen. Beth Liston, D-Dublin, introduced the bill. House Bill 300 is a companion bill. 
Ohio Senate Bill 211 would designate the first full week of June as “Love Makes a Family Week.” Antonio introduced this bill as well. 
None of these bills have had any hearings so far this General Assembly. Ohio lawmakers are on summer break and will come back to the Statehouse this fall.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio House Republicans are considering overriding Gov. Mike DeWine’s veto of a provision that requires public libraries to hide content related to sexual orientation or gender identity.
That possible change has been met with resistance by some librarians.
Danielle Welling-Harris with the Cuyahoga Falls Library, says the library wants everyone to find a book that fits them.
“Libraries exist for everyone,” she said, adding, “Just means so much to people to see themselves reflected in the pages of the story.”
Welling-Harris said she was relieved when DeWine vetoed a provision in the state operating budget — one that would have required public libraries to place books referencing “sexual orientation or gender” in an area away from the public.
“We don’t want to live in a library where materials are separated for something as simple as mentioning Little Women,” she said. “That’s a classic, but it mentions gender.”
But even after the governor shut the provision down, she fears her display will need to stay up.
House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, called lawmakers back from summer recess on Monday to override one school-related veto that would restrict emergency, substitute and requests for increases on current levies. Some GOP lawmakers say it will, eventually, give property tax relief.
It isn’t the only override Huffman had his eye on.
“One of the things that’s been brought to my attention is… the library, adult materials and children’s portions of libraries,” Huffman said Monday.
Another provision he wants to override would have allowed counties to take money away from schools, and another would have changed state funding calculations.
“I expect we will take veto overrides on those two and likely some others also,” Huffman said.
State Rep. Gary Click, R-Vickery, is pushing the LGBTQ+ override and accuses libraries of indoctrinating children with LGBTQ+ content, specifically material around transgender people.
“They’re answering questions for our kids that our kids are not asking,” Click claimed.
A family shouldn’t have to have “helicopter parents” to prevent their kids from seeing this type of content, he said.
“What we’re talking about is sexual content, where we’re talking about trans or gender dysphoria,” Click said.
Other possible overrides include provisions that would have stopped giving tax breaks to computer data centers and one that would have prevented state and local governments from using eminent domain to obtain property for the construction of recreational trails.
Click said the library books are the most important.
“If a parent wants the children to have this, they can either go buy it or they go to the adult section and get it, and they can do that,” he said.
He said that the Cuyahoga Falls Library saying it will need to hide content with pronouns on the cover is “foolish.”
Welling-Harris disagreed because the provision is vague and said that libraries are not indoctrinating children by showing different identities.
“We are creating collections that are reflective of the real people that exist in our community,” she said. “That’s the reality of the world that we live in and, so we are here to provide options and to ensure that everyone sees themselves on our shelves and that our collection reflects the community that we live in.”
She also said that libraries already follow Ohio’s obscenity laws.
“We have procedures for our residents to voice concerns about library materials in their community, and that process is in place and working well,” she said.
The lawmakers will likely attempt their overrides before the law goes into effect at the end of September. But, they have until the end of 2026 to override.

(Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Consumers in a 13-state region that includes Ohio could see their electric bills rise another 1.5% to 5% starting in the summer of 2026, after a key electricity auction cleared at its maximum price Tuesday.
PJM Interconnection, the regional electric grid operator serving Maryland, uses the competitive auction process to procure electric capacity from generators. The auction’s clearing price generally trickles down to consumers, as one segment of their utility bill.
And this year’s auction cleared at a record-high price for the second year in a row. It would have soared even higher, if it weren’t for a cap instituted by PJM at the request of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D), which was backed by Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D).
The clearing price equalled the cap, set at $329.17 per megawatt-day. Without the ceiling, PJM estimates it would have reached $388.57 per megawatt-day.
This year’s auction means that consumers will pay a total of $16.1 billion for electricity capacity during a one-year period that begins in June 2026. The previous auction cleared at a record $14.7 billion, an unprecedented increase compared to the year before, when the auction closed at $2.2 billion.
What drove that historic increase? PJM says that an increase in energy demand, chiefly from data centers, was to blame, alongside reductions in energy supply as old fossil fuel power plants retire.
Ohioans’ electric bills could climb depending on regional grid auction

For 2026, power demand in the PJM grid is projected to increase by 5,400 megawatts, with data centers causing a “majority” of the jump, said Stu Bresler, PJM’s executive vice president of market services and strategy.
But Bresler said that PJM saw an “encouraging” increase in the amount of new power generation in this auction, for the first time in the past four auctions. Several generators also reversed plans to retire, instead bidding on the auction.
“We’re pleased to see the reversals of retirements because that’s the kind of thing we need, ” Bresler said.
The auction resulted in an energy mix that is 45% natural gas, 21% nuclear, 22% coal, 4% hydropower, 3% wind and 1% solar.
In addition to the implementation of the cap, this year’s auction also included a policy change with a “significant” impact for the Baltimore area, Bresler said.
This year, PJM included the electric capacity that will be generated by Anne Arundel County’s Brandon Shores coal plant and the H.A. Wagner oil plant, which were both compelled to stay online beyond their planned closure dates because of concerns about power supply. PJM decided to change its policy of excluding those resources from the auction after outcry from ratepayer advocates, including Maryland’s Office of the People’s Counsel.
The Maryland OPC has estimated that the 2024 exclusion cost PJM customers as much as $5 billion, and has asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to return that money to consumers.
Last year, partially because of the Brandon Shores issue, the Baltimore Gas & Electric territory saw a higher auction clearing price than the rest of the PJM territory: about $466 per megawatt-day. This time, the auction clearing price was the same for all utilities in the PJM territory.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But Bresler said Tuesday that BGE ratepayers aren’t likely to see rates go down as a result of this year’s lower auction price. That’s because last BGE received a credit (for importing power from lower-priced regions) which lowered the actual clearing price to about $305 per megawatt-day. So this year’s $329 price would still be an increase for BGE customers.
For some Maryland politicians, the 2024 auction was a gut-check, and it was part of the reason that leading lawmakers opted to pursue energy legislation this year, passing a package of bills dedicated largely to bolstering power supply by hastening new projects. Legislators were also spurred to action by consumers’ high natural gas bills, which peaked in the cold winter months as lawmakers convened in Annapolis.
The bill increases from the 2024 auction will take effect at different times for Maryland customers, depending on their utility territory. Pepco and Delmarva Power customers will see increases in August, Potomac Edison customers will face increases in October and BGE customers will see increases this fall, before rate decrease for the colder winter months. SMECO customers saw the rate increase beginning in June.
Ratepayer advocates have argued that the auction cost isn’t increasing solely due to supply and demand, but due to policies at PJM. They’ve cited a backlog in PJM’s queue for new power generation to come online, particularly renewable energy projects.
PJM has countered that, within 18 months, it expects to clear the bottleneck in the queue, which was engineered in an era of large power plants, as opposed to a wider array of smaller projects featuring wind turbines, solar panels, battery storage and other technologies.
PJM has also created a one-time fast-track for 51 “shovel-ready” energy projects to connect to the grid by 2031, which includes two projects in Maryland.

Jerry Moran abandoned his commitment to Medicaid and voted to strip thousands of Kansans of their health care. Kansans deserve a senator who will fight for them, writes Mary Jones. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)In April, U.S. Sen Jerry Moran stood up for Medicaid on the Senate floor, arguing that KanCare provides our rural communities with their only source of preventative care, family medicine and mental health support.
This month, he turned his back on Kansans and abandoned his commitment to Medicaid, choosing to vote for a bill that would strip health care from thousands across the state.
Now come the consequences.
KanCare is the cornerstone of our state’s medical system, providing vital health care to more than 366,000 Kansans, including one in every three children. It supplies essential funding for rural hospitals statewide, contributed to a 15% drop in overdose deaths in 2024 alone, delivers critical support for Kansans facing mental health challenges and allows more than 13,000 Kansas veterans to access medical services.
Medicaid is a major provider of mental health care in Kansas. Of those enrolled in KanCare, 30% have a mental health illness or addiction. Rural hospitals and community health programs are a lifeline for Kansans and often the only option for mental health support in these communities. More than half of Kansas rural hospitals are already at risk of closure; slashing KanCare could shutter as many as 65 rural hospitals across our state, leaving Kansans without access to basic care — including for mental health.
In Kansas, we look out for each other. But these Medicaid cuts leave our neighbors behind: veterans fighting PTSD, farmers struggling with depression and young people caught in the opioid crisis. This isn’t just policy for us. It’s about our neighbors, our communities.
Moran may try to justify his vote by saying that it will reduce spending, but that’s not true.
In reality, cuts to KanCare will strip more than 20,000 of our neighbors of their health insurance, forcing them to shoulder average out-of-pocket ER bills of $1,232. It will completely defund the Veterans Crisis Line that Moran, chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, once fought to improve. Cuts to Medicaid will lead to fewer Kansans getting access to the care they need, raise medical costs for everyone, and threaten our state’s economy. It will shrink our state’s GDP by billions and eliminate thousands of jobs across our state, most in the health care sector.
As the head of Mental Health America of South Central Kansas, I’ve seen firsthand the effect that KanCare has on providing affordable and quality mental health care to thousands of Kansans. I have dedicated my 30-year career to developing community-based programs for individuals with mental illness, including programming for substance use disorder treatment in our state. I know what KanCare means for our communities, and I know exactly what we stand to lose.
Cuts to this program are going to devastate families already struggling to find support.
I’ve seen it firsthand: a young farmer battling severe depression accessed consistent therapy and medication through Medicaid that literally saved his life during a drought that nearly wiped out his livelihood. We have served veterans in our area with PTSD who depend entirely on Medicaid-funded counseling services. And I think of a 10-year-old girl diagnosed with severe anxiety; thanks to Medicaid, she now receives the mental health care she needs and is thriving in school.
Without this safety net, thousands will be left without treatment, isolated and at risk. Medicaid is not optional in Kansas. It’s essential.
Here’s the bottom line: Cutting Medicaid puts politics over people. It jeopardizes the health of our friends and neighbors, our children and grandparents, our veterans and farmers.
Moran has stood up for Medicaid at home and in Washington, raising concerns about this bill and its devastating impact on Kansans. But instead of acting when it counted, he turned his back on us. Medicaid cuts won’t go into effect until 2026, which means lawmakers still have the opportunity to change course.
Kansans deserve better than health care cuts. Kansans deserve KanCare, and we deserve a senator who fights for us.

Mayhew, The Ohio State University; Anisha Gill-Morris, The Ohio State University; Hind Haddad, The Ohio State University, and Renee L. Bowling, The Ohio State University
In spring 2024, pro-Palestinian student encampments that began at Columbia and Harvard spread to university campuses throughout the U.S. as Israel invaded Gaza in response to Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, surprise attack. At least 100 campuses had encampments for at least a few days during this period.
While some campuses erupted in violence, others remained peaceful and didn’t experience the open conflict that led to congressional hearings, university presidents losing their jobs and repercussions that are continuing to be felt today.
What made the difference?
In spring 2024, Ohio State University’s College Impact Laboratory, where we all work, surveyed universities to learn more about whether their campuses experienced protests, what happened and how they handled them. Part of our goal was to understand how spiritual leaders played a role, if any, in managing the protests. We’ve been analyzing the data ever since. The results from those who responded point to several lessons universities could learn from to avoid violence in future protests.
 Campuses are a critical arena for activism

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Campus protests have long been a defining feature of social and political change in the U.S. From the civil rights movements of the 1950s and 1960s to the student-led climate strikes of recent years, higher education institutions have served as a critical space for activism.
Often, these protests reflect broader societal tensions, and how universities respond has played a significant role in shaping their outcomes.
Historically, protests have been most likely to escalate when students feel unheard. In contrast, institutions that adopt proactive strategies, such as facilitating conversations or including students in decision-making, often experience better outcomes.
 Snapshot of the pro-Palestinian protests

As our survey data shows, the pro-Palestinian protests illustrate this dynamic.
To gather data, the College Impact Laboratory sent questionnaires to administrators at the 329 universities that participate in our Interfaith Spiritual, Religious and Secular Campus Climate Index, also known as the INSPIRES Index, as well as hundreds of colleges and universities in our recruitment database.
In all, 35 schools responded to our 23-question survey. Of those, we found that most protests were led by students, half lasted less than a week, and the vast majority were nonviolent. Fifteen did not have protests, while the rest did. While the number of institutions that participated in this survey is relatively small, it does give us key insights into what schools were thinking.
Half of the campuses with protests reported law enforcement involvement – either campus police or city officers – with 20% experiencing physical altercations between protesters and police. Other disruptive actions such as academic interruptions, vandalism, physical violence and doxxing were reported with varying frequencies.
Protests at campuses that participated in our survey peaked during April and May 2024, with 70% of them experiencing demonstrations in these months.
Here are three takeaways from the survey, suggesting steps universities can take before and during future protests to avoid escalation:
 1. Involve students in guidelines for engagement – early

At every surveyed institution that reported protests, students were at the forefront of organizing and leading these efforts.
Yet, despite this clear student leadership, about one-third of institutions said they didn’t consult with students to establish guidelines for engagement. Those that did invited representatives from student organizations or student government officers into the policymaking process to determine what protocols would be followed to manage protests and keep them peaceful.
On campuses where administrators didn’t engage with student leaders, tensions tended to escalate, and protests disrupted the institutions for weeks, often after police were called in or curfews were imposed.
While many of the protests lasted only one to seven days, we found that institutions that opened lines of communication early between administration and student protest leaders were more likely to deescalate tensions quickly. In contrast, campuses where administrators did not engage early on saw protests lasting weeks or involving greater disruptions.
Also, institutions that engaged early with student leaders were less likely to face stronger demands, such as calls for administrators to be fired, divestment from Israeli companies or calls to defund the campus police.
Our survey results suggest it’s important for administrators to engage with students early to establish clear guidelines to make it less likely future protests spiral into violence.
 2. Communicate openly, often and before protests

Discussion of difficult topics, such as the conflict between Israel and Palestinians, shouldn’t wait until protests break out to begin. We found that every school in our survey that proactively supported dialogue between Jews and Muslims – before the war broke out – didn’t see violence result from the protests.
Dialogue isn’t just a strategy for preventing protests from spiraling out of control; it is fundamental to intergroup learning in higher education. These events create safe spaces for students − whether Arab, Jewish, Palestinian or members of different ethnic or religious groups − to engage with classmates with different points of view.
But even once protests begin, dialogue can help. When institutions engaged in dialogue, during or as a result of a protest, the protests were less likely to involve violence. At half of the campuses that participated in our survey and experienced protests, protests were ended peacefully through dialogue.
Brown, for example, modeled the power of institutional listening in its response to its April 2024 encampment. Rather than escalating tensions, university leaders engaged directly with student activists, resulting in a peaceful resolution and a commitment to bring the students’ divestment proposal to a formal vote in October. It ultimately failed to pass the board of directors.
 3. Involve relevant groups in decision-making

Most administrators in our survey, as they considered how to engage with protesters, reached out to relevant student groups such as those that focus on Jewish and Muslim students to better understand their perspectives.
However, only 28% consulted a religious or spiritual life office staff member on campus.
Religious or spiritual life staff are present on both private and public campuses and may include university-employed multifaith chaplains, interfaith coordinators or directors of spiritual life. Unlike student-led religious groups, these professionals often serve as liaisons to the religious and nonreligious communities represented on campus.
The focus of such roles on serving students from all worldviews positions them as key resources for deescalation through community outreach, support and two-way communication. Additionally, these professionals have valuable expertise in religious pluralism and community relationships. This experience helps them to advise administrators on policy and potential courses of action in times of tension.
Consulting with university staff with a focus on religion or spiritual life makes particular sense given the nature of the protests and how religion is intertwined, but our data suggests they may be underutilized more broadly for their expertise in navigating tensions related to competing worldviews.
Proactive engagement with these leaders not only helps campuses navigate an immediate crisis but demonstrates a commitment to inclusivity and respect for different groups’ perspectives.
 Leading by example

Put another way, our research suggests institutions can avoid the negative outcomes of protests by embodying the traits commonly associated with universities, such as showing mutual respect, fostering democratic debate and engaging in critical thinking even on divisive issues. Engaging from a mindset of goodwill with student leaders shows administrators value student voices and are willing to work collaboratively toward solutions.
But when campuses ignore peaceful protests or refuse to engage with student leaders, they risk turning manageable situations into prolonged crises.
At a time when divisions run deep, we believe campuses that lead by example by embracing dialogue and engaging student activists before, during and after protests take place are not only likely to see less violence, but are likely to help heal America’s great divides.

Worried about large numbers of workers without a nest egg, Nevada this month launched a new retirement program for private sector workers who lack access to one.
The program requires employers with six or more employees to participate — unless they already sponsor an employee retirement plan.
Employees, who can opt out, are automatically enrolled in an Individual Retirement Account, or IRA, through regular paycheck deductions.
Nevada State Treasurer Zach Conine hopes the new program, created by lawmakers in 2023, will boost financial literacy and ultimately reduce state costs on social services as more people save for retirement. He said about 500,000 workers were expected to be eligible under the plan — nearly a third of the state’s civilian labor force of 1.68 million.
“We don’t care broadly if someone stays on the Nevada plan or goes out and gets their own retirement savings plan,” said Conine, a Democrat who is running for state attorney general. “We care that people are saving for retirement.”
New tax cuts mostly favor the rich across states this year

Nevada is among a growing number of states creating automatic retirement programs for employees of private employers. These programs, known as auto-IRAs, target employees without access to retirement programs through work, aiming to address what groups such as AARP characterize as a national retirement crisis.
So far, 20 states have created retirement programs for private sector workers, according to the Center for Retirement Initiatives at Georgetown University. Those programs are generally overseen by state treasurers and appointed boards. Private contractors administer the investment funds, which can fluctuate with financial markets.
AARP says more than 1 million Americans have enrolled in auto-IRA programs launched by states in recent years. But the group, which advocates for Americans aged 50 and older, says nearly half of private sector workers — 56 million people — still lack access to a retirement plan through work.
“In the long term, this is a problem we need to deal with. But in the short term for those individuals, this is a real crisis,” said David John, senior policy adviser at the AARP Public Policy Institute. “This is something that they are going to be facing soon, and our goal is to make sure that as younger people come along, they are much better prepared than some of the people who went before them.”
While anyone can open a savings or investment account, workers are far more likely to participate in retirement programs funded through simple payroll deductions, John said. And state auto-IRAs require little effort from employees and employers.
“Yes, anyone can go to a financial institution and open an IRA. But the bottom line is, they don’t,” he said.
Unlike state pension programs for public workers including teachers, these auto-IRAs are the sole possession of the worker. That means they are portable, and employees can even rely on those funds for emergency expenses at times, John said.
Some financial services firms have objected to these programs, arguing that they compete with private sector retirement providers.
So far, more liberal states have led the way on auto-IRA programs: Oregon launched the nation’s first in 2017, quickly followed by Illinois and California. But John said there’s growing interest in more conservative states: Nevada’s legislation was sponsored by Democrats, but ultimately signed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo.
“This is not a partisan political issue,” John said. “We are seeing strong interest in a number of red states.”
 Launching new programs

In launching its new auto-IRA, Nevada elected to join an interstate consortium of public auto-IRA plans founded by the Colorado Department of the Treasury. By pooling resources and reducing overhead costs, officials say states can offer lower plan fees to savers.
“Relatively, it’s a lot of work to set one of these things up, but it’s a lot less work if you’re not first,” Conine said.
The Nevada treasurer’s office expected the launch of the program to cost about $1.2 million over two fiscal years — funds that were borrowed from the state and are to be paid back through the collection of retirement participant fees over time.
Colorado Treasurer Dave Young sees the state’s retirement program as both a social and financial cause: It helps workers save for a more dignified retirement and keeps the state from spending more on services in the long run, he said.
“If we don’t take this on and get more people saving for retirement, there’s this massive tax bill awaiting taxpayers to fund safety net services, and why would we do that to our taxpayers?” said Young, a Democrat. “Why not change the trajectory for people? It’s relatively actually a simple solution.”
Red states fight growing efforts to give ‘basic income’ cash to residents

A 2023 report from payroll and benefits company Gusto found the biggest boost in participation came among Coloradans earning the least. Before the mandate, 10% of employees earning $15,000 to $25,000 per year participated in a retirement plan — a share that nearly doubled to 19% afterward.
Gusto also found more small employers started offering 401(k) plans after the state’s program launched in 2022.
Colorado has signed up about 72,000 workers with more than $100 million in savings. About 20% of eligible employees choose to opt out, said Hunter Railey, executive director of the Colorado retirement program.
The state program requires all employers in operation at least two years with five or more employees to participate or offer their own retirement plan.
Railey said it’s an easy process to sign up employers and workers, though an initial challenge was identifying the state’s smallest employers. The state used its unemployment system database and explains the program requirement directly to businesses.
“The final step there is really just communicating effectively that these are required programs, and that failure to comply with this does carry penalties at some point,” Railey said. “…By and large, we found that most if not the overwhelming majority of businesses, if they receive a notice for their business, are going to take action.”
Pennsylvania State Treasurer Stacy Garrity, a Republican, has advocated for a state auto-IRA program. Legislation creating a program passed the Democratic-controlled state House by a single vote along party lines and now awaits action in the Republican-controlled state Senate.
Garrity, who also leads the National Association of State Treasurers’ retirement and pensions committee, said an auto-IRA plan would benefit Pennsylvania businesses, workers and taxpayers.
“These are people we all depend on every day, like the mechanic who keeps our car running and the waitress that tops off our coffee,” she said in a statement to Stateline. “Two million hardworking Pennsylvanians without access to workplace retirement plans deserve to have the same opportunity to save.”
 The opposition

While state retirement programs are growing, they have faced industry opposition.
State chapters of the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents 600,000 small businesses across the country, have opposed some measures. In Pennsylvania, the federation said 84% of surveyed members opposed creation of an auto-IRA, arguing not all employees could afford to invest in retirement and that the new plans imposed too heavy a burden on small businesses.
The organization did not respond to requests for comment.
The National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors, which represents financial services providers in every state, says states should encourage private-sector options rather than setting up competing programs.










If we don't take this on and get more people saving for retirement, there's this massive tax bill awaiting taxpayers to fund safety net services, and why would we do that to our taxpayers?


– Colorado State Treasurer Dave Young


In a statement, Kevin Mayeux, CEO of the association, said access isn’t the only barrier to retirement savings. Many Americans, especially lower-income workers, must balance retirement savings against competing financial priorities including child care and rising costs of living.
The organization said it supports states’ interest in retirement savings, but that lawmakers should focus on private-sector options. Those could include multiple employer plans and pooled employer plans that make it easier for small employers to offer retirement plans at competitive rates.
“In short, NAIFA does not oppose efforts to improve retirement security; we welcome them,” Mayeux’s statement to Stateline said. “But we believe that empowering private-sector solutions, not replacing them with state-run programs, is the path to long-term success.”
But early success among participating states is inspiring more adoption, said Angela Antonelli, a research professor and executive director of the Center for Retirement Initiatives at Georgetown University.
In addition to amassing more than $2 billion in savings for workers, the state programs have encouraged employers to offer their own retirement plans, Antonelli said.
“It’s a huge return on the investment. It’s money well spent,” she said.
Antonelli said many participating workers are younger and will likely move into other jobs or careers over time. The hope is they will continue saving, either through the state-sponsored plans or retirement plans offered by future employers.
While she’s encouraged by the growing interest and adoption of these plans, Antonelli said she hopes to see Congress eventually act by requiring employers to offer retirement plans. A bipartisan group of U.S. House lawmakers reintroduced legislation on the matter in Washington this year, but it has not progressed.
“The goal is to have more states adopt these programs,” she said. “And I think the question is, is there a tipping point at which the federal government will now decide to step in?”

State lawmakers across the country filed more bills to restrict or protect libraries and readers in the first half of this year than last year, a new report found.
The split fell largely along geographic lines, according to the report from EveryLibrary, a group that advocates against book bans and censorship.
Between January and July 2025, lawmakers introduced 133 bills that the organization deemed harmful to libraries, librarians or readers’ rights in 33 states — an increase from 121 bills in all of 2024. Fourteen of those measures had passed as of mid-July.
At the same time, legislators introduced 76 bills in 32 states to protect library services or affirm the right to read, the report found.
The geographic split among these policies is stark.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In Southern and Plains states, new laws increasingly criminalize certain actions of librarians, restrict access to materials about gender and race, and transfer decision-making power to politically appointed boards or parent-led councils.
Texas alone passed a trio of sweeping laws stripping educators of certain legal protections when providing potentially obscene materials; banning public funding for instructional materials containing obscene content; and giving parents more authority over student reading choices and new library additions.
Tennessee lowered the bar to prosecute educators for sharing books that might be considered “harmful to minors.”
A New Hampshire bill likewise would’ve made it easier for parents or the state attorney general to bring civil actions against school employees for distributing material deemed harmful to minors, but it was vetoed by Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte.
In Nebraska, a new law allows for real-time alerts for parents every time a student checks out a book. South Dakota requires libraries and schools to install filtering software. New laws in Idaho heighten the requirements to form library districts and mandate stricter internet filtering policies that are tied to state funding.
In contrast, several Northeastern states have passed legislation protections for libraries and librarians and anti-censorship laws.
New Jersey, Delaware, Rhode Island and Connecticut have each enacted “freedom to read” or other laws that codify protections against ideological censorship in libraries.
Connecticut also took a major step in modernizing libraries in the digital age, the report said, becoming the first state in the nation to pass a law regulating how libraries license and manage e-books and digital audiobooks.

There was always something that didn’t quite add up when American conservatives complained about federal budget deficits. Despite their supposed commitment to fiscal discipline, no factor has played a larger role in soaring deficits than Republican tax cuts enacted under presidents Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and Donald Trump.
Indeed, during the administration of President Bill Clinton, modest income tax hikes on corporations and the wealthy helped spur budget surpluses that began to retire the federal debt. Similar strategies during the Obama and Biden years led to declining deficits.
Unfortunately, as the Congressional Budget Office reported last week,deficit reduction Oh, and the CBO notes that it will also cause 10 million people to lose access to health insurance.
The bottom line: The only area in which Trump’s big bill is “conservative” is in the lack of care it extends to human beings. When it comes to fiscal policy, it’s an exercise in undisciplined runaway spending of the highest order.

U.S. District Judge Timothy L. Brooks of the Western District of Arkansas permanently blocked the state from enforcing Act 689 of 2023 in March, ruling it violates the First Amendment because it doesn’t serve a compelling government interest in restricting speech.

NetChoice v Griffin Ruling 040125 
Act 689 required social media platforms to verify the age of all account holders in Arkansas. Those under 18 could only access sites with parental permission. The law was the first of its kind in the nation and was a priority of Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders in her first year in office. Brooks’ ruling was the first win for NetChoice, a nonprofit tech trade group, in lawsuits it brought against several other states with similar laws.
Brooks’ ruling Wednesday came in response to a motion Griffin filed in April that argued the judge shouldn’t have enjoined the entirety of the law because the ruling didn’t address parts of the law that wouldn’t harm NetChoice’s members.
Brooks denied Griffin’s motion to alter his ruling, saying the law couldn’t be split into pieces as the attorney general argued and had to be considered as a whole since the legislation didn’t include a severability clause. The judge also noted that Griffin didn’t make the argument to sever parts of Act 689 prior to the court’s final ruling and couldn’t be allowed to make it now.
“Although Defendant failed to raise severability and is therefore not entitled to relief on this basis … the Court briefly notes that the argument also fails on the merits,” Brooks wrote in his four-page ruling.
Griffin’s motion also argued that the ruling on Act 689 should be altered because the Legislature approved a new law, Act 900 of 2025, which lawmakers adopted in reaction to Brooks’ ruling. 
Act 900 amends the earlier law and prohibits social media platforms from engaging in practices “to evoke any addiction or compulsive behaviors” in minors, and changed the definition of a minor to someone 16-years-old or younger. Act 901 allows parents to sue social media platforms if content on their sites results in their child developing eating disorders, committing or attempting suicide, or becoming addicted to the platform’s feeds.
NetChoice filed a fresh lawsuit against the new laws in June.

Families across our state are now caught in immigration limbo, not because they’ve done something wrong, but because of outdated immigration laws, systemic inefficiencies and abrupt policy shifts.
Individuals who were working legally, under valid protections, have seen those protections revoked with no timely path to renewal. Many are now being forced into the complex and overloaded asylum process, with six-month waits for work permits if they’re eligible at all.
The recent raids at Glenn Valley Foods made clear how deeply broken the system has become. Despite new Department of Homeland Security directives that claim to prioritize targeted enforcement, what we witnessed was mass detention with little regard for due process.
Workers were taken without access to legal counsel, including some transferred across the state without notifying their families, and many were pressured to sign documents they did not understand.
These actions contradict both the spirit and the letter of due process protections. When federal policy is applied in ways that sidestep transparency and accountability, it leaves entire communities in fear and families without answers.
That means families can’t earn income, and employers lose talented people they depend on. Nebraska’s economy counts on their contributions. Approximately 140,000 Nebraskans are foreign-born, and 86,000 more are the U.S.-born children of immigrants.
Together, we contribute over $1.3 billion in state and local taxes each year. Losing that stability is a lose-lose scenario for immigrant families and for all Nebraskans.
Systemic changes needed
We are in the midst of a workforce crisis, a community crisis and at a moment when legal processes are being systematically undermined. Public schools are stretched even thinner after losing professionals who provide essential academic and emotional support. Local businesses are struggling to stay open.
Employers in key industries, including hospitality, food processing, construction and healthcare, are facing major labor shortages. Nursing homes are losing essential caregivers. Entire families are going silent: afraid, uncertain, unsure of where to turn.
The immigration system in the U.S. is exclusionary by design, built to restrict, delay and deter. And yet Nebraska’s demographics tell a different story about what the state truly needs.

With an aging population, low birth rates and widespread labor shortages, Nebraska is increasingly dependent on immigrants to sustain its economy and communities. Our state’s future vitality hinges on our ability to welcome and retain new residents, not push them into fear and instability.
Immigration isn’t just a national issue, it’s an issue that matters to Nebraska’s survival. The collateral damage of the current approach is not public safety, it is fear and desperation. Families are trapped in an in-between space, unable to return to the countries they fled and forced to navigate a system riddled with contradictions: “Do it the right way,” we say. But then we close every door that leads to “right.”
Increased vulnerability is the reliable outcome. When people fear that seeking help could lead to detention or deportation, they become easy targets for scams, labor exploitation and human trafficking.
We’ve seen workers endure unsafe or unpaid conditions rather than risk contact with authorities. We’ve heard stories of domestic violence survivors choosing silence over calling the police. When families are pushed into the shadows, abuse goes unreported, crimes go un-investigated, and justice becomes inaccessible.
Our communities are safer and more stable when every resident feels safe enough to ask for help.
The current form of immigration enforcement fractures neighborhoods, disrupts classrooms, destabilizes entire sectors and erodes the trust that holds communities together. Border security matters, but security without humanity undermines the very values that make Nebraskans proud — values like hard work, family, and mutual care.
This is about people.
How people can help
What can we do?
There are practical, bipartisan solutions already embedded in law. We just need the will to act.
● Create a path to residency for Dreamers and Temporary Protected Status holders: These are Nebraskans who have grown up here, worked here and given back. They deserve a future rooted in security, not uncertainty.
● Reduce reliance on temporary visas and create pathways for individuals to present their cases for legal status based on community ties, work history and humanitarian need, not just narrow categories.
● Update the “registry” date: This long-standing immigration law allows people who’ve lived in the U.S. for decades to apply for permanent residency and stand in line as we ask. However, it hasn’t been updated in 39 years. Moving the date forward could provide relief to hundreds of thousands of long-settled residents using existing law.
To those watching from a distance, come closer. People who want to help can support legal funds. They can give and support the organizers and nonprofits helping families. Show up. Be an active participant in the decisions that are being made around you and about you. Learn your neighbors’ names.
Most of all, Nebraskans can challenge the dangerous narrative that enforcement equals safety. Because real safety doesn’t come from raids or revoked protections. It comes from earned trust, from stability and from the dignity of being seen.

Wes Moore (D) inspects damage in Westernport on May 15, in the wake of flooding in the previous week. The state learned this week that its request for federal disaster assistance had been turned down by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. (Photo by Patrick Siebert/Governor's office)State leaders said they plan to appeal the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s denial of disaster assistance for Western Maryland communities slammed by flooding in May.
Little explanation was given for the denial of the request, which state officials said more than met thresholds for federal assistance. The bad news, delivered in what one official called “just a basic letter that said you were denied,” contrasted sharply with President Donald Trump’s effusive announcement on social media Tuesday that FEMA had approved $11.7 million in disaster assistance for areas of West Virginia hit by flooding and tornadoes in June.
“It’s definitely a gut punch and it hurts,” said Sen. Mike McKay (R-Western Maryland). He said he believes FEMA will provide more information on the denial later.
The request was in response to damage caused to parts of Allegany and Garrett counties after “extreme rainfall” between May 12 and 14 inundated several towns.
George’s Creek surged to more than 12 feet above major flood stage. Wills Creek in Cumberland rose 8 feet. The Potomac River also flooded. Areas of both counties were evacuated. Midland, Lonaconing and Westernport were among the hardest-hit areas.
Gov. Wes Moore (D), who visited the area soon after the storms, declared a state of emergency. The state also quickly filed for federal disaster assistance.
In a statement Wednesday, Moore said the flooding caused millions in damages to “more than 200 homes, numerous businesses, roads and bridges, railroads, sewer systems, drinking water, and public utilities.”
Maryland, 19 other states sue to block Trump from dismantling disaster preparation program

Official damage estimates in the initial request approached $80 million, and McKay said additional damage to the George’s Creek Railroad and from exposed water and gas lines brought the total up to $90 million. Many of those damages were offset by insurance claims and further reduced through a “joint assessment” process in which FEMA agrees with some claims but denies others, until the damage estimate was reduced to $15.8 million.
But Moore said Allegany County’s threshold for FEMA assistance is $321,460 and Maryland’s is nearly $11.7 million. The damage from the May floods “clearly met disaster assistance criteria established by” FEMA, Moore’s statement said.
“These communities demonstrated a clear need through FEMA’s own process, and Maryland will appeal the decision to seek all available resources to support the recovery efforts,” he said.
In addition to seeking federal assistance, Maryland provided direct aid to residents and businesses. Allegany County got nearly $460,000 from a state disaster recovery fund through the Maryland Department of Emergency Management, and the state also provided $1 million to Allegany and Garrett counties through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.
While he was puzzled by the federal rejection, McKay praised the state’s response, saying “the governor has just hit a home run for the attention to this natural disaster that we had, including letting us know as soon as they got the [FEMA denial] letter.”
McKay said he has “got to see what the details are” of the denial. “Then we’ll see what the process is for us to appeal the decision,” he said.
Maryland Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Angela Alsobrooks and 6th District Rep. April McClain Delaney, all Democrats, called for a reconsideration of the initial denial of aid.
“Two months after flash flooding tore through these communities, they are still in need of support to repair public schools and libraries that were inundated, roads and bridges that were washed out, and homes and businesses that were left severely damaged,” their joint statement said.
“Even though the cost of the damage in these two rural Maryland counties exceeds the threshold for federal assistance, the Administration is refusing to come to their aid,” they said. “We strongly urge the President to reconsider this decision and deliver federal resources to Allegany and Garrett Counties so they are not forced to shoulder the burden of recovery on their own.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Western Maryland is not only one of the state’s more economically challenged regions, it is an area that is dominated by Republicans who voted for Trump, who has called FEMA “a disaster” and said states should handle disaster recovery with the federal government reimbursing some of the costs.
McKay dismissed, for now, questions about the denial coming as Trump imposes his vision of government that includes deep cut to budget, staffing and agencies.
“I just don’t think the time to play politics is now,” he said. “I really just don’t think that we are being penalized because we as a state didn’t support the president, and that the three western counties did support the president. But it’s a valid question.”
Even though the denial is “a gut punch,” McKay said “at this point, to not know what the report is about, what has and hasn’t been assessed — I just don’t think it’s fair at that point to already get upset with the administration.”
McKay said the denial and need to appeal means his community will have to work harder on their own as state officials work through the process. But he worries that, with Allegeny County being one of the poorest in the state, “there’s no blood from this turnip.”
“We’re already behind the eight ball. We’re already behind it. This just makes it that much harder,” he said. “We were hoping that the federal government would come through. It’s very, very disappointing that it hasn’t, but there again, we haven’t gotten the backup documentation yet.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PS3_4183-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-07-24 02:01:19.576273

(Photo via the St. Johns RIverkeeper)What is it about Florida’s rivers that makes us humans want to spoil them?
The Kissimmee River worked perfectly for centuries, feeding a flow of fresh water into Lake Okeechobee. Then the Army took out all the bends to stop flooding. When the Corps of Engineers realized it had created a dirty ditch that funneled pollution right into Lake Okeechobee, it spent millions of dollars putting them all back.
The Apalachicola River worked just fine, creating exactly the right conditions for spawning delicious oysters in the bay. Then people ruined the flow, which ruined the mix, and now we’ve spent years trying to bring the oysters back.
And of course, the Ocklawaha River was a wild and scenic waterway until the state built a dam that blocked the river and flooded 800 acres of the Ocala National Forest. People keep trying to tear down the dam, but Gov. Ron DeSantis has vetoed the funding for that not once but twice. (And don’t get me started on what he’s doing to the River of Grass right now.)
Last week, I saw a story that detailed how we’ve been messing up another Florida river, this time the fabulous St. Johns.
“Report: Miami-area sewage sludge raising cost of St. Johns River cleanup over $1 billion,” said the headline in the Florida Times-Union.
In case you’re not familiar with Florida geography, Miami is nowhere near the St. Johns River. So how is its sludge winding up there? 
The paper explains that a change in state rules “triggered increased sludge-dumping in the St. Johns upper basin, around Brevard and Indian River counties.” 
The St. Johns is the rare river that flows northward. That means dumping pollution in its southern headwaters leads to that nasty stuff being carried north into the river’s more populated reaches, creating the right conditions for toxic algae blooms.
The fact that the taxpayers who live along the St. Johns have been paying lots of money to clean up the river, only to see pollution from elsewhere in the state mess it up again, is particularly frustrating, said Lisa Rinaman of the nonprofit St. Johns Riverkeeper.
“We’re seeing evidence of significant pollution being transferred here from South Florida,” she told me.
What’s particularly maddening, she said, is that nobody wants to claim responsibility for fixing the problem.

The noblest stream
The St. Johns is the longest river in Florida. It flows 310 miles from its headwaters at Blue Cypress Lake in Indian River County to where it runs into the Atlantic Ocean east of Jacksonville.
In 1843, the poet and editor William Cullen Bryant visited Florida and declared the St. Johns to be one of “the noblest streams in the country.” It’s also one of the laziest, because its elevation drops a mere one inch per mile over the course of its sluggish flow.
But its watershed is huge, covering nearly 9,000 square miles. The population of the watershed is more than 5 million people, from anglers in Palatka to shipbuilders in Jax.
The river has become the primary source of drinking water for communities in Brevard and other east central Florida counties. A 2015 University of Florida study found that it provides billions of dollars in economic impact and ecosystem services.
So even if you’re no tree hugger, you can see why a clean St. Johns is a goal worth working toward.
Like a lot of rivers in Florida, though, the St. Johns has suffered from problems of too much polluted runoff, too many water withdrawals to accommodate a growing population and the loss of wetlands wiped out by rampant development. 
State and local officials were working on dealing with all those problems and had made progress.
But then the trucks began showing up from South Florida.
 Toxic sludge is good for you

While researching this column, I watched a recent meeting of the St. Johns River Water Management District, where staff members talking about biosolids abbreviated the term as “BS.” That turns out to be pretty apt.
I first learned about biosolids (and the BS around it) from a book called “Toxic Sludge Is Good for You!” by John Stauber and Sheldon Rampton, which one reviewer called “a chilling analysis of the PR business.”
That book’s title comes from a campaign to convince people that it’s OK to dump sludge produced by sewer plants and septic tanks near their homes. The PR folks advised their clients that the way to convince the public that it was OK was to change the name to “biosolids.” It sounded less frightening, less … oh, what’s the word? Oh yeah, “toxic.” 
It worked — until the smell got out. Shakespeare told us that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet. Turns out that’s also true for (pee-yoo!) “biosolids.”
No matter what you call it, the sewage sludge that’s classified as “Class B” remains pretty toxic, containing lots of phosphorus and nitrogen. Those pollutants stimulate the growth of algae blooms that kill fish and other marine life. The sludge also carries heavy metals. What’s worse is that it also contains PFAS, also known as “forever chemicals.” As the Guardian explained in a recent story, “The chemicals are linked to a range of serious health problems such as cancer, liver disease, kidney issues, high cholesterol, birth defects and decreased immunity.”
Yet lots of Florida sewer plants spew this dangerous stuff out and then act as if it’s as safe as raindrops and sell it to farmers to use as fertilizer. 
That became a serious problem when the haulers were dumping the sludge on land around Lake Okeechobee, because then the pollutants wound up in the Everglades.
Thus, in 2007, the Legislature passed a law that basically banned farms near Lake Okeechobee, the Kissimmee River, and the Everglades from accepting the nearly 100,000 tons of South Florida’s sewage sludge being trucked in there. 
But they didn’t ban it everywhere. 
As a result, the trucks simply headed north and started dumping their toxic loads at farms in the St. Johns watershed. As the state’s population boomed, they had more and more sludge to spread all over the farms there.

Suddenly the St. Johns started having serious problems with excessive phosphorus and nitrogen. And in the 17 years since the change in the law, it’s been a growing problem. By 2019, Florida Today was calling Central Florida “sludge central.”
“So the South Florida affluent have been sending their effluent up to us,” quipped water district board member Doug Burnett, a retired Florida National Guard general. 
It wasn’t enough
The water management district meeting that I watched featured a loooooong discussion of the biosolids problem. 
There was supposed to be a staff report on the latest scientific findings about biosolids (spoiler alert: they’re bad but still being spread). This was the result of a study requested by the state’s environmental regulation agency.
 But the staffer delivering the scientific report kept being interrupted by water district board members fuming about all the pollution being trucked in from elsewhere.
“You know, if it’s not good for the goose in South Florida, is it good for the gander in the St. Johns?” asked board member and boat manufacturer Chris Peterson. It was clear he thought the answer was no.
“As a society, we still haven’t figured out what to do when we flush the toilet,” complained board member Doug Bournique, a citrus grower.
And board chair Rob Bradley, a former legislator married to a current legislator, pointed out, “They didn’t do a study in South Florida — they just banned it.”
  Rob Bradley (photo via the St. Johns River Water Management District)
During the discussion, Bradley made an interesting confession to his fellow board members: “I was in the Legislature when we passed this (ban) and it wasn’t enough.” 
Bradley didn’t say anything about lobbying his wife, Sen. Jennifer Bradley, to take up the cause of extending the ban to the St. Johns watershed. He may want to consider that, since his water district board held off making any decisions.
There was some discussion about people who did do something to stop the toxic pollution fouling the St. Johns. For instance, Indian River County officials, already working to clean up their lagoon, refused to allow the dumping of biosolids, district officials said. 
And the state’s largest private landowner, Deseret Ranch – aka the Mormons — recently refused to allow biosolids to be dumped anywhere on its thousands of acres.
Yet the state Department of Environmental Protection, our environmental regulator, like the Legislature, continues to drag its feet about banning its use statewide. 
Where to put it
The water district folks also talked about how the DEP was trying to set new standards for the land application of Class B biosolids so they wouldn’t be quite so bad. 
To me, that’s like saying, “Let’s not BAN lighting sticks of dynamite inside an orphanage. Let’s just make the dynamite blast a trifle less explosive.”
But according to Rinaman, one of the state’s largest sludge haulers has been slow to comply with what the DEP wants.
The company in question, H&H Liquid Sludge Disposal, has been around for four decades. It boasts on its website of hauling sludge “from wastewater treatment plants to farms and ranches throughout Florida.”
From its plant in Clewiston, it “has land applied biosolids for more than 30 years, strictly adhering to DEP and local regulations to ensure the safety of the community, land and livestock.”
It also notes that the dumping of Class B biosolids is “heavily regulated due to its pathogens and metal composition.” So the company knows what they’re putting on the land.
But H&H wasn’t happy about the changes DEP was proposing to the use of Class B biosolids. The company has requested they be allowed a five-year delay in complying with those new rules.
Instead of saying no, the DEP asked for more information, which is another way of delaying doing anything.
I tried contacting H&H but got no response. To me, though, the lack of swift action is symptomatic of all the other delays that are actively harming the St. Johns. 
 The water district folks were adamant that the solution is not to redirect the sludge to somewhere else, the way the Legislature did back in 2007. But I think they’re wrong. As Iron Man says when he grabs hold of a nuke at the climax of The Avengers, “I know just where to put it.”
I would propose that all five water districts announce that they are imposing new regulations that say the only place where haulers can legally dump their toxic sludge is in Tallahassee – specifically, at the entrance to the Florida Senate and Florida House. 
Or maybe at the governor’s mansion.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd) Nearly 600,000 Kentuckians got help buying food through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in June 2025, according to the Cabinet for Health and Family Services. 
But the program, better known as SNAP, faces an uncertain future after Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a sweeping and controversial tax and spending package. 
The Trump administration insists that it’s not cutting SNAP, but the new law makes “effectively still a ton of cuts through other changes,” said Robin Kunkel, the outreach coordinator for the Kentucky Equal Justice Center. 
Changes to SNAP in the big budget bill have the potential to be a “huge hit to hungry people” in Kentucky, she said, as the number of people eligible for food benefits will decrease significantly.
Additionally, Kentucky would need to spend about an additional $250 million a year to fill gaps created by the changes Congress approved, according to Melissa McDonald, executive director of Feeding Kentucky, a statewide network of seven food banks.
During a July 10 meeting of Kentucky’s Make America Healthy Again task force, Roger McCann, the director of the state Division of Family Support, said Kentuckians received about $96 million in SNAP benefits in June. All those dollars came from the federal government and the majority benefitted children younger than 18.

What’s at stake? Child welfare, education and more. 
SNAP — and access to food in general — is a web that affects poverty, child wellbeing, economic growth and more, presenters said during the July MAHA meeting. 
Department for Community Based Services Commissioner Lesa Dennis said that about 70% of all Child Protective Services allegations are related to neglect and poverty. Hunger, she said, causes familial stress and instability in the home. 
“We know that poverty is not neglect,” she said. “Just because someone is poor does not mean that they are neglectful, but when we see unmet needs, such as lack of access to food, families … experiencing hunger, we see the increase in the risk of abuse and neglect.”
The budget bill that recently passed Congress with no Democratic votes cuts federal funding for SNAP Ed, a program that teaches families how to cook and budget that’s administered through the University of Kentucky, Dennis said. 
SNAP Ed doesn’t offer benefits, only education, McCann said, and costs about $11 million to operate. 
“It has been important because it helps build those healthy eating habits,” he said. “It’s cooking classes, it’s going out to schools and libraries and teaching people how to use fresh fruits and vegetables, and also how to do it on a budget.”  
The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) hasn’t provided guidance on how to wind the program down or what could replace it, McCann said. Funding for that program ends Sept. 30, according to Dennis. They are hoping the state can continue some sort of education component.  
“These are the things that make eating healthy the easy choice for folks,” McCann said. “Making sure that they have access to a SNAP retailer that has fresh fruits and vegetables in it, for example.”

Sen. Shelley Funke Frommeyer, R-Alexandria, who co-chairs Kentucky’s MAHA task force, told reporters after the July meeting that nutrition education is important.
During the August meeting, she said, “we will dig into further detail about the education that is part of SNAP.” That meeting is scheduled for Aug. 20, and Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner Jonathan Shell is scheduled to speak. 
“There are many components of education that are happening, but the presenters today acknowledged it’s complicated,” she said. “And we need to make it less complicated.” 
Two components of SNAP that remain intact under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are the outreach and employment training programs. 
Outreach is a 50-50 match program that’s administered through nonprofit organizations, such as food banks, that work with hungry people. Those nonprofits help guide people in applying for SNAP. 
Employment Training will also continue, McCann, the cabinet’s family support director, said. This program involves offering job training and can be reimbursed up to 50% from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
“The best way to overcome food insecurity is through a job — or a better job,” he said. “And so the idea behind SNAP Employment Training is to help people who utilize SNAP become income ineligible — to have enough money that they’re no longer eligible, and they’re able to stabilize and no longer need that, and then, by resolving that food insecurity through income, they can eat better and have better nutrition.” 
The numbers breakdown

Currently, the state splits the cost of administering SNAP 50-50 with the federal government. Starting Oct. 1, 2026, the ratio shifts, putting 75% of the cost on states, according to McDonald of Feeding Kentucky. The change will cost Kentucky $66 million, according to Dennis with the CHFS. 
McCann said the cabinet is “currently evaluating that” shift in cost sharing.
Additionally, beginning in 2028, Kentucky will have to pay for its share of SNAP at a rate dependent on the rate of error in the state program. 
Kentucky is looking at an additional $200 million, roughly, based on the 2024 error rate of nearly 10%. 
In total, McDonald said, Kentucky would need to put up about $250 million to run the program annually. 
It’s not clear what appetite the Republican-controlled General Assembly will have to provide that funding. Funke Frommeyer said the Senate Republican caucus hadn’t yet met to discuss it as of July 10 and “and none of us really knew what would be the result of the bill.”

Rep. Jason Petrie, R-Elkton, who co-chairs the 2026–2028 Budget Preparation & Submission Committee, said state lawmakers are “closely examining recent changes” to SNAP “at the federal level to fully understand their potential impact on both Kentucky’s SNAP recipients and the agencies responsible for administering these benefits.” 
“These federal modifications include expanded work requirements, as well as a new mandate that states assume financial responsibility for a portion of benefits that were issued in error,” Petrie said in a statement to the Lantern. “While these developments may present new challenges, our commitment to responsible budgeting remains unchanged.” 
Kentucky took in nearly $16 billion in revenue for its General Fund during the fiscal year that ended June 30. 
According to McCann: 

There were 280,771 active SNAP households in June 2025. This number fluctuates each month.
562,105 individuals received SNAP benefits in June 2025.  
$96 million worth of SNAP benefits went out in June, all from the federal government.  
The average SNAP household in Kentucky gets $343 a month. 
39.28% of the folks that receive SNAP are under the age 18. In June, that was 220,000.
16% of Kentuckians receiving SNAP are 60 and older. In June, that was 91,000. 

The ‘vicious cycle’ of hunger 
Kentucky has millions of acres dedicated to farming and produces billions in agricultural products like corn and eggs. Still, people are hungry. 
The 2025 Map the Meal Gap report, based on data from 2023, shows that about 70% of food insecure Kentuckians fall within the threshold that qualifies them for SNAP benefits; about 30% are above it.

In total, 753,410 Kentuckians are food insecure, according to the report, meaning they’re not sure where their next meal will come from. Overall, nearly 17% of Kentuckians have some shortage of food. 
Jordan Ojile, Feeding Kentucky’s advocacy manager, said these folks face “a chronic lack of nutrition that is secure, and this is concerning to us.” 
“Food insecurity is a vicious cycle,” he told lawmakers during the July MAHA meeting. “It leads to a decrease in options and quality of your diet, which leads to a decrease in healthy behaviors when it comes to eating, which … does lead to chronic disease, which will ultimately lead to increase in health care expenditures, a decrease in employability, which will ultimately decrease your health income, which feeds into the snowball effect of increased food insecurity.” 
Kentuckians spend their SNAP benefits at nearly 5,000 convenience stores, farmers, grocery stores, supermarkets, some pharmacies and super stores, according to the cabinet. 
  Robin Kunkel, the outreach coordinator for Kentucky Equal Justice Center, which advocates for vulnerable populations, said changes to the SNAP program in the big budget bill have the potential to be a “huge hit to hungry people.” (Photo provided)
“SNAP  is not just there to benefit the people who receive it,” Kunkel told the Lantern. “It’s also a huge influx of federal money that comes into our state.” 
It also better positions schools to buy local meat and dairy, supporting farmers and feeding children high quality food. 
Steve McClain, spokesman for the Kentucky Retail Federation said it’s “too early to tell” the full impact of SNAP changes on grocery stores in the state. 
“The Kentucky Grocers and Convenience Store Association is closely monitoring the potential impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on SNAP benefits in the Commonwealth,” McClain said in a statement. “We recognize the significant role that SNAP benefits play in food security for Kentucky families, financial stability for local grocers and overall economic stability for our communities — and will continue collaborating with federal and state officials as we move toward the act’s full implementation.”
Looking to 2026: ‘Protect those that are hungry.’  
McDonald, of Feeding Kentucky, said she wants to see Kentucky lawmakers make a commitment to continue SNAP, through legislation and/or the budget in 2026. 
“We need to make sure that SNAP will be protected. There needs to be something that is put into place to guarantee that our lawmakers in Kentucky are going to protect those that are hungry,” she said. “There’s going to have to be a level of commitment from our legislators and from the budget to show … that there will still be a SNAP program, and here’s what it’s going to look like.”  
So much is at stake — children losing access to free meals, increased hunger-induced stress, worse education outcomes and more, Kunkel said. 
“When your local economy takes a hit, and your local food producers take a hit, we all suffer,” she said. “I do well when my neighbor’s doing well…I don’t think we have been creating policy or state budgets to really acknowledge that.”

But it is vital to remember this crisis is not about properties, it is about people.","Everyone needs a place to live. That is something not seriously debated or disputed by Connecticut policymakers.
What was debated, disputed-–and in the end, discarded–- is the idea that the places people live should not be suddenly, and without justification, taken away from them.
“Just Cause” eviction protections, which prevent landlords removing a tenant without cause, already exist for seniors (age 62 and up) and people with disabilities in this state. Five states, including our neighbors in New Hampshire and New Jersey, already require landlords to give a reason for evicting any tenant. Importantly, the bill would have only applied to properties with five or more units and would not have affected small local landlords.
Why couldn’t Connecticut, facing our own growing crisis with housing and homelessness, take this step to provide stability for families–who already face spiraling rental costs–and prevent price-gouging practices by unscrupulous landlords?
State Rep. Antonio Felipe told the CT Mirror last month that he believed “we have the votes.” But somehow, the vote never happened. According to Felipe, that’s because too many lawmakers were afraid to be “public” with their support of “Just Cause.”
Protecting Connecticut families from arbitrary evictions should not be something legislators on either side of the political spectrum shrink from. The idea that a tenant who pays rent on time and follows all the rules should keep their living space cannot be controversial. Opponents to this measure, led by deep-pocketed landlords, claimed counter-intuitively (and bizarrely) that these measures would worsen the housing crisis by disincentivizing landlords from maintaining properties, leading (somehow) to a decrease in housing units.
Connecticut’s housing crisis is finally being acknowledged broadly, with a huge dearth of affordable places to live and high costs squeezing families in nearly every town. But it is vital to remember this crisis is not about properties, it is about people. 
While building more living spaces remains essential, we cannot expect renters (largely young people) to thrive in our state under the constant threat of being forced from their homes. Career prospects, school performance, community connections -–all hinge on a stable living space. It would be deeply misguided, and dangerous, to continue working on other aspects of the housing crisis without shoring up the foundation. 
Landlords themselves should -–and often do–- appreciate the stability that comes from having a reliable and responsible tenant long-term. We cannot expect our state to grow and flourish when so many, especially families and vulnerable people, live with the threat of arbitrary or retaliatory eviction.
Families who know they can be evicted without cause are at the mercy of the property owner. They must either accept poor living conditions, or risk being ejected in retaliation for a complaint. Families end up in hotels, lose work or miss school, and an eviction case can make it nearly impossible to find another stable living place.
This legislative session marks the second time the landlord lobby has prevented this vital protection at the base of our housing system. But we, as people who live in this state and care deeply about Connecticut, cannot let the principles that underpin these sorts of eviction protections disappear. 
We will solve our current housing crisis, through cross-partisan work that starts with neighbors getting together and focusing on common-sense policies and practices that transcend partisanship. 
“Just Cause” eviction protections must continue to be part of that process, in our state, and in every city and town that wants its residents to thrive.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-24 04:01:05+00:00,CT Mirror,Fixing CT’s HB5002 — Part Two,Tim Hollister,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/24/fixing-cts-hb5002-part-two-hollister/,"Here are ten modifications, adjustments and deletions that would improve HB5002 -- the land-use legislation vetoed by the governor.","Part One of this two-part piece on Connecticut’s HB5002 — the land use bill vetoed by Gov. Ned Lamont — explained the elements of the legislation and made some observations of their benefits and failings. Today’s installment takes a close look at the bill’s major and most controversial components, the Big Five.
Parking
Excessive parking requirements are a well-known and frequently used exclusionary zoning technique.  Parking spaces consume land and reduce density.  H.B. 5002’s proposal to jettison both unfettered municipal discretion and one-size-fits-all parking ratios in favor of a site-specific needs assessment is a prudent modification to our land use system.


All developers strive to get parking right.  They have to because if a development is under-parked, residents are unhappy, neighbors bear the burden of overflow parking, acrimony results, and rents go down due to the inconvenience.  Overparked and over-paved developments are a waste of time and money, and bad for the environment.  The site-specific needs assessment mandated by the bill will utilize data from the Institute of Transportation Engineers and the Urban Land Institute, which are based on actual experience nationwide.
Parking need is not what it used to be.  Remote work, transit-oriented development, ride-sharing, and Uber and Lyft-type services reduce the number of households that need cars.
In 2021, the General Assembly adopted a ban on excessive minimum floor area requirements.  This ban, combined with limits on parking requirements, will make more land developable and lower per unit cost, which is exactly how housing efficiency should be achieved.
If legislators are not comfortable leaving parking to the bill’s needs assessment process, the bill could be amended to require a minimum such as at least one half or one space for each residential unit; but again, we should recognize that an applicant who does not provide parking undermines the development’s value. Also, “shared parking” should be called out expressly as a consideration in the parking needs assessment.
The parking provisions of §§ 2, 3 and 42 (the latter repeals the 2021 provisions) should stay in the bill.  They will promote affordability.
Middle housing
Section 8-2s of the existing General Statutes, adopted in 2024, allows zoning commissions to approve middle housing as of right “on any lot that allows for residential use, commercial use or mixed-use development.”  Section 2 of H.B. 5002 adds a mandate that every municipality’s zoning regulations “shall” allow “as of right” “middle housing development,” as defined in the bill, on “any lot that is zoned for commercial use,” except that the regulations “may require that a site plan conforms with applicable zoning regulations and that public health and safety will not be substantially impacted” by such development.
This provision states a worthwhile goal and process and one that encompasses both affordable and market-rate housing objectives, but it is unclear in several important ways.
Section 19 defines “middle housing development” as “a residential building containing not less than two dwelling units but not more than nine such units, including but not limited to, townhomes, duplexes, triplexes, perfect sixes, and cottage clusters,” and a perfect six as “a three-story building with a central entrance containing two dwelling units per story.”
The first thing to notice is that this definition says that “the development” must be between two and nine units, so apparently if a lot zoned commercial is three acres, with sewer, water, and traffic access, the maximum density on the parcel regardless of acreage and infrastructure is nine units total?
Second, what the provision gives, it then takes away.  What if the municipality adopts site plan regulations that effectively undermine middle housing development, including the as-of-right process?
Does the phrase “public health and safety will not be substantially impacted” have the same meaning as § 8-30g, and since the development is as of right, does the zoning commission have the burden in its decision or in an appeal to prove such impact?
“Zoned for commercial use” is problematic.  Section 8-30g contains an exemption for land “zoned industrial” that has been an issue in more than a dozen court cases, and has prompted some commissions to rezone land to industrial for the sole purpose of avoiding affordable housing. A common, simple definition of “commercial use” is “activity involving the sale of goods or services carried out for profit.”
Given these key issues and the fact that this § 2 affects every lot “zoned commercial” in the state, it seems that the problems in this section alone justified the governor’s veto. My suggestions for fixing this section are:

Define “zoned commercial,” and broadly, along the lines of “any zone that allows as a permitted or specially permitted use private sector business-related activity involving the sale of goods or services, excluding industrial, light industrial, manufacturing, governmental, and institutional uses.” Make it clear that “zoned commercial” shall be broadly construed, as a remedial statute, to promote affordable housing development.
Do not limit a middle housing development to nine units. Like § 8-30g, let the requirement of no public health or safety impact be the factor that limits excessive density; and recognize that the definition of middle housing limits the massing, and available infrastructure regulates density.
Clarify that a middle housing development must conform to a municipality’s site plan regulations, instead of the unclear requirement that the site plan must conform to “applicable zoning regulations.”
One other alternative for the promotion of middle housing is to specify that any development composed completely of the type of structure(s) that constitute middle housing will be governed by a process akin to § 8-30g – if denied and appealed, the zoning commission must prove that its denial is based on a substantial public health and safety concern. The existing § 2 of H.B. 5002 comes close to this, but does not quite get there.  Why not use the existing § 8-30g caselaw, 35 years of defined standards, if we truly want to promote middle housing as an alternative to multi-family?

Fair share/ “Towns Take the Lead”
In Public Act 21-29, the state established a requirement that every municipality, at least every five years, adopt an affordable housing plan, a/k/a a “Section 8-30j” plan.  The 2021 act contained sparse guidance for what the plans should contain, and specified a relatively short deadline in 2022 for filing the initial plan.
During 2022-23, I co-chaired (with State Rep. Roland Lemar) the Affordable Housing Plans Working Group, a committee of the Commission on Connecticut’s Future and Growth.  Our diverse, experienced group was tasked — while the towns were writing their initial plans — with developing guidance for future plans.  In turn, we reviewed every filed plan, and used what we read in assembling our recommendations.  
Our February 2023 report is online.  While recognizing the challenges of the task, our overall assessment (as stated in our report) was that this initial “towns take the lead on affordable housing” resulted in plans that were mostly replete with grumbling, perfunctory compliance, and suffered from a distinct lack of specifics. We did highlight about 15 towns that set a good example for what a plan should be.
After our reviews and process, we developed a checklist of 15 specific factors that a municipality should consider when crafting an affordability plan (§ VII of the Report). In January 2025, I converted the list to a draft bill and submitted it to legislative leaders as a “towns take the lead” proposal. In H.B. 5002, however, the legislature embraced a different towns-take-the-lead approach, the Fair Share provisions, §§ 6 and 7.  These sections are complex prescriptions, but in brief summary, they propose to:

Convert § 8-30j, the affordable housing plan requirement, into a mechanism to require municipalities to adopt zoning regulations that will enable construction of a specific percentage of the number of affordable units that the Office of Policy and Management, in a program carried out in the past year, has “allocated” for each municipality;
Establish a revised set of target household income levels; and
Require each municipality to adopt regulations that will provide a “realistic opportunity” for the development of the specified percentage/number of affordable units, with this term defined by a list of broad-stroke steps such as “utilizing municipal powers” including zoning regulations to promote lower cost housing.

The Fair Share provisions then identify a category of municipalities — generally speaking the 80 percent with the highest per capita grand list — that are tasked with preparing a different type of affordable housing plan, a “priority affordable housing plan.”  The bill then contains highly prescriptive rules for unit types (such as “family units” and units for the elderly and disabled), number of bedrooms, and income levels that must be accommodated in such plans.
The most specific prescriptions require the plan to enable 25 percent of each municipality’s Fair Share allocation. Municipalities not meeting the specifications must provide an explanation to OPM as to why they could not comply, and must provide an alternative target.  Section 7 of the bill provides for an alternate calculation of a municipality’s housing unit allocation.
The state’s 169 towns are directed to file their initial plans under this new program in three staggered periods, 2027-2028-2029, proceeding alphabetically by town name.  The OPM Secretary must review and approve each plan.  Priority for “discretionary infrastructure funding” is stated as the financial incentive for compliance.
In my opinion, the Fair Share provisions can be improved as follows:

Classify the unit number allocation, a process now essentially complete, as the state’s measure of each town’s affordable housing need. This will help us put aside the perennial misstatement that ten percent affordable units is a statewide goal or quota.
However, at this time – to be revisited in the future – put aside the Fair Share allocation/percentage as a specific number that every town filing a “priority” plan must achieve through amendments to its land use regulations.
As an alternative prescription for the next cycle of municipal affordable housing plans, remove from Section 6 the “realistic opportunity” definition and the prescriptive mandates for regulation amendments, unit types, and household income limits (§§ 6(e) through (i)) and replace them with direction that § 8-30j plans “shall” utilize the checklist stated in the February 2023 Affordable Housing Plans Working Group Report. § VII. This change should respond to the angst expressed about Fair Share, and accommodate advocates by keeping and utilizing the Fair Share allocation as a new measure of need but not requiring every plan going forward to either achieve a specific percentage of the allocation, or explain the failure, or seek an alternative allocation.

Legislative language to implement the 2023 Working Group’s checklist as part of § 8-30j plans was drafted for the 2025 legislative session and is ready to go.

Transit-oriented development
Five sections (19, 20, 21, 23 and 25) aim to facilitate housing near public transportation.
The terminology and definition require close reading: there are qualifying bus, rapid transit, and transit-oriented communities and districts.  This program is opt-in, no mandates. Municipalities (“transit-oriented communities”) participate by creating a transit-oriented district that, through zoning regulation amendments and rezoning, allows as of right: (1) middle housing; (2) § 8-30g set aside developments of more than ten units; and (3) developments on land owned by the municipality or a non-profit or religious organization that will be 100 percent deed restricted at 60 percent of the area or state median income, whichever is less.  In addition, a municipality that has adopted a district shall allow “as of right” the conversion of any residential development or commercial development under any of the three categories listed above.
Any development within a district that is not allowed as of right and contains ten or more units must be subject to a 40-year deed restriction preserving units at 60 percent of area or statewide median income, or a “contribution agreement.”  The percentage of affordable units in one of the three development types will be five to ten percent as determined by CHFA’s most recent Housing Needs Assessment.
Section 19 then specifies priority eligibility for “discretionary infrastructure funding” as the financial incentive for municipalities to participate, though the bill also carefully specifies that non-participating municipalities will still be eligible.
Important details are deferred.  The OPM Secretary, in consultation with a new “interagency council on housing development,” is tasked with developing guidelines for districts including prioritizing mixed income and mixed use development; paying attention to environmental concerns including environmental justice; increasing mass transit use; decreasing motor vehicle travel; expediting approvals; modifying dimensional standards to facilitate density; and inclusionary zoning.
The OPM Secretary may grant exceptions if municipalities opt to establish districts that do not strictly meet the statute.
Municipalities that locate their districts in “activity zones” identified in the State Plan of Conservation and Development obtain additional funding priority.
Section 20 aims at recognizing the regional nature of public transit, allowing funding for municipalities adjacent to a qualifying transit-oriented community by adopting the specified type of zoning regulations, even if the municipality is not host to an actual rapid-transit facility.
Section 21 establishes the interagency council on housing development, to advise the Sate’s Responsible Growth Coordinator about implementing the transit-oriented program.
Finally, Section 25, notwithstanding that a municipality has opted out of the accessory apartment rules adopted in 2021, allows an owner of land for at least three years within a transit-oriented district to construct an accessory unit as of right.
In my opinion, the transit-oriented program is voluntary, realistically achievable, and reasonably well explained (albeit with added guidance forthcoming from OPM, the State Responsible Growth Coordinator, and the new interagency council).  It warrants continued inclusion in H.B. 5002.  These are no reasons to not give this program a try.
Priority housing development zones
Based on definitions contained in § 37, H.B. 5002’s § 38 allows a municipal zoning commission to adopt regulations to establish a “priority housing development zone.” Such a zone must:

Be consistent with the State Plan of Conservation and Development (generally, Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 16a-24 and following);
Obtain from the Commissioner of the Department of Housing a determination that the regulations are “likely to substantially increase production of new units necessary to meet housing needs,” including the categories of housing stated in the Zoning Enabling Act;
Allow multi-family housing “as of right”;
Allow at least four units per acre for single-family housing, six units for duplexes and townhouses, and ten units for multi-family;
Not require a special permit
Consist of at least ten percent of the “developable land” (a defined term) within the municipality; and
Be consistent with the Zoning Enabling Act, including its economic diversity and fair housing provisions. However, a zoning commission may “modify, waiver, or eliminate” dimensional standards to achieve the minimum densities.  A priority housing zone may include business, commercial, and non-residential uses.

If a commission adopts a conforming priority zone, the Commissioner of Housing issues a letter of eligibility within 90 days of a request.  However, one year later, if building permits “or other indications of progress” have not occurred, the Commissioner can revoke the letter.  If this occurs in a municipality that currently has a § 8-30g moratorium, the Commissioner “shall also rescind” the moratorium.
Recognizing that this bill originated in the Governor’s office, my opinion is that it should be removed from H.B. 5002 for at least these reasons: (1) §§ 37-39 are essentially a retread of General Statutes §§ 8-13m and following the 2007 Incentive Housing Program, which as noted withered when its financial incentives did not materialize; (2) it is hard to imagine a municipality adopting a zone covering ten percent of its “developable land”; (3) the definition of developable land is complex, time-consuming, and subjective; (4) “consistency” with the State Plan of Conservation and Development will be difficult if not impossible for most municipalities to achieve, because that Plan is focused on “growth zones” which are generally in or near our urban areas; (5) it is hard to imagine a municipality that has achieved a § 8-30g moratorium putting that relief at risk of rescission by agreeing to a deadline for issuing building permits; and (6) we don’t need the confusion of the term “priority housing zone.”
I would delete §§ 37-39.  Doing so will require revision of Section 34 regarding § 8-30g moratorium points.
Conclusion
In summary as to H.B. 5002:

Retain all of the “Improvements to existing housing programs”; all of the “Financial programs”; all of the “Land Use procedural reforms”; and all of the “further study” provisions, as summarized above.
Modify or remove the § 8-30g attorneys’ fees provisions (§17).
Retain the parking sections.
Modify the middle housing provisions as discussed above.
Modify the Fair Share/Towns Take the Lead provisions as explained above.
Retain the transit-oriented programs.
Remove the Priority Housing Development Zone provisions.

As a last piece of the pie, I also recommend reconsideration of two proposals I advanced in my Part 4 September 2024 CT Mirror articles, what I called the “low hanging fruit”:

Require all zoning and planning commissions, by a specific date such as June 1, 2026, to amend their zoning regulations to comply with the 2021 amendments now codified in General Statutes § 8-2(d) (the “shall not” provisions regarding zoning regulations) because four years later, dozens of towns have not done so; and
Prohibit wetlands commissions from adopting or using stricter standards or criteria for affordable housing than for market rate housing.

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — Federal education officials are investigating the University of Nebraska at Omaha and four other universities nationally for scholarship programs that allegedly favor foreign-born students.
Announced Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Education, the probes are based on complaints by the Legal Insurrection Foundation’s Equal Protection Project, which seeks equal protection by the government “in any form.”
At UNO, the targets named are the Dreamer’s Pathway Scholarship and the HDR Scholarship.
A statement from the federal Education Department said the Dreamer’s undergraduate scholarship was for Nebraska residents that qualify for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status. The Obama administration launched the DACA program in 2012 to provide temporary relief from deportation to qualified immigrants who arrived illegally to the U.S. as children.
The HDR scholarship, according to the Education Department, gave preference to underrepresented minority students.
Sam Peshek, a spokesman for UNO, said the university would not comment on specifics but would cooperate with investigators.
“We continually evaluate our scholarships to ensure compliance with state and federal law,” he said.










They are the embodiment of the American dream. ... We should be encouraging and helping these kids that make our community stronger.”


– Nebraska State Sen. Dunixi Guereca of DACA recipients



	The Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights similarly opened investigations into the University of Louisville, University of Miami, University of Michigan and Western Michigan University.
According to the statement, department investigators will determine whether the schools are granting scholarships only for DACA or “undocumented” students in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964’s (Title VI) prohibition against discrimination based on a person’s national origin.
“Neither the Trump Administration’s America first policies nor the Civil Rights Act of 1964’s prohibition on national origin discrimination permit universities to deny our fellow citizens the opportunity to compete for scholarships because they were born in the United States,” said Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor.
William Jacobson, founder of the Equal Protection Project, said in the same statement that he was grateful the Trump administration acted on the complaint.
“Protecting equal access to education includes protecting the rights of American-born students,” he said.
Nebraska State Sen. Dunixi Guereca of South Omaha, who is the son of Mexican immigrants, called DACA recipients a positive addition to Nebraska and said they should be welcomed.
“They are the embodiment of the American dream,” he said. “They were brought here as children but are American. They’ve studied here. They work here. They obey the laws. We should be encouraging and helping these kids that make our community stronger.”
The probe is to extend beyond alleged DACA scholarships to “other allegedly impermissible and exclusionary scholarships detailed in the complaint,” including UNO’s HDR scholarship.
Among the others targeted: a University of Louisville scholarship for “LGBTQ+ students of color” and a Western Michigan University scholarship for “African American, Native American or Hispanic American” students.

(Photo courtesy Fuentes Espinal family)A man called a pillar of his Eastern Shore community is in custody at a Baltimore detention facility after he was picked up by immigration agents while driving to work Monday.
Daniel Fuentes Espinal has been pastor of Iglesia del Nazareno in Easton since 2015 — he is also an undocumented immigrant who fled the violence in his native Honduras in 2001 and put down roots on the Eastern Shore where he has ministered and raised a family.
Fuentes Espinal has no criminal record and has been trying to get approrval to become a U.S. citizen, said his daughter, Clarissa Fuentes Diaz.
The unpaid pastor works construction to support his family, Fuentes Diaz said Wednesday. She said her father was on a routine errand to the hardware store for building materials when he was arrested by unidentified agents Monday.
“I’ve heard stories about [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] at Lowe’s in the morning, picking up whoever seems to fit their narrative or racial profiling,” she said.
As immigration arrests surge, so does number of Maryland sheriffs agreeing to work with ICE

Fuentes Diaz said she was 8 when the family fled Honduras in 2001 to escape violence in search of a better life. Her two younger siblings were born in the United States. And, after a 16-year wait, she was recently notified that that she too would become a U.S. citizen.
“I was going to help my dad and mom get their papers straight,” she said, but that was before her father was arrested.
Fuentes Diaz says her father is a compassionate man of faith. His arrest has been devasting to the tight-knit community.
Len Foxwell, a longtime Easton resident and family friend, said the pastor led his congregation as a volunteer and regularly provided food, shelter, clothing and toys to those who needed help.
“He is known for his unconditional generosity to those who are the most vulnerable,” he said.
“It’s personal for me. Our sons were best friends,” Foxwell said, in the wake of his 18-year-old son’s death last month in a car accident. “Pastor [Fuentes] Espinal was at my son’s deathbed and spoke at his funeral.”
Immigrant arrests rise
Fuentes Espinal’s detention comes amid a sharp rise in immigration arrests, driven by President Donald Trump’s (R) campaign pledge to mount a massive deportation of immigrants in the U.S. That has led to ICE agents, often masked and militarized, arresting people at worksites, in courthouses and elsewhere, using tactics that Democrats on Capitol Hill criticized Wednesday as “cruel” and lawless.
The number of arrests by ICE in Maryland has more than doubled since the start of the year. The Deportation Data Project, a Berkeley, California, based research group, which has posted ICE detention documents back to September 2023, showed there were 384 immigration arrests in Maryland in the last four months of 2023, or about 3.1 per day. For all of 2024, there were 1,355 arrests in the state, a rate of about 3.7 per day.
But in the first six months of 2025, there were 1,769 Maryland apprehensions, or about 9.7 per day.
The data shows that 83% of those arrested in Maryland were men and 45% of all those detained had been convicted of a crime. Another 15% had criminal charges pending, according to ICE, while 40% had no criminal record.

The Fuentes Espinal family has reached out for help from to their representatives in Congress and to Gov. Wes Moore’s office. The case has brought support from groups as diverse as the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which called the arrest “alarming.”
“Detaining a widely respected pastor who has been serving the Maryland community for 20 years while attempting to rectify his legal status sends a chilling message,” said CAIR Maryland Director Zainab Chaudhry in a prepared statement.
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said his office has been in touch with the family and will continue to monitor the case.
“The Trump Administration clearly isn’t targeting the most dangerous criminals living the U.S. illegally – they are snatching up anyone they can find as they pursue their mass deportation agenda and terrorizing our communities in the process,” Van Hollen said in a prepared statement Wednesday.
The family heard Wednesday from Fuentes Espinal, who told them he had spoken with his lawyer and that a court date was set for Friday.
Multiple requests to ICE for comment via email have gone unanswered. The phone number given to the Fuentes Espinal family to track their loved one, is not in service.
Meanwhile the family waits.
Fuentes Diaz says it is her father’s unshakable faith that keeps them strong. When they talked to him shortly after the arrest, he told them to be strong, that they would be OK, Fuentes Diaz said.
“God is in control of my life, here, there anywhere,” she quoted him as saying. “I’m here doing God’s work, and I’ve been preaching to the six inmates with me in this cell. Maybe this is what I was to supposed to go through to come and shed light in someone else’s darkness.”

The post Should Massachusetts repeal its 2024 gun control law?  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THIS ISSUE BRIEF is part of a series examining a variety of controversial local and national issues, focusing on specific policy proposals that are under active consideration. The premise of these essays, as outlined here and here, is that many important public policy issues are more complicated than the most fervent adherents to either side usually acknowledges, a dynamic that often hinders our ability to engage in thoughtful debate. (Earlier essays in the series have addressed proposals for free community college; free MBTA service; right-to-shelter;  rent control; supervised injection sites; approval of school library books; reparations; voter ID requirements; a moratorium on prison construction; limiting investments in natural gas infrastructure, and universal basic income).  
The Proposal 
Repeal the 2024 gun-control law tightening up and expanding restrictions on the ownership, manufacture and registration of firearms in Massachusetts. 
Background 
As a result of the 2022 US Supreme Court ruling in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen, the Massachusetts law giving local police departments authority to issue concealed carry licenses only to individuals who have a “good reason” was effectively struck down as a violation of the Constitution’s Second Amendment. In response, the Legislature took up a gun control bill (H. 4885) to bring state law into compliance with Bruen, while addressing a number of additional issues. 
Among other things, the new law does the following: 

Clarifies and expands the ban on assault-style firearms, by defining them as semi-automatic weapons with the capacity to accept a detachable feeding device and certain other features associated with rapid firing, while preventing anyone under the age of 21 from buying such guns. 


Requires unique serial numbers to be etched into all manufactured or assembled firearms, which must be registered in a centralized state database. 


Prohibits anyone who does not have a “license to carry” from manufacturing a gun or gun parts using a 3-D printer. Such guns must also be imprinted with serial numbers that are registered with the state. 


Authorizes school administrators and licensed health care providers to petition the court for “extreme risk protection orders,” in addition to family members, roommates, or dating partners. 

A petition has since been filed to repeal H. 4885 through a so-called “veto referendum” to be included on the November 2026 state ballot. 
Bumper Stickers and Sticking Points 
Gun rights advocates believe that gun ownership is essential for personal safety, individual liberty, and a free society, while gun control activists hold that widespread gun ownership leads inevitably to disorder and deadly violence on a mass scale. 
If Guns are Outlawed, Only Outlaws will have Guns! Gun control laws serve only to restrict the constitutionally protected rights of law-abiding citizens, preventing them from protecting themselves against criminals and an over-reaching (left-wing) government.  
Ban Guns, Not Books! The prevalence of guns and a deeply ingrained (right-wing) gun culture in America leads inevitably to unnecessary deaths, from suicides to domestic violence and from street crime to mass shootings. 
Evidence-Based Case in Favor 
What started out as an effort to adjust Massachusetts state law to comply with the Supreme Court’s ruling in Bruen, ended up as a significant expansion of Massachusetts’s already expansive gun control regulations. 
Prior to the adoption of H. 4885, Massachusetts was ranked by the Giffords Law Center as having some of the strictest gun control laws in the country, with an assault weapons ban, universal license requirements, magazine capacity limits, safe storage regulations, and a so-called “red flag” law preventing people who pose a danger to themselves or others from having access to firearms.   
In 2023, Massachusetts also had the second lowest overall gun death rate in the country with one of the lowest gun homicide rates, too – a position it’s occupied for many years. 
To be sure, there is a correlation between strict gun laws and lower gun deaths, but it’s not clear that one is actually the cause of the other. Moreover, gun violence is a complex social phenomenon, affected by many, often inter-related factors. Importantly, gun violence is correlated with income and poverty, such that the states with higher per-capita income or lower poverty rates tend to have a lower gun death rate. And even though gun violence occurs everywhere, one recent study found that over 90 percent of all firearm-related hospitalizations of children and teens occurs in cities. 
Gun ownership rates are correlated with gun deaths, but some states with more restrictive gun laws have relatively high gun ownership rates and vice versa. For example, the Giffords Law Center gives both Oregon and Massachusetts an A- for their gun laws, but the estimated gun ownership rate in Oregon is over four times higher than Massachusetts.   
According to a Rand Corporation study, gun ownership rates declined steadily in almost all states from 1990 to 2016, including those with less restrictive gun control laws. Rand estimates that the percentage of adults living in households with guns dropped 14 percentage points from 1990 to 2016. The Massachusetts rate over the same period dropped 11 percentage points, while Arizona’s rate dropped 24 percentage points, even though its gun laws are among the least restrictive. 
A 2024 report by Rand finds that most rigorous research on gun control laws is inconclusive regarding their impact on violence and death. According to Rand, regulations that have been most effective include minimum age requirements for gun ownership and standards for preventing in-home child access to firearms. Other policies regarding background record checks, waiting periods, and prohibitions on gun access for people with restraining orders for domestic violence have credible evidence to support a finding of “moderate” impact. Regulations in all these areas have been part of Massachusetts law for years and are not affected by H. 4885. 
No matter how well-intentioned the supporters of H. 4885 are, the practical impact of the law is likely to be minimal, especially given the scope of pre-existing gun control laws in the Commonwealth and the already low rates of gun ownership.   
At the same time, the administrative and enforcement burdens created by the law’s provisions for registering serial numbers and restricting the use of 3-D printers are potentially onerous, intrusive and unworkable. Even the banning of “assault-style” weapons may prove unavailing in the face of the gun industry’s long track record of designing firearms that manage to stay at least one step ahead of the regulators. And involving school administrators and health care workers in proceedings to take guns away from people they think might be dangerous is more likely to lead to litigation, rather than greater safety. 
Evidence-Based Case Opposed 
Over the past five years more than 85 million guns have been manufactured in the United States or imported from abroad, and by one estimate there are over 390 million guns currently in circulation, about the twice the number in 2000. Since the onset of COVID-19, gun purchases have soared, with over 26 million new first-time gun owners since 2020. 
International surveys show the United States has, by far, the highest gun ownership rate of any other country, at 1.2 guns per person. By contrast, war-torn Yemen reportedly has a gun ownership rate of just over 0.5 per person. The United States is ranked sixth in the world when it comes to its rate of gun homicides, behind only Jamaica, Ecuador, Honduras, Belize, and Mexico. 
Numerous studies have confirmed a positive correlation between gun ownership rates and gun homicides. According to a 2013 study by Boston University researchers, every 1 percent increase in gun ownership is associated with a 0.9 percent increase in firearm homicides.  
Gun ownership is also strongly implicated in suicides. Almost 60 percent of all gun deaths in the United States are suicides. Over half of all suicides in the US are committed with a gun, accounting for over 27,000 deaths per year. In 2023, close to 150 people in Massachusetts committed suicide with a firearm.   
At the same time, there is a strong pattern of more restrictive gun laws being associated with relatively low levels of gun ownership and vice versa. The five states with the highest gun ownership rates have gun laws that are graded F, by the Giffords Law Center. Similarly, the five states with the lowest gun ownership rates have gun laws that are graded A or A-; they also happen to have the five lowest gun death rates. 
Massachusetts has one of the lowest levels of gun ownership and gun violence in the country, with fewer guns per capita than any state other than New Jersey and fewer gun deaths per capita than all states, except Rhode Island. A central reason for the relative safety of Massachusetts is the strength of its gun laws, which get an A grade from the Giffords Law Center, as high as any other state, thanks in part to the new provisions enacted in 2024. 
H. 4885 was narrowly targeted to address specific gaps in existing state laws that have emerged over the past several years. The Bruen decision weakened the ability of authorities to restrict gun access for people at risk of harming themselves or others, so the state’s “red flag” law needed to be strengthened to enable school administrators and health care professionals to report direct evidence of potential violent behavior. The growing popularity of 3-D printers and easy-to-assemble parts kits required an extension of licensure, registration, and serialization regulations to prevent evasion of “ghost gun” laws. And the development of new assault-style firearms that were not listed in the underlying 1998 statute required a shift to defining relevant gun features, rather than simply naming specific types of weapons. 
Certain specific gun control policies have stronger effects than others, such as those limiting gun access for minors or universal background checks and waiting periods. But it’s the combined impact of these and other policies, including those that are part of H. 4885, that’s generally more significant, creating multiple and overlapping obstacles to unsafe gun ownership and use that can address potentially deadly gaps in any one policy, while conveying a broader public health message that all guns need to be treated with extreme care and caution.  
Potential for Common Ground or Higher Ground 
Gun control advocates argue that firearms are inherently dangerous and therefore regulations on gun owners and their access to certain types of guns are essential for personal and public safety. Gun rights supporters, on the other hand, claim that these bureaucratic solutions are ineffective and only serve to burden law-abiding gun owners who do not pose any special risk to themselves or society. 
Of course, America is already awash in guns and there can be little dispute that they contribute to lethal violence, since they’re involved in over three-quarters of homicides and more than half of suicides. Even though Massachusetts has fewer than most other states, there are still about 100,000 gun owners in the Commonwealth, which translates into several hundred thousand guns. But this installed base of firearms isn’t going anywhere, nor is the right to purchase or manufacture even more guns, with or without state regulation – not to mention the illegal trafficking of guns from out of state.   
Where both sides might be able to agree is that policies should be considered to reduce gun violence, in terms of accidents, domestic violence, suicide, and criminal activity. Gun regulations and their enforcement alone cannot fully address these problems, although more robust and ongoing education and training in gun safety and violence prevention for all gun owners might help.   
Potential strategies to reduce gun violence that are not specifically about firearms include:  

quicker and stronger responses to incidents of domestic abuse, including counseling and supportive options for victims. 


more proactive interventions when there are early warning signs of a potential suicide. 


expansion of community policing, including greater uniformed police presence in neighborhoods with the highest concentrations of gun violence, complemented by ongoing civilian outreach and support for gang-affiliated or at-risk youth and expanded out-of-school-time educational and recreational resources.

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)A federal appeals court on Wednesday agreed with a Seattle judge’s decision to universally block President Donald Trump’s executive order restricting birthright citizenship.
The appeals judges ruled 2-1 that Trump’s order, issued on Inauguration Day, violates the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which states “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.”
“One power that the President was not granted, by Article II or by any other source, is the power to modify or change any clause of the United States Constitution,” Judge Ronald Gould, a Clinton appointee, wrote in his opinion.
Gould’s opinion, joined by Judge Michael Hawkins, sides with U.S. District Court Judge John Coughenour who stopped Trump’s order with an indefinite preliminary injunction in February. Such orders block enforcement while the case proceeds through the courts.
Coughenour called Trump’s order “blatantly unconstitutional.” The lawsuit was brought by Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Illinois and two pregnant noncitizen women who feared their children could be born without citizenship in any country.
In a statement, Washington Attorney General Nick Brown applauded the appeals court ruling.
“The court agrees that the president cannot redefine what it means to be American with the stroke of a pen,” Brown said. “He cannot strip away the rights, liberties, and protections of children born in our country.”
The decision from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals adds to the list of courts that have found Trump’s move unconstitutional and blocked enforcement of it. The ruling comes after the Department of Justice and Washington attorney general’s office argued the case in early June.
Since those arguments, the U.S. Supreme Court decided judges like Coughenour had overstepped their authority in blocking Trump’s order nationwide. The justices ruled nationwide injunctions should be limited to when necessary to “provide complete relief to each plaintiff.”
The high court’s decision left the door open for a checkerboard of states where birthright citizenship remained and others where it didn’t.
The justices didn’t take up the merits of Trump’s order.
Wednesday’s ruling is the second to confirm a complete block is necessary since the Supreme Court decision, after a New Hampshire federal judge certified a nationwide class action suit. 
The Trump administration looks to define “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” as only covering people whose primary allegiance is to the United States. So people born to parents only here temporarily or without legal status wouldn’t qualify for citizenship at birth.  
In 2022, about 153,000 babies across the country were born to two parents without legal immigration status, including 4,000 in Washington, according to the plaintiffs. The states have said they stand to lose federal funding through programs like Medicaid that otherwise could help these children if they were citizens.
Gould found this argument persuasive, justifying “complete relief” to block the order nationwide. He wrote that Trump’s birthright citizenship order would require states to overhaul their eligibility verification systems for social service programs.
“The preliminary injunction here merely prevents the Executive Branch from denying citizenship to individuals who are likely constitutionally entitled to citizenship,” Gould wrote. “Because, as the district court correctly concluded, the Executive Branch does not have a legitimate interest in violating the Constitution, the Executive Branch has not shown that either the public interest or the balance of equities tips in its favor.”
Judge Patrick Bumatay, a Trump appointee, disagreed, arguing the states lack standing to bring litigation over the order because their financial loss would be a “self-inflicted injury” if they choose to provide benefits to immigrants without legal status.
In his dissent, Bumatay didn’t address the issue of the injunction’s scope.

Forrest Dunbar, D-Anchorage, speaks in favor of Senate Bill 39, a bill to address payday loans, on Tuesday, April 15, 2025. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Anchorage Democratic Sen. Forrest Dunbar will be able to attend the Aug. 2 special session of the Alaska Legislature, he said late Tuesday in a post on Facebook.
Dunbar, a member of the National Guard, is deployed to Poland on active-duty service but received a federal waiver that will allow him to return to Alaska for legislative work.
Dunbar’s attendance is critical for lawmakers who hope to override Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s decision to veto millions of dollars in public school funding from this year’s state operating budget. Despite his attendance, the outcome remains uncertain, and Dunleavy has the option of canceling the session.
It takes 45 votes to override an Alaska governor’s budget veto, and Dunbar was one of 46 legislators who voted in May to reverse the governor’s decision to veto a bill increasing the state’s public school funding formula.
That formula is subject to the state’s annual budget process, and Dunleavy chose to only partially fund it, causing a wave of cuts to services at public schools across the state. Dunleavy had said he would not agree to the full funding increase without the Legislature adopting other policies he’s proposed.
Many legislators hoped to override that second veto in January, when the regular legislative session reconvenes, but Dunleavy called a special session for Aug. 2, forcing an early vote.
Writing on Facebook, Dunbar noted that he had previously requested to be excused from the Legislature during his National Guard service, “however, the Legislature obviously does not control the actions of the governor.”
Dunbar said he began seeking a formal waiver that would allow him to use his personal leave, pay for his own plane ticket, and return to the state for the special session.
“I am pleased to report that the commanding general to whom our unit now reports has indeed granted that request,” Dunbar wrote. “I plan to return to Alaska for the start of the special session, and I will be voting yes to override, so that our students have the funds they need to avoid catastrophic cuts to their schools.”
For weeks, it hadn’t been clear whether Dunbar would be able to obtain the rare dispensation needed to return to Alaska.
“In general, a service member on federal Title 10 mobilization orders is required to complete the full term of their deployment,” said Dana Rosso, a spokesperson for the Alaska National Guard, by email. “Any early release or temporary return would require approval through Department of Defense and U.S. Army channels and is only considered under exceptional circumstances — such as serious medical or family emergencies — while taking mission requirements and federal law into account.”
Rosso said there was no way for a state official — such as the governor or adjutant general — to issue the waiver.
“Any early release or temporary return would require approval through Department of Defense channels, typically at the Secretary of the Army or Secretary of Defense level,” he said. “These waivers are rare and only considered under extraordinary circumstances, such as serious medical issues, family emergencies, or extreme humanitarian situations.”
Dunbar’s chief of staff, Arielle Wiggin, said by email that it wasn’t clear until recently whether the commanding general of the U.S. Army’s V Corps — Lt. Gen. Charles Costanza — would grant the waiver.
Even with Dunbar’s attendance, it isn’t clear whether the governor’s budget veto will be overridden or sustained. 
In a closed-door meeting shortly after issuing a proclamation that called the session, Dunleavy asked members of the House’s Republican minority caucus to stay away from the first five days of the special session, the period when the Alaska Constitution requires any override vote to take place.
The date of the special session also coincides with the National Conference of State Legislatures, which several lawmakers were expected to attend.
Other legislators were scheduled to work or attend family events during the period.
Since the governor’s announcement, many have said they will be canceling their plans in order to attend the special session. Sen. James Kaufman, R-Anchorage, will return from a trip to Vietnam, he said, and vote in favor of the override.
Some Republicans aligned with Dunleavy on the issue, including Reps. Jamie Allard, R-Eagle River, and Kevin McCabe, R-Big Lake, have said they will follow his wishes and stay away.
Of the 46 legislators who voted this spring to override the governor’s veto of the education funding formula, all but a handful have committed to supporting a budget veto override as well.
Rep. Dan Saddler, R-Eagle River, said he will attend the special session but declined to say how he would vote on the budget issue. House Minority Leader Mia Costello, R-Anchorage, said she has not made up her mind. 
Republican Reps. Julie Coulombe and David Nelson of Anchorage, and Bill Elam of Nikiski, could not be reached by phone on Wednesday. 
The governor’s legislative director is keeping close track of the number of potential “yes” and “no” votes for a veto override, and it is possible that the governor could cancel the special session.

Video provided by FIRE.An Allentown man filed a civil lawsuit on Wednesday after a police officer drove a cruiser at him on the sidewalk, according to the complaint. Phil Rishel, 25, is being represented by attorneys from the free speech organization, Freedom of Individual Rights and Expression, or FIRE.
The lawsuit names the city of Allentown and two police officers, Sgt. Christopher Stephenson and now-retired Officer Dean Flyte.
Listen to Ian and Emily’s audio recap here: 

https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/23epikFIRESUIT.mp3
 
The Allentown mayor’s office, the city’s chief of police and the assistant chief of police did not respond to multiple emails from the Capital-Star requesting additional information.
A video apparently taken by Rishel and released by FIRE shows Rishel standing on the sidewalk beside a “no trespassing” sign outside a local police precinct.
“That’s a nice sign. Too bad it doesn’t apply to the public sidewalk,” Rishel says from behind the camera. The video then cuts and shows a marked SUV emerging from the parking lot and driving onto the sidewalk towards Rishel.

“You just f–king hit your own building, you dumb piece of s—,” Rishel says as the cruiser appears to scrape the wall of the lot’s entrance.
The video shows the SUV’s sirens blare as it continues towards Rishel, who puts a lamppost between himself and the car. The officer then drives around the post, back onto the sidewalk, and continues towards Rishel. The lawsuit alleges the vehicle was driven by Flyte, who the lawsuit says retired later last year.
Zach Silver, an attorney with FIRE, said the video was cut down from more than an hour of footage taken by Rishel on March 26, 2024, when the alleged incident took place, and March 27, 2024, when, according to the lawsuit, Rishel was charged with loitering and disorderly conduct.
Footage from the second day appears to show Rishel back at the police precinct and continuing to film. An officer, identified in the lawsuit as Stephenson, threatens him with citation or arrest and says, “you’re not protesting. You’re being a nuisance.”
Both charges were ultimately dropped or dismissed on appeal.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
According to Rishel, he’d made a habit of filming the Allentown police from the sidewalk outside their precincts beginning in 2023. On his near-daily bike rides, he would sometimes stop outside police precincts and pull out his cellphone. 
It was a form of protest against what he claims is a pattern of excessive force and First Amendment violations by the department.
“There were several incidents with the Allentown Police Department that just really made me realize there was a larger issue going on,” Rishel told the Capital-Star.

He cited the city’s $400,000 settlement with a man named John Perez, who was allegedly beaten and had his nose broken by officers. All charges against Perez, who was accused of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, were dropped.
There was also a 2015 lawsuit brought by Eli Heckman, who said he was shoved to the ground by an officer after filming police use a stun gun on another man.
“That’s what made me want to go out there and take the protest to their doorstep, their police department building, and let them know that they’re being scrutinized,” Rishel said.
Often, Rishel said, it was uneventful, and a number of officers were friendly.
But other officers, he said, would blare sirens or shine spotlights at him. At least once, he had his home address shouted at him.
March 26th, the day an officer allegedly drove a car at him, was Rishel’s first time filming outside the 10th street precinct, which he was passing on his bike.
“It was just shocking,” Rishel said. “I’d had bad experiences before, but never anything like that.”
After the incident, Rishel received a summons saying he’d been charged with loitering and disorderly conduct. The disorderly conduct charge was dismissed and the loitering charge was ultimately overturned by the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas.
“While I was fighting the criminal charges I went back to the main Allentown station just to let them know they didn’t scare me off,” Rishel said. “ I didn’t want to set the precedent that you could get people to stop protesting by criminally charging them.”
Rishel then reached out to several advocacy organizations like FIRE and the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania. FIRE responded first. 
Rishel has stopped his filming since getting involved with the organization on the advice of his lawyer
“Any interaction could influence the case,” Rishel said. “We’re kind of playing it safe at this point.”

Silver, the FIRE attorney, said the civil lawsuit has three goals: compensation for Rishel, a recognition of his right to record video, and to require the city of Allentown to train officers on citizens’ First Amendment rights.
Silver said that FIRE filed a Freedom of Information request for documents with the department seeking materials used to train officers on First Amendment rights, free speech activities, protest rights and filming or photography. A response from the city, shared with the Capital-Star, said no such materials existed, but that the Pennsylvania Municipal Police Officers’ Education and Training Commission may have them.
Neither the police chief nor the mayor’s office responded to questions from the Capital-Star about the department’s training regimen.
“It’s not just the right to record. It’s not just the right to film police officers,” Silver said. “Police officers can’t stop someone from speaking just because they don’t like what they say.”
The civil lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court and a jury trial was requested.

Beshear is a Democratic governor in a deeply red Republican state. He and other 2028 potential presidential hopefuls visited South Carolina in recent weeks, to test the water for their campaign messages.
He was picked to lead the Democratic Governors Association into next year’s midterm elections and has been touted as “most popular Democratic governor in America.” Beshear was attorney general of Kentucky before becoming governor in 2019. His father was previously governor.
National Democrats have been seeking answers as President Donald Trump made gains among working-class voters, including minority voters, last year. A trend of prominent Democratic figures making their way to the heartland has emerged, and some are crossing the Missouri River from traditionally first-in-the-nation Iowa into Nebraska.
Independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders launched his “Fighting Oligarchy” nationwide tour in Omaha. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz hosted a Democratic town hall earlier this year And Former Texas U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke is having a similar town hall in Omaha next month.

Nebraska could regain the national spotlight in 2026, with an open seat race in the state’s 2nd District for the U.S. House and Dan Osborn’s nonpartisan Senate bid against Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts. Both races could determine which party controls what parts of Congress.

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The general manager of the Lower Platte South Natural Resources District has resigned the $178,000-a-year position a month after being placed on suspension with pay.
Mike Sousek, who had served in the general manager’s role the past two years, did not return messages left seeking comment.
In June, the NRD’s board of directors had placed Sousek on paid leave pending a review by the board. A week ago, after a nearly hour-long closed-door session, the board voted to “approve the strategy discussed in closed session” regarding Sousek.
The chairman of the Lower Platte South NRD Board, Bob Anderson, declined to explain what that vote actually meant, but told the Examiner it was “timely” that the news site had called and that Sousek had now resigned the post.
“We thank him for his service, and we wish him well,” Anderson told a reporter.
He declined to say when exactly Sousek had resigned and whether it included any kind of financial payment.
“I’ve gone as far as we want to go,” Anderson said, stating that it was a personnel matter.
The suspension and resignation comes on the heels of the settlement of a lawsuit with a female NRD employee who maintained that she was bypassed for the NRD’s top job — when Sousek was hired — because she was a woman.
McKenzie Barry, who had worked for the Lower Platte South NRD for 22 years, filed the sex discrimination lawsuit, claiming, among other things, that two members of the committee interviewing candidates told her the NRD wasn’t ready to have a female in the top job.
Barry left the NRD in January. She said Sousek ordered her to clear out her desk a day prior to her last scheduled work day. The Lincoln-based NRD appointed its assistant general manager, David Potter, in June to take over temporarily as general manager.
The Lower Platte South NRD covers six counties in southeast Nebraska. It operates nine wildlife management areas and maintains 50 miles of recreational trails. It also works with landowners to reduce erosion and manage groundwater use.

A 115-year-old canal in the Yakima-Tieton Irrigation District that was severely damaged during the Rimrock Retreat Fire last year is now at imminent risk of failure.
Fixing the 12-mile waterway will cost an estimated $229 million and involve work spread over more than a decade. But if the canal suddenly goes out of service, officials say it could cause up to $3 billion in losses over three years for 35,000 acres of farms and 28,000 acres of orchards in the Yakima Valley that are part of the irrigation district. 
Surrounding communities also rely on the canal to deliver water to fire hydrants and other municipal fire suppression systems.
The irrigation district has tapped $5 million in county, state and federal funds to help extend the life of the canal, and the two-year capital budget the Legislature approved this year included an additional $8.5 million for repairs and improvements. 
While those funds will keep water flowing for now, the deteriorating state of the canal and the high risk of a catastrophic failure mean the canal needs to be replaced as soon as possible. 
Construction would take place outside the growing season over the course of 15 years, with $15.3 million paid per year.  
The Yakima-Tieton Irrigation District has committed $80 million through a 30-year bond and is looking for other sources, including state and federal funding, to pay for the rest of the project. 
“We’re trying to figure out how to put all this together, because this is a massive project that our district cannot shoulder alone,” said Travis Okelberry, district manager of the Yakima-Tieton Irrigation District, during a tour of the Rimrock Retreat Fire area this week. 
“The canal delivers a river’s supply of water to an otherwise arid valley … If this canal system fails, it will absolutely devastate the Yakima Valley,” Okelberry said. 
The Yakima-Tieton Irrigation District has been working on a plan to replace the aging canal since 2013 and approved a gravity-fed boxed culvert design as its preferred alternative in 2024. 
As the irrigation district was working on a project plan, however, the Rimrock Retreat Fire broke out. 
The fire started at a Rimrock Retreat cabin in July of last year and burned roughly 46,601 acres between Rimrock Lake and Tieton in the Yakima Valley over a month. 
The full length of the canal was in the burn area. 
“There were logs and trees and boulders crashing into, on top of, and rolling down through our canal system. It tore apart the inside of the canal. There’s massive spalling and heat damage to the outside of the canal,” Okelberry said. 
The weakened integrity of the concrete has led to more leaks, with canal patrolmen documenting over 2,000 active leaks as of last week, Okelberry said. 
“We’ve done our best to seal them up during the off season,” he said. 
The fire also significantly increased the risk of landslides, debris flows and runoff on the hillside above the canal. 
As mild as this spring’s rainfall was, Department of Natural Resources Recovery Program Manager Colin Haffey said that, without the normal vegetation to slow the flow of water through the watershed, they saw dangerous amounts of water flow over the top of the canal this year. 
Debris flows after Mount St. Helens erupted in 1980 buried a mile-long section of the canal. A thunderstorm that occurred shortly after that debris flow further clogged the canal with ash and mud from the eruption, which caused a large section of the canal to flood and peel away from the hillside. 
To prevent a repeat of those problems and help mitigate damage throughout the burn area, the Department of Natural Resources’ wildfire-associated landslide emergency response team completed a geological survey of the Rimrock Retreat Fire area in September 2024. 
The survey determined the areas most prone to landslides, flash floods and debris flows after the fire, as well as areas that would be most beneficial to monitor with trail cameras or flood sensors for early hazard detection.

The survey team focused primarily on assessing the dangers to people and infrastructure, including the canal and Highway 12. 
Based on the findings of the survey, the Yakima-Tieton Irrigation District spent $2 million this year to cover 12,000 feet of the canal in landslide-prone areas. 
That funding was part of a total of $5 million for immediate repairs and improvements to mitigate future damage. 
The irrigation district, Yakima County and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, as well as the state Department of Natural Resources, Department of Commerce and Department of Ecology all contributed funds. 
Repairing and fortifying the canal has been a primary focus of Rimrock Retreat Fire recovery efforts due to its value to the surrounding community. 
“There’s no difference between the built environment of this canal and the natural environment of this watershed. Both are critical to the community,” Haffey said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9179-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-23 20:56:14.179723

She’d seen it coming. Her landlord had been in the news in recent months for falling behind on the property’s water bill by more than $400,000. 
JXN Water, the city’s privately operated water utility, had indicated water shutoffs at Blossom and other complexes with delinquent accounts were possible but not imminent.  Smith and her neighbors found their taps dry Wednesday – a sweltering summer day reaching 97 degrees.

Anticipating this could happen, Smith had filled up her bathtub and pots with water, allowing her to at least flush the toilet. She planned to visit her mother’s home a few miles up the street to bathe.
Blossom Apartments LLC owner Tony Little, whose trouble with JXN Water dates back at least a year, did not respond to a call or email from Mississippi Today Wednesday afternoon, but the Louisiana-based businessman told WLBT in 2024 that he rejected the company’s assessment of what he owed. 
JXN Water interim third-party manager Ted Henifin retorted, telling WLBT this week, “He has to pay his bill.”
Water is not the only issue at Blossom, a 72-unit property initially built in 2004 through low-income housing tax credits administered by the state to offer affordable rents to Jackson residents. Smith has lived there for nearly a year and a half, and said she’s been plagued with problems such as faulty air conditioning units and black mold in her apartment. 
“Now we’re suffering,” said Smith, 50. “What are we going to do? We’ve been paying. What are y’all doing with our money?”

To her, the water shutoff underscores the issue of poor management. She said the property managers are only accessible on the days rental payments are due. 
“They don’t come to the office. They ain’t answer no letters. They ain’t knock on no doors. They ain’t tell us nothing,” Smith said. 
Earlier this year, JXN Water released a list of multi-family accounts that had more than $100,000 in unpaid water fees. Blossom was on the list. JXN Water was not able to provide a comment as of press time.
Smith said she receives a housing voucher from the U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department for $543 a month. But now without water, she doesn’t want to pay her portion of the $800 rent, which is also supposed to cover water. She didn’t pay her June or July rent after learning that the water was at risk of being shut off. Earlier this month, she and others who didn’t pay received a notice to submit rent within three days or face an eviction filing in court.
Smith said she’s planning to move from Blossom to another Jackson apartment complex within the next couple of weeks. 
“They don’t care,” she said. “When you try to be nice, they don’t care. I’m disabled. I don’t need this.”

Lillie Wilcher, another resident of Blossom Apartments, said she would move if she could, but it’s too expensive. 
“How can we find somewhere else to go if we’re having to keep paying rent over here?” Wilcher asked. “I’m disabled. I live check to check. It don’t make sense. How will we find somewhere else to go?”
When she first moved to the complex about eight months ago, Wilcher said she didn’t have a refrigerator for months, which is a necessity for her since she needs to keep her insulin cold. But she soon traded one problem for another – once maintenance got her a fridge, her stove went out. 
“It’s just hectic over here. It’s depressing, and I’m ready to go,” Wilcher said. “I’ve been trying so hard to find somewhere else to go.” 
Now, without water, she planned to go to the nearby grocery store to stockpile bottled water. She has to have water for an oxygen machine when she sleeps. 
“It’s too hot to be here,” Wilcher said. “It’s getting hotter. It’s too hot to be without water.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/23170449/3X0A8794-1.jpg,,,2025-07-23 20:56:14.179723

(Photo: Greg Childress)Durham government officials and advocates for immigrants on Wednesday condemned the presence of four plainclothes Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at the Durham County Courthouse to detain a man due to make his first court appearance.   
The agents’ presence was reported around 9:30 a.m., to Siembra NC, a grassroots immigrant advocacy group, by an anonymous “community member.” The unnamed man due in court never appeared, the group reported. Siembra leaders said it has information suggesting that agents will return to the courthouse on Thursday.
“From what we know, ICE came to try to detain someone before they could have a first appearance in court,” said Andrew Willis Garcés, an organizer with Siembra NC. “This is someone with a first appearance at court, not someone with a conviction. And so obviously, ICE does not care about the rule of law, about due process, about public safety, which is cultivated at the local level.”
In a statement, Kelly Morales, Siembra NC’s co-director, said the group will stand with Durham.
“That’s why we plan to have our people show up to Durham County Courthouse tomorrow morning to do what we can to preserve justice for everyone in our communities,” Morales said. “And we are calling on elected officials and leaders throughout our state to ask themselves if they’re doing everything they can to do the same.”
Morales said the group’s “ICE Watch” program is quickly becoming a “court watch program” as ICE agents begin to appear at courthouses with more frequency.
Since the beginning of the year, the group has trained nearly 2,000 people for its ICE Watch program across multiple counties, Siembra leaders said. The program was created in response to increased ICE-led detentions in Wake, Durham, Mecklenburg and Guilford counties, they said.

Durham officials and others who gathered outside of the courthouse Wednesday for a news conference said the report of ICE agents sent a chill through immigrant communities
Such tactics spread fear and erode trust, they said.
“When agents show up in plain clothes to detain someone with a scheduled court appearance, it sends a clear message that immigrant communities are not safe anywhere,” said Durham Board of County Commissioners Chairwoman Nida Allam.
Allam said a young immigrant couple who planned to get married Wednesday changed their minds after they learned ICE agents had been at the courthouse.
“We don’t know what their citizenship status is, we didn’t ask, but the fact is, that even if they were citizens, they don’t feel safe,” Allam said. “It instills a fear in community members who look different, who have black or brown skin, that they are under threat of being detained.”
Allam, a naturalized citizen with dual citizenship in Canada and the U.S., said she feels threatened at times due to Trump administration policies targeting immigrants for deportation.
“In Trump 1 [Trump’s first administration] we saw the targeting of Black and brown communities but what we see now is Trump 1 times 100,” Allam said. “Under this new administration, there’s no one who seems to be safe.”
  Durham County school board member Natalie Beyer (Photo: https://www.dpsnc.net/)
Durham school board member Natalie Beyer noted that the district’s year-round schools started this week. Beyer said the fear and distrust generated by targeting immigrants “ripples” through the schools.
“Children have a constitutional right to education in this country,” Beyer said. “We need to make sure that families feel safe in our schools, in our clinics and our courthouses and our public spaces so that they can take care of their families and no live in fear.”
Beyer said some families are afraid to allow their children to walk to schools. She said the district has begun to hold more events virtually instead of in person to ease the fears of immigrant families uncomfortable being around police officers.   
The Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL) called Wednesday’s incident “disturbing” and the latest in increased ICE activity across North Carolina and the South. The group noted the recent detention of Mohamed Ali Aboubaker Naser, a father of five in Greensboro who it contends is in the country legally. Naser’s attorney said her client also holds a valid visa.
“These courthouse ambushes are not isolated events,” said Nicole Drapluk with the PSL. “They are part of a broader strategy of intimidation and repression targeting immigrant communities across the South, especially in North Carolina.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Image-1-1024x863.jpeg,,,2025-07-23 20:56:14.179723

(Pool photo by Francisco Kjolseth/The Salt Lake Tribune) A judge will soon decide whether Ralph Menzies, the death row inmate with dementia sentenced to die by firing squad on Sept. 5, will get another evaluation to determine whether he’s mentally competent to be executed. 
Utah’s 3rd District Judge Matthew Bates heard arguments for and against granting Menzies another evaluation on Wednesday — after about 45 minutes, Bates said he was taking the issue under advisement and would issue a ruling “as quickly as possible.” 
“I know time is ticking,” Bates said. 
If Bates grants Menzies another review, it could kick off a 60-day process where a medical professional examines the inmate and compiles a report for the court — depending on the report’s findings, Menzies could be found incompetent, and spared from execution. 
Menzies is 67 years old and has been on death row since 1988, after being convicted of kidnapping and murdering Maurine Hunsaker. But the question of whether his dementia makes him mentally incompetent to be executed has proven to be a hurdle for Utah prosecutors. 
Both state and federal law require that death row inmates have an understanding of why they’re being executed.
Utah corrections officials say they’ll be ready to execute Ralph Menzies by firing squad

So far, the state has mostly cleared that hurdle — after a competency hearing that began in November, Bates ruled in June that Menzies does have dementia, but is still competent.
Now, Menzies’ attorneys are arguing that his dementia has worsened since the evaluations that Bates used to make his ruling, which were performed last year.  In a petition filed on July 7, they asked the court to grant Menzies another evaluation from a Utah Department of Health and Human Services doctor. 
Expert evaluations commissioned by his attorneys have shown Menzies’ cognitive abilities are in decline and he’s lost his ability to “engage in relatively coherent and adult conversations,” and he now speaks in “simplistic and immature terms,” according to court documents. 
“Most important before this court is the declaration of his case manager who said, ‘look, I’ve seen a big change.’ If that alone does not raise the question whether a further evaluation is warranted, then what can?” said Eric Zuckerman, Menzies’ attorney, who noted that his case manager is a Utah Department of Corrections employee. 
“She’s the person that talks to him the most. She’s his case manager. That’s her job. And she says, ‘I’ve seen a substantial decline. I talk to him and he’s not really there,’” Zuckerman said. 
State code would give the doctor 60 days to compile a report. 
“Set a hearing for the 61st day and bring it in, let’s hear the testimony on it. If the court finds him competent, then issue (an execution) warrant,” Zuckerman said. 
Daniel Boyer with the Utah Attorney General’s Office said the petition for another evaluation was “inadequate.”
A petition should point to a change in circumstances and raise “significant” questions about Menzies’ competency, Boyer told the court Wednesday — the petition, he said, relies on “mere allegations.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“I think we need more context to really fully understand,” Boyer said. 
Boyer also said the state is in possession of 13 phone calls made by Menzies since May that challenge the argument that he’s mentally incompetent. 
“They are highly relevant to this determination, and only further confirm our belief that he cannot raise a significant issue,” Boyer said. 
Matt Hunsaker, Maurine’s son, addressed the court on Wednesday and questioned the sincerity of Menzies’ claim of incompetency. 
“Is this just all a game?” he said. “This man, we’ve got to remember, is educated. He’s not stupid. … Let’s just get this over with.” 
Menzies was convicted of murder in 1988 after he kidnapped Hunsaker, a 26-year-old gas station clerk, and took her up Big Cottonwood Canyon where she was later found tied to a tree with her throat slashed.
Menzies has spent decades on death row, and in recent years his health has deteriorated. After falling several times in prison he was diagnosed with vascular dementia, caused when the brain’s blood flow is disrupted, leading to memory loss and declining cognitive function, according to court testimony. An MRI exam showed Menzies’ brain tissue is deteriorating. 
Last week, the Utah Department of Corrections said it will be ready to carry out the execution, which is set for Sept 5. 
In Utah, death row inmates sentenced before May 2004 had a choice between lethal injection or firing squad. Menzies, when he was sentenced in 1988, chose the firing squad. For those sentenced after 2004, the default method of execution is lethal injection, unless the necessary drugs are not available.

(Photo by Nicole Morton/For the North Dakota Monitor)A North Dakota truck stop wants a federal judge to find that the Federal Reserve Board violated the law by neglecting to crack down on mushrooming debit card transaction fees.
The fees — which apply every time someone swipes their debit card — are meant to reimburse banks for the cost of processing transactions. But for years, banks increased these fees to an extent that far exceeded those costs.
Congress decided to pass a law reining in banks after it learned that they were making billions off of the fees annually. The law — commonly referred to as the Durbin Amendment after U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. — was adopted in 2010 as part of a package of consumer protection reforms that followed the 2008 financial crisis.
The statute instructs the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to regulate the fees in a way that is “reasonable and proportional” to the cost of processing debit card purchases.
The Corner Post — a truck stop and convenience store near Watford City — says the regulation adopted by the board did not make good on this directive. Its lawsuit, filed in 2021, accuses the board of twisting the law in a way that allows banks to continue to enrich themselves off the transaction fees.
Meanwhile, Corner Post says it still has to shoulder unreasonably high costs related to debit cards. It claims it paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in transaction fees between 2018 and 2021.
“Congress’ demand to this day still stands unfilled,” Tyler Green, an attorney representing the truck stop, said in a Wednesday hearing in federal court in Bismarck.
Corner Post wants a federal judge to declare the rule unlawful and have the Board of Governors rewrite it. The truck stop hopes that a new regulation would leave small business owners with more money in their pockets.
The Board of Governors says it faithfully interpreted the law and has successfully brought the transaction fees down. Attorneys for the board argue that Corner Post is calling for the fees to be regulated far more aggressively than the law permits.
“The board’s already cut, through its rule, the fees by half,” said Joshua Chadwick, an attorney representing the Board of Governors.
Both parties during the hearing asked U.S. District Court Judge Dan Traynor to decide the case in their favor. Traynor could choose to grant either party’s request or decide that elements of the case should go to trial.
According to Corner Post, Congress wanted to minimize the fees as much as possible to make them comparable to the cost-free way paper checks are processed. But data collected and published by the board indicates that banks still make large profit margins off of the fees, Green said.
The Board of Governors’ rule allows banks to charge up to 21 cents for all debit card transactions, regardless of how much it actually costs for them to process each sale. It also permits banks to charge an additional fee of .05% per transaction to make up for losses caused by debit card fraud. The rule only applies to banks with at least $10 billion in assets.
Corner Post says this structure misinterprets the Durbin Amendment. Congress wanted the board to create a fee structure that isn’t one-size-fits-all, but individualized for each debit card transaction and each bank, Green said.
The truck stop also argues that the fees created by the board compensate banks for more things than they’re supposed to — including technology infrastructure, fraud prevention and other costs. These fall outside the scope of what the Durbin Amendment envisioned the fees to cover, Green said. 
Chadwick countered that Congress gave the board broad discretion over how to write the rule. He also said that, given how complex debit card transactions are, there’s no way to write a regulation in the targeted way Corner Post is proposing.
Judson Littleton — an attorney representing the Bank Policy Institute and Clearing House Association — said the fees should be higher. 
Congress meant for the fees to cover both the cost of the transaction and to allow the banks to have a rate of return, said Littleton, who participated in the hearing as a third party. He said many banks lose money on debit card transactions.
“Why would Congress want to regulate it in such a way that the cost of each transaction resulted in a profit for the bank?” Traynor asked.
Traynor said that these costs are still being transferred to businesses and consumers.
“At the end of the day, we’re here because those fees are coming out of Corner Post’s pocket,” he said. 
Traynor said he would take the matter under advisement.
Supreme Court case
The U.S. Supreme Court weighed in on the Corner Post lawsuit last year.
The case was originally filed in 2021 by two professional associations: the North Dakota Retail Association and the North Dakota Petroleum Marketers Association. Corner Post — a member of both groups — later joined as a plaintiff.
Traynor in 2022 dismissed the case, finding that the three plaintiffs didn’t have standing to bring the lawsuit because there’s a six-year statute of limitations on challenging a federal rule under the Administrative Procedures Act. The rule was adopted back in 2011.
The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling, but the Supreme Court in 2024 found that the clock on the statute of limitations does not start ticking until a plaintiff is first harmed by a rule. The high court decided that Corner Post had standing to bring the lawsuit because it didn’t open until 2018, and sent the case back to continue on the district court level.

Morial Convention Center in New Orleans will be paid a base salary of $410,000 per year, with the ability to earn a bonus worth up to $25,000, according to records from the convention center oversight board that have been posted online. 
Jim Cook, who is leaving a job as the general manager of the Sheraton New Orleans, was given a five-year contract last month to run the public entity charged with attracting major events to the city, according to the board documents. The position is one of the most important tourism and economic development jobs in the state. 

Cook’s base salary will be higher than the one given to the convention center’s last permanent CEO Michael Sawaya in 2023, according to the most recent audit from the state. At the time, Sawaya’s salary was $357,000, according to the state documents. He left the job to lead the Audubon Nature Institute in late 2024. 
Cook was first named CEO in February, but Gov. Jeff Landry and legislators also needed to change a state anti-corruption law before Cook could take the job. He wasn’t officially voted into the position until last month. 
Cook has served as one of Landry appointees on the convention center’s governing board that hires and manages the CEO as recently as June. State law prohibits state board members from taking a government post their board oversees. 
The exception carved out for Cook was tailored specifically for him. It allows a Morial Convention Center commissioner to be the facility’s CEO, but only if they have “30 years of work experience in hotel and hospitality management,” and served on the board on Jan. 1, 2025. 

A summary of Cook’s compensation package included in board materials says he will receive health, dental and vision insurance as well as retirement, disability insurance and paid time off, though details and  value of these benefits wasn’t provided.

The recent convention center audit shows Sawaya received all those benefits as well as a car allowance ($10,000), travel budget ($13,900) and cell phone stipend ($900) in 2023. About $2,500 worth of meals, parking and entertainment were also covered for him that year. 
Most of the money for the convention center operations, including the CEO’s compensation, comes from taxes on hotel rooms and sales of food and beverage in New Orleans. 

The state controls the governance of the convention center. Ten of its board appointees serve at the discretion of the governor and the New Orleans mayor picks the remaining three. Board members serve four-year terms.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4859-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-23 19:57:06.121810

(Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Genetic seafood testing at restaurants in the Houma area last week found one-third of the sampled businesses serving foreign shrimp, though most were upfront about it with their customers.
SeaD Consulting, a food testing company that has made headlines for uncovering foreign-sourced shrimp sold fraudulently as local catch at restaurants and festivals across the Gulf Coast, announced Wednesday that eight out of 24 restaurants sampled in Terrebonne Parish, or 33%, were serving foreign shrimp. Three of those restaurants misled their customers about it, failing to disclose the shrimp’s country of origin either on the menu or on a sign inside the establishment as required under state law, according to SeaD’s news release. 
The Houma area’s 13% fraud rate over the July 13-15 period is one of the lowest in the state, tying New Orleans. It’s also much lower than markets that don’t have mislabeling laws, such as Tampa, Florida, where SeaD uncovered a 96% shrimp fraud rate from a sample of 44 restaurants in January.
Despite the relative honesty among Terrebonne Parish eateries, SeaD Consulting’s undercover testing, which it began last year, has discovered shrimp fraud in every city and batch of restaurants sampled. 
“This is about integrity,” Al Mahler, owner of Big Al’s Seafood Restaurant in Houma, said in the news release. “My kitchen serves wild-caught Louisiana shrimp because that’s what we believe in. People don’t come here for shortcuts — they come for tradition, flavor, and trust.”
In December, the Louisiana Shrimp Task Force, an advisory panel for the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, asked SeaD Consulting to analyze shrimp from restaurants across the state in an effort to eliminate consumer seafood fraud. Its analysis includes sampling 24 randomly selected restaurants in different metropolitan areas across the state.
It is illegal under federal and state law to mislabel imported seafood as local and can result in fines or other penalties.
Local seafood was once easy to find in Louisiana, but an influx of cheap foreign catch — particularly shrimp and crawfish — has flooded the market over the past two decades. 
For more than a decade, Louisiana law has specifically required restaurants and other food establishments to state on their menus the country of origin of any shrimp and crawfish being served. The same requirement applies to food vendors at fairs and festivals. 
There have been 2,600 violations of Louisiana’s imported shrimp law — and no fines

A 2023 review of state enforcement records revealed many restaurants had not complied with the law. State health inspectors issued thousands of citations to restaurants but levied no fines against them, drawing criticism from state lawmakers and local fishermen.
SeaD Consulting launched its testing efforts last year using undercover inspectors to purchase shrimp dishes from restaurants and festival vendors. The inspectors run the shrimp through a rapid field testing kit that examines seafood tissue genetics. 
The company does not publicly disclose the names of the restaurants that fraudulently serve imported shrimp, opting instead to highlight businesses that are following the law and serve domestic shrimp. 
The Terrebonne Parish restaurants tested that offer locally caught seafood are:

Quantum technology is a major pillar of the state’s economic development plans. 
The post State-backed quantum park plan expands with new company, computer appeared first on Capitol News Illinois","Article Summary

Quantum computing company Infleqtion will open an office in Illinois and build a quantum computer on Chicago’s South Side.
Infleqtion is expected to receive at least a $5 million tax credit through a state program meant to incentivize microchip manufacturing and quantum computing.
The quantum research park project has received significant incentives, grants and tax breaks, including more than $700 million from the state.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story. 

CHICAGO — Another company is joining the state-backed research and business facility on Chicago’s South Side.
Colorado-based Infleqtion, will set up shop at the Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park, or IQMP. There, they plan to build a “neutral atom” quantum computer and expand their Illinois workforce.
That technology is one of several ways to build quantum computing and it’s the method that Infleqtion and its investors have bet big on. Last month, the company announced it raised $100 million in Series C funding.
Infleqtion CEO Matthew Kinsella, who displayed one of his company’s “quantum cores” at a news conference Wednesday, said in a follow up interview that the technology is already more effective than traditional methods at sensing time, radio waves and inertia.
“There’s these other products that neutral atoms can build that have real quantum advantage today, like our optical quantum clocks or our quantum RF antennas or the ability, ultimately, to navigate without GPS,” Kinsella said. “That’s truly valuable today.”

The company is set to receive $5.3 million in tax credits from Illinois as part of its expansion in the state. The tax break is through the state’s Manufacturing Illinois Chips for Real Opportunity, or MICRO, program.
PsiQuantum, the first “anchor tenant” at IQMP and a major quantum technology company, received the first MICRO tax credit last year, the value of which the state pegs at about $92.1 million.
Diraq, IBM and the U.S. Department of Defense have all also announced plans in the past year to set up or expand existing facilities in Chicagoland.
Quantum shore 
It’s all part of Gov. JB Pritzker’s plan to make Illinois “a global capital for quantum computing.”
“We have made an aggressive pitch to this burgeoning industry: Come build the future right here in the state of Illinois,” Pritzker said Wednesday.
That pitch has been backed by significant state funding. Last year, the legislature allocated $500 million for a “quantum campus” development, which eventually became the IQMP. The PsiQuantum deal alone cost the state another $200 million, including its MICRO tax credit.

The quantum park, which is set to break ground this year, has attracted significant attention from the quantum industry.
Kinsella said the U.S. has three main hubs of the quantum industry: Chicago, Boston  and Boulder, Colorado.
“And Chicago is emerging as one of, if not the, lead of those,” Kinsella said, noting that Pritzker’s vocal support, the state’s financial backing and the cost of living in Chicago have contributed to that.

The announcement was made at the first “Global Quantum Forum,” a two-day conference organized by the think tank Chicago Council on Global Affairs as well as the economic development organizations P33 and Intersect Illinois.
The event included representatives of dozens of quantum companies, as well as representatives of labor groups, academic institutions and other economic development organizations.
Intersect Illinois CEO Christy George noted that Chicagoland’s two national labs and universities have contributed to Chicago’s growing reputation in the quantum world. She also noted that the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign produces “more engineers than CalTech, MIT and Stanford combined.”
“Our region clearly has the talent, the infrastructure and the resources to lead the quantum revolution,” Intersect Illinois CEO Christy George said.
Local reactions 
The development of the IQMP has sparked positive and negative reactions from community leaders in the neighborhoods surrounding the planned site.
As attendees arrived at the Global Quantum Forum at a venue in downtown Chicago, a handful of protestors from Chicago’s Southeast Side waited outside.
“It’s a former brownfield that still needs to be cleaned up and the community is worried what’s already in it,” Amalia NietoGomez, executive director of Alliance of the SouthEast told Capitol News Illinois at the demonstration.

While NietoGomez called for a “community benefits agreement” — a binding contract to provide certain benefits to a community around a development — several people involved in the IQMP defended the project’s benefits.
“There have been attempts to do things on that site that have not panned out,” Pritzker said. “This has hypercharged, supercharged an endeavor to bring jobs, to bring economic opportunity to the area.”

Chicago Alderman Peter Chico, who represents the area, said that there has been a “good level” of community involvement in the project so far. He pointed to several community meetings and meetings with individual community groups.
Chico also noted that the interest in quantum technology has already provided benefits to the community. Fermilab recently ended a 10-week-long program that offered lessons in  quantum physics and engineering. Several students, according to Chico, have since started internships in the “quantum ecosystem.”
“The educational component is most important to me,” Chico said. “That’s where we got community buy-in. When you talk to parents, that’s where you see their eyes open up and their ears perk up.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Once upon a time, Women & Infants Hospital paid for its workers to take customer service training courses at Disney World. 
Justine Iadeluca — a C-section recovery room nurse who’s worked at the hospital for 23 years — recalled attending one of those employer-paid trips to Florida. But those days are over, Idaeluca said as she stood outside her workplace Wednesday morning.
“It is now an antagonistic relationship,” Iadeluca said of the increasing acrimony between the hospital’s unionized workers, represented by SEIU 1199 NE, and the hospital’s owner, Care New England.   
Iadeluca and other Women & Infants workers held a one-day informational picket outside the hospital Wednesday to decry what the union calls management’s “illegal tactics against workers at the expense of patient care.” The union said eight worker layoffs were announced in the days leading up to the informational picket’s 10 a.m. start, all people who work in medical records and coding in the hospital’s oncology department. This week’s layoffs follow a batch of nine at the hospital announced on May 15 — the same day a strike began at Care New England’s psychiatric holding, Butler Hospital. 
“Every time that we have any kind of action, we let them know they’re having a picket, they lay people off,” Iadeluca said. “Any time the union takes steps up, there’s retaliation by the hospital. We are here to let the community know that there are inherent problems here within Care New England.”
The Women & Infants workers were joined on the picket line by their Butler colleagues, who have been striking for 69 days — the longest hospital strike in the Ocean State’s history, according to the union. The labor stoppage has proven impervious to resolution so far, with multiple meetings between the union and management producing little movement toward an agreement, even with the presence of multiple federal negotiators in the proceedings since May.  
The approximately 1,800 unionized frontline staff at Women & Infants are not on strike like Butler workers, but they feel similarly mistreated by Care New England, Iadeluca said. Women & Infants staff secured a new contract last December, staving off a potential strike. But Iadeluca described it as a “tentative agreement.”
“It’s like they’re not following the contract,” she said. “We run short-staffed. We’re entitled to breaks. They know we’re short-staffed, they know we’re not going to get breaks, and they know that if we don’t get breaks, they’re not gonna pay us for those breaks.”
A summer of fallout
Hillary Lima, a spokesperson for Care New England who works for the external firm Half Street Group, disputed the number of workers laid off this week in a Wednesday evening email. There are more than 2,000 non-medical employees at Women & Infants, she said, and the hospital eliminated seven positions this week.
“These layoffs don’t take effect until October, when the employees will have the option to seek other comparable positions at the Hospital,” Lima wrote. “To date, only a single union employee has taken a layoff under the most recent negotiated contract.” 
Lima added, “SEIU’s charged rhetoric and tactics of disruption are putting unnecessary strain on the state’s health care system. Their paid, professional organizers and lobbyists are putting politics ahead of patients.”
The ties that bind the two hospitals have been emphasized by Care New England in recent weeks, as the hospital system has fortified its public-facing response to the ongoing Butler scuffle. Besides radio ads and updates on its website, the health system has hired the PR firm ofMike Raia — once the top spokesperson for former Gov. Gina Raimondo. Now the president of Half Street Group, Raia said in a July 16 email that the firm will “provide additional bandwidth for media and external relations” for Butler amid the strike.
Previously, Care New England’s internal communications team was handling all Butler-related inquiries. Raia did not divulge specifics about his firm’s relationship with Butler when pressed for additional details about the contract’s scope, expense or start date. 
More expressive was a Monday press release from Raia in which he wrote that “SEIU’s ongoing strike has never been about Butler, its employees, or its patients: It’s been a political power move by professional political leaders that has regrettably and unconscionably put an unnecessary strain on Rhode Island’s health care system.”
Raia’s news release described Butler’s “last, best and final” proposal from July 11 as a “fair and market-leading offer” with “double-digit” wage increases, pension protections, $0 premium health plans, and more perks. He also cited the Butler proposal as potentially better than the one struck last week between Rhode Island Hospital and its unionized workers.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)
The union announced its rejection of Butler’s July 11 proposal on Monday. A July 17 phone interview with union delegate Virgil Soares suggested the union did not view the proposal in the same favorable terms. 
“It’s kind of an ultimatum instead of a proposal,” said Soares, who has been on the negotiating committee twice before. 
Soares has worked in the Butler’s dietary department for nearly 30 years, overseeing a team of cooks and managing meal plans for patients. For the past two months, he’s continued that culinary work as food manager for the ongoing strike, keeping the picket line hydrated and fed. He too said he’s noticed changes in his decades at Butler.
“It just turned so corporate, and it’s a totally different feeling,” Soares said. “The lowest paid workers feel like the lowest paid people.”
Raia, the union’s “indefinite labor strike” led Butler to “shut down roughly 70 beds,” although he did not divulge more details about how patients were affected.
The hospital system has also taken legal action against the state’s labor department, which ruled in June that striking Butler workers had been “locked out” and were therefore eligible for unemployment benefits retroactively from June 1 onward. Butler asked both the Rhode Island Supreme and Superior Courts to block the department’s decision, but a justice denied its motion for a stay on July 10. The Supreme Court will hold a conference on Sept. 4 to determine if it will hear Butler’s case or let the department’s decision stand.

Free.,US House grapples with college athletes’ rights as two panels approve bill on player pay,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-grapples-college-athletes-rights-two-panels-approve-bill-player-pay,,"WASHINGTON — A measure that would set a national framework for college athletes’ compensation got one step closer to becoming law Wednesday after advancing in two separate U.S. House panels.The bill’s fate remains uncertain as it makes its way through Congress, and Democrats argue that the legislation would give “unchecked authority” to the NCAA on athletes’ pay and fails to provide labor and employment protections for athletes.Two panels with jurisdiction over the matter — the House Energy and Commerce and Education and Workforce committees — approved the legislation, known as the the Student Compensation and Opportunity through Rights and Endorsements Act, or ‘‘SCORE Act.”The Energy and Commerce Committee’s vote fell along party lines, 30-23. On the Education and Workforce panel, the 18-17 vote featured all Republicans who were present voting in favor of the measure except Rep. Michael Baumgartner of Washington state. All Democrats on that panel voted against the measure. GOP Reps. Kevin Kiley of California and Elise Stefanik of New York did not vote.Rep. Tim Walberg, chair of the House Committee on Education and Workforce, said the bill “brings much needed stability to college athletics.”“Since the NCAA lifted Name, Image and Likeness and transfer rules in 2021, college athletics have been in a period of chaos as constant litigation and efforts to classify student-athletes as employees jeopardize thousands of academic and athletic opportunities,” the Michigan Republican said during his committee’s consideration of the bill.Kentucky GOP Rep. Brett Guthrie, chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said during his panel’s markup that “without this bill, student-athletes will be left to fend for themselves against bad actors, non-revenue generating sports could face devastating cuts and legal uncertainty will continue to hang over all of college sports.”The full House will not consider the legislation until at least September, when members return from their summer recess that began one day ahead of schedule Wednesday.A federal standardThe effort, nominally bipartisan, comes as the college sports world grapples with the fallout from the NCAA’s 2021 guidelines that let student-athletes profit from their name, image and likeness, or NIL. A patchwork of laws exists across states, and there is currently no federal NIL law.A federal judge in June approved the terms of a nearly $2.8 billion antitrust settlement that paved the way for schools to directly pay athletes.The bill would prohibit college athletes from being recognized as employees and would require colleges to “provide comprehensive academic support and career counseling services to student athletes that include life skills development programs,” such as those regarding mental health, nutrition, strength and conditioning and financial literacy.  The bill’s lead sponsors are GOP Rep. Gus Bilirakis of Florida and Democratic Reps. Janelle Bynum of Oregon and Shomari Figures of Alabama.Guthrie, Walberg and GOP Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Lisa McClain of Michigan, Scott Fitzgerald of Wisconsin and Russell Fry of South Carolina were also original co-sponsors.‘Extreme employment ban’Rep. Bobby Scott, ranking member of the House Committee on Education and Workforce, said that “instead of holding the revenue-rich NCAA and its powerful conferences accountable, the SCORE Act provides a series of blank checks and bailouts that will not uplift or protect college athletes,” during the panel’s markup.The Virginia Democrat said the bill “imposes obligations without oversight, fails to include concrete protections and outright bans college athletes from ever having labor or employment protections.”“This extreme employment ban will not only open the door for further exploitation of college athletes and protect athletic departments’ bottom lines more than the students they serve, it is a broad stripping of athletes’ rights, and that should not be the solution,” he said.Rep. Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat and ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, voiced similar concerns during his committee’s markup.The measure “fails to offer meaningful protections to college athletes and completely ignores the true crisis facing colleges and universities,” he said, adding that President Donald Trump “continues to destroy America’s higher education system with reduced federal research dollars, taxes on endowments and cuts to Federal Student Aid.”Pallone also said the bill “gives the NCAA and conferences nearly limitless and unchecked authority to govern how athletes get paid, if they can transfer schools, and how much time they can be required to spend training, traveling and competing.”",,,,2025-07-23 18:56:35.479729

Gov. Josh Shapiro joined a bipartisan group of leaders in nine states who called for more input on electricity grid operator PJM Interconnection’s governance. The move came as PJM announced a hike in energy costs for the second year in a row.
Clean energy experts said the surging prices for electricity to meet the 13-state PJM region’s peak demands is a clear signal for generators to build new capacity, especially renewable sources such as wind and solar farms.
PJM, however, has been slow to grant approvals. Facing an onslaught of new energy projects seeking permission to connect to the grid, it closed its queue to new applications in 2022.
“When prices go up, it’s meant to send a signal to energy developers: ‘We need more supply.’ But at the same time PJM is holding up a big red STOP sign to energy developers,” Jon Gordon, policy director at Advanced Energy United, said in a statement.
And as demand for electricity increases with the increased electrification of transportation and industry, combined with the proliferation of power-hungry data centers driven by advances in artificial intelligence, consumers feel the pinch.
“With the queue closed, new energy projects in the region can’t get in line to connect to the transmission grid, meaning households and businesses are paying for a price signal that the market can’t even respond to,” Gordon said. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The elimination of tax credits for renewable energy sources in the budget reconciliation act President Donald Trump signed earlier this month and his executive order to end federal agencies’ preference for wind and solar power would make it more difficult to respond to the supply crunch, said Sharon Pillar, executive director of the Pennsylvania Solar Center, which works to extend the benefits of solar power across the state. 
That leaves the grid more dependent on large power stations.
“Solar power, batteries, and energy efficiency measures have been proven to help reduce this peak energy usage, keeping prices down for all consumers by reducing the amount of expensive (and dirty) power needed from these generators,” Pillar said, noting the technology was vital to preventing blackouts on New England’s grid during a recent heatwave.
As demand has increased, PJM said, existing power plants have been retired as a result of federal and state policies to decrease the use of fossil fuels. It has approved 46,000 megawatts of new generating capacity. But, the project’s owners have been slow to move forward due to factors including the availability of equipment, financing challenges and state and local permitting, PJM said in a statement.
Shapiro and Republican and Democratic governors from nine states sent a letter to the PJM Board of Governors last week saying the inability of the organization to efficiently connect new generating capacity and conduct long-term planning has cost the region thousands of jobs and billions in new investment that have gone elsewhere.
“It is long past the time for real grid reforms that allow our region to compete at the speed of business and build a system that delivers affordable, reliable power for the people and businesses PJM serves,” Shapiro said in a statement last Thursday. “I am hopeful that this historic collaboration between the PJM states will provide the opportunity to foster a stronger, collaborative partnership between PJM and the 67 million people it serves to chart a strong energy future together.”
The letter said PJM’s deficiencies threaten the reliability and affordability of the electricity supply consumers need.
“We are deeply concerned that PJM’s response has been typified by halting, inconsistent steps and rising internal conflicts within the stakeholder community,” it reads, noting the “abrupt termination” of two board members and the imminent departure of PJM CEO Manu Asthana.  
Asthana, who has led the organization for five years, announced in April that he would resign to return with his family to their home in Texas. Two board members were not reelected at the body’s meeting in May.

The governors’ letter called on the PJM managers to take action to restore confidence in the organization by appointing “distinguished, widely respected individuals” to the open board seats. The letter requested a meeting with the board’s nominating committee to discuss a proposed slate of candidates.
The letter said representatives of the governors, who include Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, would attend the board’s meeting Wednesday and be available to discuss the proposal.
PJM Board Chair David Mills said in a response to the letter that he would reserve time during the meeting for the representatives to share the governors’ perspectives with the entire board. 
A spokesperson for Shapiro declined to comment on the meeting Wednesday.
One Pennsylvania state lawmaker has also called for reforms to improve PJM’s transparency and accountability. While the board of managers is independent of the generators and electric companies that are members of PJM, the member companies vote privately in committees on which policies the board will consider. 
Rep. Chris Rabb (D-Philadelphia) has proposed legislation that would require members to report their votes to the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission. The bill is awaiting action in the House Energy Committee.
“Upper-level votes are sometimes public, but with lower-level votes being held in secret, the damage is often done before a policy is elevated to the upper-level,” Rabb said in a memo seeking co-sponsors. “Simply put, these companies shouldn’t be allowed to vote in secret when our health and the future of our world depends on it.”
PJM, based in King of Prussia, operates the electrical grid that connects power stations to local electric companies from Illinois to New Jersey and from Pennsylvania to North Carolina. It’s responsible for ensuring that there’s enough electricity available when demand peaks on the hottest and coldest days of the year.
As a result of PJM’s annual wholesale capacity auction, announced Tuesday evening, electricity producers will receive $329.17 per megawatt-day to provide capacity when the peak demand hits in 2026 and 2027. That’s the maximum rate approved by federal regulators. A megawatt-day is roughly enough electricity to power up to 900 homes for a day.

That’s a 22% increase over the price set in last summer’s auction, which drove double digit increases in consumer electricity costs that started last month. PJM noted the wholesale price of electricity accounts for a relatively small share of consumers’ electricity bills and this year’s price would likely result in a 1.5% to 5% increase.
The Shapiro administration sued PJM after last year’s capacity auction and reached a settlement in January, later approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, in which  PJM agreed to reduce the maximum bid that generators could offer. 
In a statement Tuesday, the administration cast the results of the auction as a $8.3 billion decrease in costs for electricity customers across the PJM region. In Pennsylvania, 13 million electricity consumers will save an average of $116 in the next year, the governor’s office said.
State  Public Utilities Commission Chairman Stephen DeFrank said the hike in the wholesale cost would have been closer to 36% without the settlement. 
“Between the last two capacity auctions, ratepayers in Pennsylvania and across PJM are paying billions of dollars with minimal new generation on the horizon,” DeFrank said, adding, “The only real, long-term solution to tight market conditions is the addition of new supply from all types of generating resources.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/PJM-Control-Room_2-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-07-23 18:56:35.479729

(Photo by Shahrzad Rasekh/CT Mirror)Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont signed a bill last month intending to prevent hoards of out-of-state traffickers from making an extra nickel in Connecticut by collecting a 10-cent refund on cans and bottles that required only a 5-cent deposit in their state.
But there is no hard evidence that such widespread fraud is happening.
In the last quarter of 2024, the bottle return rate in Connecticut reached 77%, the highest it’s ever been.
But instead of viewing the increased redemption as a consumer response to the 10-cent deposit introduced last year, lawmakers who supported the legislation blamed out-of-state returns, which are illegal.
Sen. Rick Lopes, D-New Britain, told The Connecticut Mirror that the new legislation is “trying to target the people who have a box truck that are coming in from out of state.”
However, there is no record of how many out-of-state bottles are redeemed in Connecticut. Most distributors do not differentiate their bottles by state, meaning there is no way to tell which bottles were sold in Connecticut and which ones were not.
Bob Hanna, owner of Three Veterans redemption center in New Milford, believes that the problem of fraudulent returns is only solvable with technology. Brands that are both a manufacturer and distributor, such as Poland Spring, have taken to placing a red box around the barcodes of bottles they sell in non-redeemable states. If a customer attempts to feed one of these bottles into a redemption machine, it gets spat out.

“There could be a solution to identify these products through barcodes,” says Hanna. “But distributors don’t have power with the manufacturers.”
Since he opened last year, Hanna estimates he’s turned away about 40 out-of-state returners, compared to his 850 regulars.
“The word’s gotten out — you’re not going to get by us,” he said.
Hanna requires his customers to provide proof of Connecticut residency and gives car stickers to his regulars. But still, residency is only a proxy for knowing whether the bottles themselves were purchased in Connecticut.
The legislation limits individuals to redeeming 5,000 bottles a day and requires redemption centers to record the name, driver’s license and license plate of anyone returning over 2,500 bottles. It also allocates $2 million from the General Fund towards bottle redemption law enforcement.
Hanna has customers who return bottles that they did not purchase themselves. A Boy Scouts troop, for example, brought in 13,000 after a clean-up project. Some patrons regularly return cans they fish out of the trash after local baseball games.
“Just because you don’t need the dime, or I don’t need the dime, I save all mine, and I don’t necessarily need it, but why am I going to give it to the state? Why am I going to give it to the distributors?”
When Connecticut bottles are not redeemed, the 10-cent deposit is shared among distributors and the state. In fiscal year 2023-2024, the state made over $42 million in revenue from unclaimed bottle deposits.
“I just believe [the new legislation] is a money grab for not only the state but for distributors,” Hanna said.
There is no public data on where bottles are being redeemed; DEEP considers this information proprietary.
Disclosure of returns is up to the beverage distributors. In testimony in support of SB 1115, Coca-Cola Beverage Northeast said that its Q4 2024 redemption rate in border areas was 83%, compared to 61% in the middle of Connecticut, and that this was evidence of fraud, despite the lack of data regarding bottle origins.
Wayne Pesce, President of CT Food Association, draws his conclusion from images and videos he’s seen from grocery stores, such as a man unloading an SUV full of bottle bags, and cars in a parking lot with out-of-state license plates.
“We are trying to limit fraudulent volume because our customers can’t get into our stores when someone comes back with 500 containers and Mrs. Johnson can’t get in with her 50,” he said.
On a recent weekday afternoon, the redemption room at the Big Y supermarket in Norwalk was empty. Store managers said they have not had problems with large volumes of bottle returns, and they have not heard of problems at any other Big Ys.
Even though redemption rooms in grocery stores are small, they take up valuable space. Groceries would rather sell mulch, winter salt, or literally anything else more profitable than the 2.5¢ per malt beverage, 3.5¢ for soft drink handling fee they receive for every bottle they process.
“There’s no profit incentive for a retailer in the state of Connecticut to redeem bottles and cans. Zero,” says Pesce.
“We’re paying our associates $20 an hour, and our bottle rooms are open for the hours of the store,” says Pesce. “We’ve got to keep them clean, and we’ve got to pay labor to do it.”
Meanwhile, redemption centers like Three Veterans LLC in New Milford have worked to make a profit since the raise to 10¢. Hanna estimates they process 15,000 bottles each day they are open. They allow their customers to drop off bottle bags for their workers to process.
“They get some time back, that’s all we can offer them,” he said.

Redemption center owners are skeptical that the new teeth in the law will catch the amount of fraud others are so certain is there.
“It’s just like the guy who can walk up through a soda machine, kick it three times and hit the return button and get a soda for free,” says Hanna.

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)A federal judge on Wednesday permitted two ballot question committees to join an existing lawsuit from the League of Women Voters of Arkansas that challenges the constitutionality of new direct democracy-related laws.
Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids, ballot question committees attempting to qualify separate proposed constitutional amendments for the 2026 ballot, filed a motion to intervene in the League’s existing lawsuit in May.
The League has asserted the new state laws are burdensome to efforts to collect signatures for its ballot measure aimed at protecting direct democracy in Arkansas. 
Supporters of the laws have said they ensure the integrity of the states’ initiative and referendum process.
Direct democracy is the process by which Arkansans can propose new laws or constitutional amendments and place them on the ballot for a statewide vote. Arkansas is one of 24 states that allow citizen-led initiatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Attorney General Tim Griffin certified the League’s ballot title in May, but has twice rejected a similar proposal by Protect AR Rights. Griffin approved For AR Kids’ education-related measure in February. 
Court filings reveal opposition to intervening motion in Arkansas direct democracy lawsuit

The motion to intervene from Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids seeks to challenge laws not included in the League’s suit — Act 602 of 2025, which prohibits ballot titles from being written above an eighth-grade reading level, and Act 236 of 2023, which mandates petition signatures must be collected from at least 50 counties instead of 15 as directed in the Arkansas Constitution.
Both the League and the lawsuit’s defendant, Secretary of State Cole Jester who’s represented by Griffin, opposed the motion to intervene in court filings.
U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks disagreed Wednesday with their assertion that Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids lack standing. In a six-page ruling, Brooks rebuts the assertion that harm posed by the reading-level law is “merely hypothetical,” noting that since that argument was made in court documents, Griffin cited that law in his rejection of Protect AR Rights’ measure.
Brooks also addressed the argument of lack of standing for Act 273 of 2025, a law challenged by the League that would disqualify signatures collected by canvassers if the secretary of state finds “by a preponderance of evidence” that they violated state law collecting the signatures. 
The state asserts that injury under the provision is “too remote and speculative” because the committees would have to collect the requisite signatures and have enough rejected signatures to disqualify the measure from the ballot. 
Citing a South Dakota case in which the Eighth Circuit appeals court held that a ballot question committee had standing to challenge a similar law, Brooks said the Arkansas law “uses the threat of invalidating voter signatures to force compliance with laws that reduce that number of people willing and able to circulate petitions.”
“This works a concrete and particularized injury on [ballot question committees], which must endeavor to comply with these laws even if their petitions are not ultimately thrown out,” he wrote. 


Let us know what you think...


 

Regarding the motion to intervene, the League and the state both argued that Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids “are adequately protected by the existing Plaintiffs,” Brooks wrote. The League also asserted that the groups’ interest in the case is contingent on future events that may not occur. 
“For the same reasons the Court rejects Plaintiffs’ standing argument, it concludes that Movants do have an interest in this litigation based on the burden the challenged laws allegedly place on Movants’ protected speech,” Brooks wrote. 
While the court agrees that wanting to add more claims and defendants to existing litigation doesn’t demonstrate inadequate representation, “Plaintiffs make a troubling assertion in their Response that leads the Court to conclude that Movants’ interests may not be adequately represented,” Brooks wrote. 
The League argued in its complaint that this isn’t a partisan issue. But in its response, the League asserted it would be prejudiced if Protect AR Rights intervenes in the case because the group wants the laws blocked to increase the chance of its measure qualifying for the ballot. Protect AR Rights’ measure “directly competes” with the League’s, according to court documents.
Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids argue that the League’s attack on the substance of Protect AR Rights’ measure “raises serious doubts” that the League will “vigorously pursue” the ballot question committee’s common claims if the League determines later that it can qualify its measure for the ballot without challenging some of the laws, according to court documents.
Arkansas group files proposed injunction on direct democracy laws

“The Court agrees and finds that Movants are entitled to intervention,” Brooks wrote.
Little Rock attorney David Couch filed a motion on behalf of the League last week for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction in the case. Now that the judge has granted the motion to intervene, Couch said he expects Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids will file their own motion to block the laws. The judge will likely schedule a hearing on the motions soon, he said.
“We’ll work together as a team because the ultimate goal is to have these laws enjoined, and it’ll be up to the AG to raise whatever legal defenses they have to their issues at this point in time,” Couch said. “As far as I’m concerned, the judge says they’re on my team, they’re on my team.”
The motion to intervene was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas, Elias Law Group LLP and Shults Law Firm LLP on behalf of Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids. John Williams, legal director of the ACLU of Arkansas, said in a press release Wednesday that he was pleased with the court’s decision, which “ensures that the voices of grassroots groups actively engaged in the ballot initiative process will be fully represented in this case.”
“Our clients are already feeling the impact of these unconstitutional laws, and now they’ll have the opportunity to stand up in court and defend the First Amendment rights of all Arkansans who seek political change through direct democracy,” Williams said.
Griffin said in a statement that the judge’s decision doesn’t affect his defense.
“I respect the court’s decision, which doesn’t change our defense of the State. I remain steadfast and confident in our case,” he said.

A new historical marker celebrating the legacy of the Rehoboth Beach Patrol will be unveiled Tuesday, August 5, at a public ceremony on Baltimore Avenue in front of the patrol’s new headquarters.
The 9 a.m. event will recognize more than 100 years of lifesaving service provided by the patrol along the city’s two-mile stretch of coastline.
“We are honored to receive this state historical designation for the Rehoboth Beach Patrol,”said Mayor Stan Mills. “It signifies the dedication, hard work, and compassion that the patrol has brought to our beaches for more than a century. It’s a legacy today’s beach patrol continues to uphold.”
Founded in 1921 by Benjamin F. Shaw and the American Red Cross, the Rehoboth Beach Patrol (RBP) has long served as a cornerstone of public safety at the popular beach destination.
Over the decades, the patrol has provided a wide range of services, including rescues, medical aid, beach evacuations, and helping reunite lost children with their families.
The marker also highlights two key programs developed by the RBP: the Lifeguard Olympics, which began in 1977 and bring together lifeguards from Delaware and neighboring states to compete in water and rescue challenges, and the Junior Lifeguard Program, launched in 1997 to teach children ocean safety, first aid, and basic rescue skills.

The South Burlington School District’s superintendent, Violet Nichols, resigned from her position on Tuesday night following months of pressure from the district’s local teacher’s union, who cited a toxic working relationship between the superintendent’s office and staff. 
The district’s school board received a resignation letter from Nichols on Friday, according to board chair Seamus Abshere. She announced her decision during a special meeting on Tuesday, at which the board voted unanimously to accept the letter. 
Nichols’ resignation, effective Aug. 1, was first reported by The Other Paper. 
“It is with a heavy heart — but with clarity and conviction — that I announce my resignation as superintendent of the South Burlington School District,” said Nichols, who has led the district since 2022, at the public meeting. “It was a privilege to show up every day and to lead this district with professionalism and purpose.”
Her resignation, and the weeks of contentious board meetings that preceded it, underscores what became a deep rift between the district’s administration and the local teachers’ union as the district responded to an increasingly tight budget for the coming school year. 
One of the larger school districts in the state, the portion of state education funding allocated to the Chittenden County district was reduced following Act 127, which made changes to the current funding formula that went into effect last year. The district’s budget restrictions led the school board to cut 15 full-time positions.

The district, meanwhile, remains in open contract negotiations with the teachers’ union, Abshere said.
The South Burlington Educators’ Association said that their grievances do not stem from budget difficulties but rather from Nichols’ leadership and her handling of those challenges. Union officials and staff at board meetings over several months said Nichols created a chaotic and toxic work environment within the district.
The relationship between Nichols and the board spilled into the open in April, when members of the South Burlington Educators’ Association came out en masse to a board meeting to publicly voice their grievances with the district’s leadership.
There, tensions spilled out over two racial discrimination complaints that had been filed against Nichols. An outside investigator was brought in and ultimately determined that no wrongdoing occurred and the district board later initiated an improvement plan.
Union leadership called for a change in leadership for the district in a press release issued last month, citing a survey of more than 300 teachers and staff members that they said showed educators had a “distrust and fear of district leadership,”
Beth Adreon and Noah Everitt, the co-presidents of the union, wrote in the release that it was “overwhelmingly clear to faculty and staff that we need and want new leadership for our students in South Burlington. It is time for change.”
Everitt, in an interview on Wednesday, noted that when the district has been forced to cut programs in previous years, “it’s been very clearly communicated how we’re going to continue to do this work.”
“In this cycle, it was chaotic at best, including a last minute adoption of a budget that had cuts that nobody had seen,” he said.
Abshere also cited a different survey conducted by the central administration months before the union’s, showing poor morale among staff. Nichols did not share the results with the board until April, he said.
Over the last several weeks, Nichols pushed back on criticisms of her tenure. Before her announcement on Tuesday night, she asked the district’s human resources director, Daisymae Brayton, to note that there were no officially recorded grievances filed against her by staff members.
But, after a more than hour-long executive session Tuesday night, Nichols announced she had tendered her resignation, effective Aug. 1.
“I am incredibly proud of the transformative work we’ve accomplished together,” she said.
Board turnover
Nichols’ resignation marks a continuation of what has been a dysfunctional year for the South Burlington School District.
The board’s former chair, Chelsea Tillinghast, resigned from the board in May, just the latest departure in a spate of turnover on the board since Nichols’ tenure began. 
On Monday, Tim Warren, a school board member, announced his resignation in a press release, citing “several months of growing concern about the board’s direction, particularly in its treatment of our superintendent.”
“Over the past several months, the board has devoted a disproportionate amount of time and energy to efforts aimed at removing the superintendent, rather than building a constructive, working relationship,” he wrote. “The majority seems unconcerned with the consequences of this effort or what comes next.”
He added, “This focus has come at a significant cost, not only in legal fees but also in lost time, trust, and progress. As we face pressing matters such as contract negotiations, budget planning, and a looming, seismic change in the education landscape, I consider the board’s continued preoccupation to be a harmful distraction.”
The board now has to fill two vacancies on the seven-member school board, and begin the process to find an interim superintendent with less than two months before the start of the new school year.
During a meeting earlier this month, board members voted to make an amendment to board policy governing that the superintendent “shall not retaliate against or discipline a District employee” for speaking to the board or to central administrative staff.
It appeared to be a direct response to the allegations aired in April. But Nichols alleged the on-the-fly amendment violated open meeting laws, as well as the term of her contract.
Some at Tuesday’s special meeting expressed dismay with the board’s treatment of Nichols in previous meetings. Three former board chairs of the South Burlington School District — including House Rep. Bridget Burkhart, D-Chittenden — decried what they characterized as unprofessional treatment of the superintendent.
Kate Bailey, former chair of the board, said that holding the special meeting with little notice was “not transparent,” that the board was “coercing our superintendent to follow what you say, instead of the district’s own policies and procedures,” and that it was “pressuring her to resign.”
Tillinghast, the former board chair who resigned in May said that the board was “purposefully colluding with members of staff to fire the superintendent.”
Burkhardt, a former chair of South Burlington’s school board, cast doubt on whether the board was equipped to face challenges ahead “with regards to… changes that are coming from the state level.”
“For this district to move forward and face the challenges it’s going to face, there needs to be collaboration between the board and the superintendent, we need to be moving in the same direction,” she said.
Abshere said during Tuesday’s meeting that the board will begin the process to find Nichols’ replacement in the coming weeks.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Despite expanding the availability of medication-assisted treatment, state health officials only treated about 4% of the New Mexicans estimated to have opioid use disorders in public health offices, a report released Wednesday found.
The finding was one of several Legislative Finance Committee analysts presented to lawmakers from a 38-page report evaluating the New Mexico Department of Health programs to address opioid and alcohol addiction treatments after a 2024 expansion of services offices in most counties in New Mexico.
While 9,100 New Mexicans have opioid use disorder requiring treatment, the New Mexico Department of Health only treated 321 people in public health offices during fiscal year 2024, with most offices treating fewer than 10 people. Only three people with alcohol use disorder were treated with medicated-assisted treatment over the same time frame.
Analysts issued recommendations for state health officials to: centralize marketing and management of the program; set performance targets for treating more people in public health offices; report the data; pursue mobile clinics and better promote the treatment.
NMDOH Secretary Gina DeBlassie told lawmakers she agreed with the assessment, saying the department was working to hire someone to lead the program, and that the department would expedite marketing efforts.
“We haven’t done enough in the community as it relates to getting the word out about our [Medication for Opioid Use Disorder] services ” DeBlassie told lawmakers. “We recognize that. We’re working on that.”
Medication-assisted treatment, nicknamed MAT, includes medications that are proven to reduce cravings and prevent withdrawal symptoms from both opioids and alcohol. Experts say MAT is crucial to treating alcohol and opioid use in New Mexico,which has some of the highest rates in the nation.
The state also delivers MAT through prison programs; the New Mexico Rehabilitation Center and Turquoise Lodge Hospital; and certain certified clinics. However, the expansion into public health offices was to offer services to underserved populations and decrease travel, according to past statements on the program.
The majority of MAT is delivered by private providers, with Medicaid data showing that more than 10,000 New Mexicans sought treatment in 2024. Most people who sought MAT traveled to get it, according to Maggie Klug, a program evaluator for the Legislative Finance Committee.
“This highlights the need the public health offices are trying to meet, while also indicating that people may not be aware of the treatment available in the local public health offices,” Klug said.
Rep. Harlan Vincent (R-Ruidoso Downs) compared NMDOH’s performance to “a fire department only running 4% of the calls.”
DeBlassie responded that she agreed with the statement, adding that the department’s program stalled in March 2025, and that NMDOH is committed to marketing the program and seeking additional referrals.
“There are individuals within the community that are in need of treatment, and I can guarantee they did not know that the public health office is a resource and we’re looking to change that,” DeBlassie said.

(Photo by USDA)The U.S. House Committee on Agriculture met Wednesday for a hearing and a renewed push to neutralize a California law that stipulates the living conditions of certain livestock
The law, referred to as Proposition 12, has been the subject of several lawsuits and proposed legislation as opponents say the law creates a “patchwork” of “uncertainty” in the industry. 
In late June, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a case against Proposition 12. Witnesses at the House hearing said the dismissal does not equate to a ruling from the court, but instead shows the need for congressional action on the issue. 
Proposition 12 was a state referendum approved in 2018 that took effect in 2024. The law stipulates meat sold in the state must comply with state animal confinement regulations, even if the animals were raised outside of California.

This means if an Iowa producer, for example, wanted to sell uncooked pork cuts into the California market, their pork must have been raised in a setting where sows had at least 24 square feet of room. Eggs would have to come from chickens that were raised with at least 1 square foot of space to comply with the California law. 
Protein sold to states other than California do not need to comply, but industry leaders say the California pork market is too large to ignore. 
Animal rights organizations in support of the law say the spacing stipulations would give the animals enough space to turn around freely and provide greater welfare to the animals. 
Lawmakers have attempted to block the law several times. The Ending Agricultural Trade Suppression (EATS) Act in 2023 attempted to stop states from enforcing preharvest conditions on agricultural products for sale in interstate commerce settings. Opponents of the bill argued it would not only suppress Prop 12, but also interfere with many state-based agricultural laws. 
Ag committee Chairman Glenn “G.T.” Thomson, said lawmakers should look instead to the language from the House’s Farm Bill proposal from last year, which did not pass. Thomson said this language was more specific and would allow rules like Prop12 to exist, but to only be enforceable on proteins raised in that state. 
“In order to protect the right of American farmers and ranchers to raise their animals how they see fit, we must provide a fix for Proposition 12,” Thomson said in his opening comments.
At the Wednesday hearing, pork producers said the bigger confinements required by the law don’t always work in favor of the sows and the cost to comply with California’s law is high for producers and consumers. 
Pat Hord, an Ohio pork producer and vice president of the National Pork Producers Council, has outfitted parts of his operation to be compliant with Prop 12. He said the law and the potential for the 49 other states to enact their own standards “threatens” his farm with an “unmitigated regulatory patchwork.” 
Hord supported congressional action that would stop Proposition 12 and prevent future states from following suit.
An economist with NPPC who also testified Wednesday said it costs farmers $3,500 to $4,500 per sow to build compliant pens. Hord said the law is not only costly to comply with, but is “inherently less efficient.”
“All farms have or will continue to experience productivity losses under Prop 12,” Hord said to the committee. “You simply cannot house the same number of sows in the same size barn.”
Hord said the burden to comply would be even greater on small and medium sized farmers who have less capital to spend on costly upgrades. This in turn, he said, would lead to more consolidation in the pork market. 
Animal welfare
The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, or ASPCA, said in a press release that laws like Proposition 12 “challenge” the “cruel status quo” of industrial agriculture. 
“Contrary to the narrative being pushed by industrial agriculture interests at today’s hearing – which notably excluded the voices of independent farmers – there are thousands of farmers across the country who support and depend on commonsense bans against the cruel confinement of farm animals,” ASPCA President and CEO Matt Bershadker said in the release. “We encourage Congress to listen to these farmers and protect state laws like Proposition 12 which create vital market opportunities for higher-welfare farming that align with the values of the American public.
ASPCA said the Senate’s recently introduced “Food Security and Farm Protection Act” was a repackaging of the EATS act and must be kept out of the upcoming Farm Bill. 
The animal rights group said bills like EATS are an “unprecedented federal assault” on states’ rights to pass laws on agricultural practices and sales. 
Matt Schuiteman, an Iowa pork producer and board member with Iowa Farm Bureau, said the best animal welfare comes when farmers are able to adjust their operations to their individual conditions and to their animals. This is something he said Proposition 12 would make more difficult to do.
“The most important thing I’ve learned from a lifetime of raising pigs is that it’s critical for producers to have full control over the environment in which their pigs are raised,” Schuiteman said. 
He also said when breeding pigs are not confined, the social hierarchy within a herd kicks in and pigs down the pecking order are pushed away from food or water. This is not only bad for the sow, but also means she’ll have smaller litters, which hurts the farmer’s outputs. 
U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, said the poor outcomes for pigs under the law show California is “clueless” about hog farming. 
“This all happens because California has a liberal, progressive agenda that has no idea what farming is all about,” Feenstra said. “Let’s be clear, Prop 12 is a direct threat to our viability of family farms, the health and welfare of animals and the affordability of pork production in America.”
U.S. Rep. Jim McGovern, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said the whole hearing was a “misrepresentation of reality” and the panel of witnesses was “not a balanced panel.”
McGovern said there are “thousands” of farmers who support Proposition 12 and many small-operation producers who have benefited from the new market opportunities for “humanely raised meat” under the law. 
“If you kill Prop 12, you are putting independent family farms at risk,” McGovern said. “It will be get big or get out all over again.” 
Recent data from U.S. Department of Agriculture shows about 27% of U.S. hog farms already compliant with Prop 12, or are in the process of becoming compliant with the law. 
The data, according to an analysis from Politico, said pork prices in California are nearly 20% higher than they were this time last year.
Lilly Rocha, executive director of the Latino Restaurant Association, said these higher prices impact small family businesses in the state, make it more difficult for consumers to buy pork or pork products, which distances Latino customers from their cultural heritage. 
GOP governors support rollback of Prop 12 
Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, along with seven GOP governors, submitted a letter to members of Congress Wednesday, urging them to support the Save Our Bacon act, introduced earlier in the day by U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson of Iowa. 
Hinson, in a social media post on X, said the bill would “push back on California’s radical Prop 12.”
The letter from state governors called the California regulations “arbitrary” and “out of touch,” especially as it drives up production prices across the country and consumer pork prices in the state. 
“When one state decides to regulate another, federal legislation is appropriate and necessary,” the letter said. “We ask that Congress make clear that each state may regulate livestock production within its own borders, but not the production of livestock in other states.”
In addition to Reynolds, the letter was signed by governors from Mississippi, Indiana, Nebraska, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma and Virginia. 
The Trump administration has also sued the State of California and its officials for the impact the law has had on egg prices in the state. This lawsuit came shortly after the Supreme Court’s dismissal.
In closing, Thompson said the courts have shown “this is a responsibility Congress has to fix.” 
“This committee will consider a measured correction that preserves states’ rights to control their internal agriculture practices,” Thompson said. “We’ll protect interstate commerce and preserve states’ animal health regulations and laws.”

Snowpack isn’t what it used to be. Severe drought has set in for portions of western Wyoming river basins, even after decent snow years, due to factors exacerbated by climate change. 
The post Wind, Snake, Bear rivers hit record low flows as Wyoming’s summer drought gains steam appeared first on WyoFile .","During last winter’s peak, the snowpack blanketing southern Yellowstone National Park — mountains and snowfields that feed the high reaches of the Snake River — was sitting pretty good. 
“We were right near average,” said Jeremy Dalling, a civil engineer who leads water operations in the Upper Snake system for the Bureau of Reclamation. 
Once April hit, however, so did a prolonged period of dryness now extending into July, with just 60% of normal precipitation. A lack of precipitation, low base flows in rivers and exceptionally poor soil moisture also made for rough conditions going into the winter of 2024-’25.
Squeezed by aridity on both ends, the Snake basin’s roughly 100% of average snowpack both melted off early and went into the ground instead of rivers and creeks. 
“It’s a compounding effect, actually over several years, that can lead up to this,” Dalling said, referring to record-low levels in the Snake River above Jackson Lake, even in the wake of a decent snow year. 

The Snake River headwaters enjoyed a near-normal snowpack in winter 2024-’25, but early runoff, exceptionally dry soils and a lack of precipitation have led to the lowest flows on record. (USGS)
As of Wednesday, the U.S. Geological Survey’s river gauge above Jackson Lake was detecting less water than it ever had before during the last week of July. Just 147 cubic feet per second — a relative trickle — were passing by the Flagg Ranch gauge. In 41 years of recordkeeping, that’s the lowest by a large margin. The previous minimum flow for July 23 was 263 CFS. This time of year, the typical flow coursing through the Flagg Ranch Canyon is 516 CFS, meaning the dismal dribble presently detected is only 28% of average. 
“We’re experiencing August [river] levels in July, more or less,” Dalling said. “It’s a system-wide drought condition.”
The decent snowpack resulting in dismal or worse summer river flows is a dynamic that also carried over to the southern Rocky Mountains this year, said Jeff Lukas, a climate and water researcher who spent 20 years as a scientist with the University of Colorado-Boulder. 
“Things just happened to look really good on April 1 this year and increasingly shitty after that,” Lukas said. 
Reds, browns and yellows denoting record-low to below-average river flows also dominate Colorado’s USGS streamflow map. 
Not all western Wyoming river reaches are running quite so thin in 2025. Counting all Teton Range tributaries, even Jackson Lake’s overall inflow isn’t the lowest on record, Dalling said. And lower down in the Snake, above where it hits Palisades Reservoir, the river flow on Wednesday was 3,870 CFS — a volume that sits in just the 5th percentile of flows for late July. 
New record lows
But there are other western Wyoming river reaches running at new record lows, the USGS’ statewide monitoring shows. The Wind River near Kinnear on Wednesday was carrying 295 CFS, less volume than any other July 23 in 40 years of recordkeeping. 
And the Bear River above Woodruff Narrows Reservoir is holding a pittance of water. Just 2 CFS were flowing Wednesday, a meager 7% of the median 31 CFS that have been detected over 63 years of data.

Like in the Upper Snake, those basins have been plagued by poor soil moisture. The thirsty soil is soaking up any precipitation at a rate that negates last winter’s decent snowpack and rainfall that’s come down.
“Soil moisture west of the divide — except for a couple holes — has been really pretty poor here for quite a while,” Wyoming State Climate Office Director Tony Bergatino told WyoFile. 
It’s not all bad. Northeast Wyoming and the Bighorn Basin are faring well, modeling shows. But one of the maps that Bergatino monitors shows that modeled soil moisture in some regions of Wyoming is also bumping up against record low levels for late July. 
“As you get down into the Green River Basin, and much of the state across the south, the [model] is showing basically zero to second percentile [soil moisture],” Bergatino said. 

A different soil moisture map that models conditions with more precision is also registering near-record low readings, and it shows that the most dismal conditions are at the highest elevations. 
Meanwhile, severe drought has set into portions of the Snake, Wind, Green and Bear river basins, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. 
A downstream disconnect 
Lukas, the Colorado climate and water researcher, pointed out that the relationship between snowpack and river flows isn’t as solid as many think. 
“If you have an 80% of normal snowpack … even if you have normal precipitation the rest of the runoff season, you’ll get a 60 to 70% of normal runoff,” he said. “Over the last 20 years, a 100% snowpack more often ends up at 90% [runoff].” 
As the climate has warmed a few degrees over the last several decades, the divide has grown — and it’s expected to keep growing, Lukas said. 
“Each degree of warming is going to give us less runoff for an equivalent amount of snowpack,” Lukas said. 
“Each degree of warming is going to give us less runoff for an equivalent amount of snowpack.”jeff lucas
“Climate change is part of the story,” he added. “There’s just a bunch of feedback mechanisms: The drying soil, the fact that vegetation can now germinate and grow earlier, the snow is melting out earlier, temperatures are warmer.” 
For Dalling, at the Bureau of Reclamation, there are major implications from the dwindling river flows, which are widespread in the basin he manages. 
“It’s impacting reservoir levels all across the Upper Snake reservoir system,” he said. “Jackson Lake is faring better than others, being as full as it is, but we’re monitoring it day to day for the remainder of the season.”

An almost complete draw-down year, like in 2021, isn’t looking necessary. But Jackson Lake, impounded by a 39-foot-high dam, figures to come down by quite a few feet. 
“On the maximum end [of the projections] we’ll be 76% full in October,” Dalling said. “On the lower end, probably 65% full.” 
The Snake’s spectacular cutthroat trout fishing is another factor that stands to suffer from the poor river flows, which have been joined by higher water temperatures. 
In mid-June, Yellowstone National Park instituted some time-of-day fishing restrictions, prohibiting angling after 2 p.m. in the Madison, Firehole and Gibbon river watersheds. The Wyoming Game and Fish Department has not had to implement similar restrictions, but on Tuesday, the state agency sent out a public notice encouraging best practices for fishing in the heat. That guidance includes ceasing catch-and-release fishing anytime stream or river temperatures exceed 70 degrees — a threshold that can make the fight a lethal affair. 
“Stream temperatures have been getting close to critical points on a number of tributaries of the Snake,” said Darren Rhea, Game and Fish’s Jackson Region fisheries supervisor. 
Snake River water temperatures have been climbing into lethal territory, above 70 degrees, for ethical catch-and-release angling. 

That’s true on the Snake River itself, also. 
Above Jackson Lake, where flows are the lowest on record, the thermometer on the Flagg Ranch gauge climbed up beyond 70 degrees on a handful of days so far in July.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Everyone knows service cuts are coming to the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) as its leadership looks to navigate a $10 million budget shortfall, but just how deeply remains under wraps until the agency’s board of directors meets Thursday afternoon.
The agenda for the board’s 1:30 p.m. meeting lists an executive session followed by a “Board Discussion/Potential Vote” on service changes. But no details about the changes were available as of Wednesday afternoon.
That’s left transit advocates like Amy Glidden in the dark ahead of RIPTA’s first legally-mandated public hearing on the proposed cuts scheduled to begin on Monday, July 28.
“Usually we get the cuts before then,” Glidden, the chair of RI Transit Riders, said in an interview Wednesday. “To have a couple of weekdays — that’s not really fair to the public.”
The head of the union representing RIPTA’s bus drivers says employees remain in the dark too.
“We’re not getting all the answers either,” said Amalgamated Transit Union Local 618 President Walter Melillo. “Obviously things are up in the air. I’m sure they’re going to have some cuts on the table, and it’s going to have a big effect on our members and the public.”
By having a closed-door meeting in the middle of Thursday’s meeting, Glidden said the board is effectively discouraging the public from sticking  around through the end of the meeting — depending on how long the executive session lasts.
“It’s harder to get people out to hearings if you don’t know what the cuts are,” she said.
Asked why proposed cuts weren’t listed on Thursday’s agenda, RIPTA spokesperson Cristy Raposo Perry replied in an email to Rhode Island Current that “the board will receive an update on matters tomorrow.”
“Following that, we will share additional information and hold 12 public hearings as scheduled where public comment will be collected,” Raposo Perry wrote.
Twelve hearings on proposed service changes to be held across the state over six days from July 28 to Aug. 6 were announced in June. At the same time, RIPTA said there will be a proposed fare increase and a list of fixed-route services slated for cuts as RIPTA finalizes its fall service plan.
Bus fare has been $2 per trip since 2010. Before that year, fares typically went up a quarter every two to three years, except for the seven years it remained at $1.25 between 1998 and 2005, according to a chart provided by RIPTA

RIPTA’s June announcement did indicate the end of the South County Express Beach Bus service on Sept. 6. The route connects Central Falls, Pawtucket and Providence, Woonsocket, North Providence and Cranston to the Scarborough, Wheeler, and Salty Brine state beaches during summer weekends and holidays.
“I anticipate rural service is going to be hurt as well,” Glidden said. “We’re looking at basically turning into a metro system.”
In January, Gov. Dan McKee’s recommended fiscal 2026 state budget left a $32.6 million hole in RIPTA’s budget. The General Assembly eventually propped up RIPTA with nearly $15 million in annual revenue from an additional 2-cent increase in the state’s gas tax and upping the agency’s share of the state’s Highway Maintenance Account.
RIPTA administrators reduced the shortfall to $10 million after identifying an additional $8 million in savings from a “favorable price lock” in diesel fuel, along with a positive market performance for the agency’s pension plan. The board also opted to forgo renewing insurance intended to cover medical claims by employees — a move CEO Christopher Durand said saved $480,000 in premiums and fees and five jobs.
But even with the additional savings, Durand told reporters after the board’s June 26 meeting  that the budget cuts could impact as many as 90 to 100 employees — reversing all of the gains made following last year’s wage hike.
“We were headed in the right direction,” Melillo said. “I’m concerned. I don’t want to see anyone lose a job.”
McKee and legislative leaders had ordered RIPTA to finish an efficiency study to recommend ways to reduce costs by March 1. But the board of directors was focused on finding a permanent CEO and didn’t commission Canadian engineering consulting firm WSP to conduct the study until March 27.
Although portions of the study were made public in the final weeks of the 2025 legislative session, a final report has yet to be released.
A May 30 draft report identified underperforming routes, including the 88 bus, which travels between Simmons Village in Cranston to the Walmart off Plainfield Pike; Route 69, which connects the University of Rhode Island to the Port of Galilee; and the 59X express route in North Smithfield and Lincoln.
A June 16 draft memo suggested fare increases. It also recommended reallocating resources away from providing bus service in rural communities with low ridership to more populated low-income areas, along with more service for Providence residents who commute to jobs outside of the city.

That means utility bills could climb, again, in 2026.","The latest electricity auction hit a new record high this month, the grid operator said. That means utility bills could climb, again, in 2026. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Electric prices could rise again next year after the cost of capacity hit a record high in our energy grid operator’s latest annual auction.
PJM Interconnection announced the auction results Tuesday, triggering complaints from both lawmakers who demanded more accountability for its relentlessly rising prices and from environmentalists who blamed the spike on the company’s poky pace in adding more renewable energy and storage to the grid. Republicans, meanwhile, criticized Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration for relying too heavily on offshore wind projects that have not materialized.
The cost of capacity is what the grid operator pays providers to ensure a reliable electricity supply during peak periods. The Valley Forge-based PJM, the nation’s largest grid operator, serves 67 million people across New Jersey, 12 other states, and the District of Columbia.
This month’s auction was the first under a new price cap that PJM agreed to after Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, sued in December over soaring energy costs. Still, the auction ended at the price cap of $329.17 megawatts a day, up 22% from the record price of $269.92 megawatts a day set in last year’s auction. For ratepayers, the increase could boost bills — which already rose about 20% last month — another 5% beginning next summer.
Murphy, Senate President Nicholas Scutari, and Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin issued a joint statement Wednesday condemning the auction results.
“The results of this Capacity Auction show that the price cap New Jersey fought for with other states this year prevented a historic spike in energy prices. However, the results of this auction show energy capacity prices continue to rise — and the fact that energy prices have already reached the cap is a clear sign of structural issues at PJM,” the lawmakers said.
Even before the latest auction, Murphy in April asked federal energy regulators to investigate PJM for the “exorbitant” rate increases and blamed “market manipulation.” He also joined eight other governors in signing an open letter last week to PJM’s board of managers asking to be involved in filling board vacancies.
Murphy, Scutari, and Coughlin repeated that message Wednesday, saying: “We demand that PJM be composed of leaders that take seriously state concerns around affordability and resource adequacy and that the states have a formal say in PJM governance.”

A bipartisan coalition of Congress members also acted, sending PJM a letter earlier this month asking the grid operator to explain how it planned to protect utility ratepayers from “unnecessary cost burdens.”
PJM has attributed rising energy costs to increased demand, largely from power-hungry artificial intelligence data centers, coupled with reduced supply as power plants (especially coal) close.
Environmentalists have long accused the grid operator of having a “clear preference” for fossil fuels and being slow to add renewable energy suppliers to the grid. PJM reported Tuesday that 67% of the grid’s power relies on natural gas and coal, with 21% from nuclear energy, and just 8% from renewable energy sources including hydropower, wind, and solar.
PJM has failed to move along projects that would add almost 210 gigawatts of clean energy to the grid, according to Anjuli Ramos-Busot, the New Jersey Sierra Club’s director.
“Once again, families across the region will pay the price for PJM’s mismanagement of our electric grid and obvious bias towards fossil fuels,” Ramos-Busot said. “It is unfair, unjust, and simply impractical for PJM to dig their heels further into dirty energy and delay progress while cheaper and cleaner energy projects are waiting to be plugged in.”

PJM on Tuesday said it “continues to advance reforms that accelerate the interconnection of new resources.” The company attributed project delays to “challenges outside PJM’s scope, such as permitting timelines, supply chain constraints and evolving project economics.”
Some utilities rushed to assure customers Tuesday that the auction results don’t necessarily guarantee another price hike.
PSE&G told rate payers it expects prices will remain “near flat” next year “as long as other supply-related costs, such as the cost of energy, remain roughly the same.” In the same alert, the utility advised customers to reduce energy consumption to ensure tolerable bills and to enroll in a deferred payment program to avoid crippling bills during seasonal peak usage.
Two New Jersey GOP legislative leaders — Sen. Tony Bucco and Assemblyman John DiMaio — issued statements pinning the blame for rising energy costs on Murphy, with DiMaio saying the governor has done too little to create in-state energy sources that would lower costs for New Jerseyans.
“The Murphy administration has turned a blind eye to affordability,” DiMaio said. “It keeps pushing mandates that drive up costs while ignoring the need for reliable baseload power like natural gas and nuclear right here in New Jersey.”

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Very little of South Dakota’s corn is used to produce sweetened beverages, but the crop’s boosters in the state say a nationwide shift toward cane sugar is an unwelcome sign for corn farmers.
Coca-Cola announced its intention to offer cane sugar-sweetened beverages this week. The company said its new beverages are “designed to complement the company’s strong core portfolio,” rather than replace its regular products, which are sweetened by high-fructose corn syrup. 
The announcement during the company’s second-quarter earnings report confirmed a decision President Donald Trump talked about on Truth Social, his own social media platform. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s secretary of Health and Human Services, has blamed the widely used corn-based sweetener for contributing to a U.S. obesity epidemic.
Cane sugar and high-fructose corn syrup are nutritionally interchangeable, according to the American Medical Association and most scientific studies on the topic. But concerns about the syrup’s status as a processed food product from high-profile advocates, including from Kennedy during his former career as an author and activist, have helped push consumer sentiment toward cane sugar.
Mexico, the United Kingdom, Spain and France are among the countries where Coca-Cola is sweetened with cane sugar.

Farmers in the U.S. plant more than 90 million acres of corn a year, but only 3-4% is refined to produce high-fructose corn syrup for use in everything from beverages to breads.
That’s significant enough to rankle corn groups nationally. The Corn Refiners Association responded to Trump’s announcement by saying the move would hurt U.S. farmers and lead to a loss of manufacturing jobs. 
Uncertainty abounds for farm community as new administration takes shape

South Dakota produced the sixth-largest corn harvest in the U.S. in 2024, but its corn crop is less likely than most to be turned into syrup. Most South Dakota corn is used for ethanol and livestock feed. There are no “wet mills” in the state for syrup production, said DaNita Murray, executive director of the trade group South Dakota Corn.
Even so, Murray calls the move from Coca-Cola “a marketing decision” that throws the health value of her organization’s commodity into question, and potentially pushes down demand for it.
“We firmly believe that demand is demand, and we don’t like the accusation that we’re raising poison,” Murray said.
Changes to demand could ultimately impact South Dakota producers, Murray said, particularly if the U.S. were to follow the lead of some other countries and restrict the use of high-fructose corn syrup. Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, R-Florida, introduced legislation last year that would ban the product. 
Murray pointed to industry-funded research from North Dakota State University that concluded such a scenario would lead to a price decline for corn of between 15 and 34 cents per bushel, with associated reductions in corn cash receipts estimated between $2.2 billion and $5.1 billion. 
Under that hypothetical scenario, South Dakota’s local corn prices would suffer, Murray said.
South Dakota immediate impacts: Perception more than prices
That’s an important point for Doug Sombke of the South Dakota Farmers Union. He’s not so sure a dip in demand for corn from a loss of corn syrup production would make much of a difference.
The price of corn is always a concern, Sombke said, but he doesn’t see corn syrup usage as making even a penny’s difference per bushel unless something radical happens.
Tax laws favor cropland over grassland, ranchers and conservation groups tell lawmakers

“Really, in the grand scheme of things, for the family farmer, it’s so small,” Sombke said.
Sombke would like to see more ethanol production and more diversity in farm operations and crops in the field. The price of corn hasn’t kept pace with the cost of doing business, he said, even as high fructose corn syrup has proliferated across the U.S. food system.
Sombke sees the fight over cane sugar as one focused more on the commodity than the producer. In the U.S., cane sugar production is centered in southern states like Florida, Georgia and Louisiana. 
“This is cane versus corn,” Sombke said.
Corn has advantages in that fight, according to Jim Ketelhut, president of the South Dakota Corn Utilization Council. He isn’t worried about an immediate impact to prices, but said it’s unfortunate that corn has “gotten a black eye” in the public consciousness.
The switch from cane sugar to corn syrup decades ago was a matter of price and utility, he said. If “sugar is sugar,” as Ketelhut put it, there’s little but extra cost to be gained by a shift away from corn syrup.
“The reason it’s used so much is that it’s highly available, and it’s economical for the end users,” Ketelhut said. “Those are the good things nobody talks about.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/591A0144-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-23 18:56:35.479729

(Courtesy of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation)According to federal data, compared with white households, Native American households are 19 times more likely to lack indoor plumbing. That figure jumps significantly for Navajo residents, who are 67 times more likely than other Americans to live without access to running water.
Citing this data, U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) on Tuesday announced he and colleagues from Colorado, Democratic U.S. Senators Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, had introduced the Tribal Access to Clean Water Act.
“Nearly half of Native American households lack access to clean and reliable water supplies. That is completely unacceptable,” Heinrich said in a statement. “By addressing a significant backlog of infrastructure projects and removing barriers to federal programs that provide technical and financial assistance to Tribes, this legislation is an important step toward delivering clean drinking water to all families in Indian Country.”
The bill’s components include authorizing the United States Department of Agriculture to make grants and loans for technical and financial assistance, as well as for construction, and lays specific amounts over the next five years, including:

increased funding authorizations for USDA’s Rural Development Community Facilities Grant and Loan Program by $100 million per year for five years;
Increasing funding authorizations for existing programs of the Indian Health Service for water and sanitation facilities construction;
 and authorizing $90 million over five years for the Bureau of Reclamation’s existing Native American Affairs Technical Assistance Program.

Heinrich previously introduced the bill in 2021 with Bennet. Heinrich, Bennet and Hickenlooper also backed billions for tribal water projects in that year’s infrastructure package.
In a statement of support for the legislation, Anne Castle, co-founder of the initiative on Universal Access to Clean Water for Tribal Communities noted that “some of the starkest examples of the public health impacts from not having clean, running water in the home are right in our backyards,” such as “higher incidence of respiratory disease, gastrointestinal infections, diabetes, and cancer.”
“Water is a sacred resource given to us to protect,” Santa Ana Pueblo Gob. Myron Armijo said in a statement. “It is of the utmost importance that Tribes have access to clean water not only for personal consumption and economic development but also for cultural purposes. Many tribes in the Southwest rely on access to clean water to carry on our culture and traditions.”

(Photo via Google Earth)State regulators have issued a warning to a Mitchell County hospital for alleged violations of trauma-center standards.
According to records of the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services’ Bureau of Emergency and Medical Trauma Services, a “virtual on-site verification” of services at the Mitchell County Regional Health Center was conducted in February 2022 after the hospital submitted an application for self-assessment to the state.

As a result of that inspection, five deficiencies were noted:
Corrective-action plans: The trauma medical director and trauma program manager failed to work together with the trauma peer review committee to develop corrective-action plans for deficiencies in care. The state found that “methods to ensure monitoring, reevaluation, and benchmarking” were not being documented.
Injury prevention: Findings from the trauma registry were not being used to identify injury prevention priorities for implementation.
Identifying events for corrective action: The hospital’s trauma program had no documentation of “event identification” and levels of review that would result in the development of corrective action plans.
Quality improvement: All elements of the hospital’s Trauma Performance Improvement and Patient Safety program – intended to enhance the quality of trauma care and ensure patient safety – were not being reviewed and updated at least annually.
Data used for injury prevention: The hospital’s injury prevention efforts were not being prioritized based on local trauma and epidemiologic data.
The hospital was given one year to correct the five deficiencies, all of which were deemed to be fully resolved in January 2023.
In November 2024, the hospital submitted another self-assessment application and in April 2025, a “virtual verification” inspection was conducted by team of individuals with three additional deficiencies noted by the bureau:
Patient-transfer plans: The hospital did not have collaborative treatment and transfer guidelines that were regularly reviewed with input from higher-level trauma centers in the region. The hospital was given one year to correct the problem.
Brain-death criteria: All trauma centers are required to have written protocols defining the clinical criteria and confirmatory tests to diagnose brain death. The bureau alleges the hospital has failed to meet this standard. The hospital was given one year to correct the problem.
Corrective-action plans: While the trauma center was deemed efficient at identifying events that required corrective action, it failed to adequately develop corrective action plans and establish mechanisms for monitoring, reevaluation and benchmarking. While the bureau’s report indicates that a focused site visit is to be conducted within six to 12 months to determine whether this particular issue has been addressed, the report also states that the hospital currently “remains noncompliant” with this standard.
As a result of the findings, the bureau has issued the hospital a citation and warned the hospital that if it continues to fail to meet trauma-center standards after one year, further disciplinary action, including suspension or revocation of the hospital’s trauma care facility designation, may be imposed.
In a written statement, Beth Trees, chief nursing officer at Mitchell County Regional Health Center, said the hospital is “refining our peer review process in collaboration with our providers and will work closely with the state. Mitchell County Regional Health Center is proud of the high-quality emergency care we provide and confident in the services our team delivers.”

(Getty Images)As the federal government and states move to cut about $1 trillion over the next decade from Medicaid, researchers estimate annual impacts by 2034 of hundreds of thousands of jobs lost and billions less in state and local tax revenue.
The research published this month in the peer-reviewed journal JAMA Health Forum looked at the long-term economic effects of the Medicaid provisions in President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending bill, which cuts the joint state-federal health insurance program for people with lower incomes or with disabilities and provides tax cuts that disproportionately benefit wealthier Americans.
By 2034, the researchers estimated annual economic impacts to reach 302 000 jobs lost and $135.3 billion in reduced economic output, leading to $11.1 billion in annual state and local tax revenue reductions.
Coverage losses could generate $7.6 billion in medical debt, triggering a further $3.8 billion reduction in economic activity, the study said.
Medicaid cuts are likely to worsen mental health care in rural America

As the single largest source of health coverage in the nation that covers 72 million people — or a fifth of the U.S. population — Medicaid is a key source of revenue to health care providers, as well as a significant funding stream for health facilities. Hospitals are major employers and drivers of local economies.
In New York, for example, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul’s office estimates that 65,000 jobs could be lost due to cuts in hospitals and community health centers, as well as a loss of $14.4 billion in hospital-related economic activity.

School leaders across the state are preparing for the new school year with uncertain federal funding. (Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)About $6.5 million in federal education dollars have been released for North Dakota after-school programs, but nearly $19 million remains frozen as educators plan for the upcoming school year.
The U.S. Department of Education confirmed Friday it would release funds for 21st Century Community Learning Center grants, which support before- and after-school programs and summer programs.
In north-central North Dakota, three summer programs had to stop operating after the federal government froze those funds, affecting more than 50 families, said Aimee Erdman, 21st Century Community Learning Centers project director for the North Central Education Cooperative in Bottineau. 
Even though the federal funding has been released to the state, programs are now awaiting their grant awards.
“We’ve never had to pause programming because of a funding issue like this,” said Erdman, who has worked for the education cooperative for 12 years. “It’s always been a question of how much funding is available, not will there be funding at all.” 
All of the after-school programs in the north-central region are supported by federal grants, Erdman said, though one program was able to find support from a local community foundation after the funding freeze. 
Some frozen federal funds for schools released to states by Trump administration

Without the federal dollars, parents who rely on after-school programs would have to find other options, Erdman said.
“And the fact is, there just aren’t options,” she said. “Day cares don’t have openings, and in rural areas, like a tiny little town like Granville or Anamoose, they don’t have Boys and Girls Clubs or a YMCA.”
Robin Nelson, CEO of the Boys and Girls Club of the Red River Valley, said releasing the grants was an important step forward, but the pause delayed review of the grant applications.
“We’re still not out of the woods,” she said.
Federal grants for after-school programs for fiscal year 2026 were removed from the proposed federal budget, which Nelson said could mean more uncertainty for the programs.
ND after-school providers, school districts in ‘limbo’ due to frozen federal grants

North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven was among 10 Republican senators who signed a letter urging Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought to release $6.8 billion that had been frozen for K-12 schools.
Funds other than the after-school program dollars remain under review by the Trump administration.
For North Dakota, that amounts to an estimated $18.9 million in frozen federal funds for student enrichment, teacher professional training, English language grants, adult education and other initiatives.
“I feel for the superintendents trying to plan for starting school back up when the funding they use to run things is in limbo,” Erdman said. 
Jeff Fastnacht, superintendent for Bismarck Public Schools, said this is the first time in his nearly 30-year school administrative career that he doesn’t know what federal funding the district will receive about a month before school starts.
He said the school district allocated more than $550,000 of its 2025 budget in expected grant funds for hiring staff and programming. However, his district, along with many others in the state, still face uncertainty with a majority of the funds still frozen.

“I’m statutorily required to hire people within a certain timeline in North Dakota,” Fastnacht said. He added the district typically uses those funds to hire instructional coaches for teachers and a work-based learning coordinator who connects students with work experience.
“I have to honor the contract that we gave them, kinda waiting for these funds,” he said. 
The grant funds are usually awarded during the winter or early spring for the following school year, Fastnacht said. 
He said the Bismarck school district will be able to use some carryover grant funding to get through the school year. But some things have been put on hold, such as registering for professional development conferences.
Bismarck Public Schools uses a significant portion of the federal grant dollars for the AVID program, which stands for Advancement Via Individual Determination and helps potential first-generation college students, Fastnacht said.
“That’s one really impactful program that we have that I think parents and kids would notice if we didn’t have AVID anymore,” he said. 
Fastnacht said once Congress approves funding for education, the states and local school districts expect that money to flow.
“The executive branch’s power is to administer those dollars, not necessarily withhold them exclusively,” he said.

(Photo via Getty Images)A northwest Iowa school district has agreed to prohibit religious organizations from holding events at schools after receiving a complaint about a Christian group holding National Day of Prayer celebrations on school grounds.
The Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF), a nonprofit organization advocating for the separation of church and state and for nonreligious people, sent a letter to the Le Mars Community School District in June about a local religious group holding events on public school grounds on May 1.
May 1 celebrated as the “National Day of Prayer” by some Christians – in Iowa, several religious organizations as well as officials like Gov. Kim Reynolds have hosted and participated in National Day of Prayer celebrations throughout the state.
One of those celebrations in 2025 in Le Mars took place at the Le Mars Community Middle and High Schools. On May 1, the “National Day of Prayer” Facebook page for Le Mars made a post saying that their members “had the joy of partnering with the Le Mars Youth Network” for the celebration at the Le Mars schools.
“Students were welcomed with donuts, breakfast burritos, orange juice, and hot cocoa—and more importantly, with open hearts and listening ears,” the post stated. “We took time to connect with students and asked them how we could be praying for them. It was a meaningful morning of ministry and encouragement. Join us as we continue to lift up the next generation in prayer.”
The social media post featured images showing adults with the religious organization on school grounds. Side by Side Ministries, the organization listed as a contact point on the Facebook page for the local National Day of Prayer group, did not respond to a request for comment.
Sammi Lawrence, an attorney with the FFRF, said a person alerted their organization about this post. The FFRF contacted the school district with a complaint letter after receiving the information, she said, to notify the school asking them to cease allowing religious organizations to hold events and proselytize students on school grounds.
At the event, adults outside the school system had come to the public schools and “were encouraging students to pray and trying to get students to participate in the day of prayer and learn about it” – actions Lawrence said could be “constitutionally problematic.”
“Public schools … shouldn’t be giving outside adults, outside groups, special access to students on schools ground to tell students about their religious message, to try to get them to join their religious groups, or anything like that,” Lawrence said. “Because the First Amendment gives students the right to be free from religious indoctrination in their public schools. And that includes preventing schools from inviting or letting religious groups like this onto campus for the purpose of trying to recruit or proselytize students.”
In the letter to Le Mars Community School District, Lawrence wrote it is “well-settled law that public schools may not show favoritism toward, nor promote or coerce belief in religion” – and that a public school allowing outside religious representatives onto school grounds for the purpose of promoting their religious beliefs violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment in the U.S. Constitution. The Establishment Clause prohibits the government from establishing or giving preferential treatment to any religion.
In response to the complaint from FFRF, Rachel Fritz, an attorney representing the Le Mars district, responded with a letter stating that the school district communicated with members of the local National Day of Prayer group, instructing them “not to facilitate or lead in any prayer or devotional activities involving students on District property.”
The letter also stated the district has taken “appropriate steps to ensure that any prayer activities occurring on school grounds are entirely student-led or student-initiated, in full compliance with applicable legal standards, including the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.”
The school district did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
Lawrence said her organization receives multiple complaints related to the National Day of Prayer each year. Even when organizations like the Le Mars National Day of Prayer group have “good intentions” in trying to hold events at public schools, she said, these events can  create difficult situations for students who are not Christian.
“When students who are atheist or agnostic, or who are just simply a faith other than Christian, come to school and see a Christian group being allowed on campus and proselytizing and encouraging prayer, that doesn’t make them feel good — that just makes everyone who doesn’t believe in that feel like an outsider, feel like they’re not really part of the community,” Lawrence said. “And there’s just, there’s no need for that. Really, everyone is better off when schools just stay out of the religion business.”

The massive timber tract near Carvers Bay, purchased by The Conservation Fund for $34.2 million, joins a pair of properties in the Lowcountry expected to become state forests after a two-decade hiatus.
“Every year, we lose one million acres of working forests to fragmentation and development,” said Jason Johnson, South Carolina state director for The Conservation Fund.
“The Carvers Bay Forest is one of the nation’s most productive working forests. When the land went up for sale, we stepped in to ensure that it will continue to support wildlife habitat, clean water, recreation, and economic opportunities for local communities — now, and for generations to come.”
The large tract, previously owned by Atlanta-based Forest Investment Associates, lies in the rural, inland area west of Murrells Inlet and Pawleys Island.
Dorchester County purchase could bring SC state forest count to 7

Johnson said the purchase by The Conservation Fund guarantees the land won’t be subdivided by development or converted into one of the large retirement communities popular along the coast.
The Conservation Fund will continue to cut timber on the property and will honor private hunting leases in place. But eventually — within the next four years — Johnson said they hope to transfer the land to the state Forestry Commission, creating a new state forest and allowing for public access.
The property joins a 1,644-acre forest tract, called Beech Hill in Dorchester County, that the Open Space Institute purchased for $11.35 million in May. That land is located between the Edisto River Wildlife Management Area and Givhans Ferry State Park, about 12 miles west of the fast-growing town of Summerville.
Also in May, the Nature Conservancy purchased 2,700 acres in Jasper County known as Chelsea Plantation, for $32 million. Originally nearly 6,000 acres, other parts of the tract had already been sold to home builders.

The size of the Carvers Bay forest property alone makes the land deal stand out, creating a new core of conservation activity in the northeastern part of the state, Johnson said.
It’s about 10 miles away from Waccamaw National Wildlife Refuge and streams on the property flow into the Black River, providing water quality protection for the recently expanded Black River State Park.
The forest also is home to nesting sites for swallow-tailed kites, which are endangered in South Carolina. Emily Jo Williams of the American Bird Conservancy said researchers have tracked via transmitter at least four kites that nest on the property. The soaring black and white raptor is popular among bird watchers in that part of the state, Johnson said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/20250515_194547-1024x478.jpg,,,2025-07-23 17:57:08.601970

President Donald Trump’s approval this week of public assistance funding through the Federal Emergency Management Agency will open up grants to state and local governments and some nonprofits dealing with the aftermath of May storms, including a tornado that tore through Pulaski and Laurel counties in May. The grants will also help with recovery from widespread flooding that inundated Kentucky communities in April. 
Those grants through FEMA’s public assistance program can go toward repairing public buildings, bridges, roads, drinking water and wastewater infrastructure along with measures to fortify infrastructure in the future. Nearly $29 million in funding is being allocated for repairs from the April storms and flooding, while $27.1 million is being allocated for repairs from May storms and tornadoes. 
A release Wednesday from the office of Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says the governor spoke with Trump over the phone and told the president “how well the FEMA teams were conducting operations in Kentucky.”
Sen. Rick Girdler, R-Somerset, and Sen. Brandon Storm, R-London, in a joint statement praised Trump for approving aid for “hard-hit” counties by May storms. 
“This news is a blessing and a critical step forward as we continue recovery efforts from the devastating tornado earlier this year,” the two Republican state senators said. “Our communities are strong, and with this support, we will recover and rebuild.”

Gov. JB Pritzker is leaving open the possibility that Illinois lawmakers could redraw congressional maps with more Democrat-leaning districts.
Texas lawmakers are meeting this week to consider President Donald Trump’s request to add more Republican-leaning districts in the state to boost the party’s power in Congress.
Redistricting is a process that usually takes place every 10 years and isn’t scheduled until after the 2030 census.
Illinois Republicans said Pritzker has no room to criticize Texas lawmakers after he signed 2021 maps giving Democrats an advantage.
As a candidate in 2018, Pritzker said he opposed politicians being involved in redistricting.

Gov. JB Pritzker is leaving the door open to changing Illinois’ congressional maps to “counterbalance” an attempt by Texas politicians to add more Republican seats to the U.S. House.
The Texas legislature is meeting in special session this week with 18 items on their agenda, including redrawing the state’s congressional maps after President Donald Trump urged the state to redraw district boundaries ahead of the 2026 midterm election in hopes of adding five more Republicans to Texas’ congressional delegation and insulating his party against any seats they might lose elsewhere in the country.
Pritzker blasted the move at an unrelated event in Chicago on Tuesday.
“I think we ought to play by the rules – everybody – and I think we ought to have an election in 2026,” Pritzker told reporters. “We’ll see who comes out ahead in the Congress. But I think cheating the way the president wants to is improper.”
Redrawing legislative maps typically happens once a decade after the national census, though sometimes states have been ordered by courts if their legislative maps violated voting rights laws. Texas Republicans also redrew the state’s congressional maps in the mid-2000s to add more Republican-leaning districts.
Pritzker didn’t rule out the thought of Illinois Democrats redrawing congressional districts to add more Democrat-leaning districts in response to Texas.

“We’re all going to have to band together to try to address that; at least to try to stop them by letting them know that if we were doing what they were doing, in fact we would counterbalance and indeed take control of the Congress,” Pritzker said.
The process, however, would have to go through Illinois’ legislature.
“That’s not something we’re pursuing,” a spokesperson for Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, said. 
Illinois Republicans blast comments 
Pritzker’s comments accusing Texas Republicans of “cheating” left Illinois Republicans furious. The party pushed through maps in 2021 with only Democratic support in a largely opaque remap process.
Illinois’ map divides the state’s 17-member congressional delegation into 14 Democrat-leaning districts and three Republican-leaning districts. The three districts currently held by Republicans are mostly large, meandering rural areas Democrats didn’t draw into districts they wanted.
“It’s rich that the Governor now claims to support playing by the rules — after he enthusiastically signed into law the most gerrymandered maps in the nation,” House Republican Leader Tony McCombie, R-Savanna, said in a statement. “When it was convenient, he promised to reject partisan maps in favor of fair representation.”
Rep. Ryan Spain, R-Peoria, also condemned gerrymander in other states.
“I disagree with efforts in other states to double down on further partisan gerrymandering, but I can make that statement because I voted against partisan gerrymandering in Illinois and have been dedicated to its elimination for many years,” Spain said in a statement.
Illinois’ current congressional map earned an F grade from the independent Princeton Gerrymandering Project, finding the map fails in every category on political fairness and competition and geographic compactness.

The 16th District represented by Rep. Darin LaHood runs from south of Bloomington to Galena and includes areas outside urban populations in Bloomington-Normal, Peoria and Rockford. The 15th District represented by Rep. Mary Miller includes much of central Illinois but is split in half by a Democrat-leaning district that runs right through the middle of it to include Champaign, Decatur, Springfield and the St. Louis suburbs.
The 12th District represented by Rep. Mike Bost includes a large swath of southern Illinois.
Whether Illinois Democrats could expand the map to create 15 Democrat-leaning districts remains to be seen, as even maps drawn for partisan gain must meet legal requirements, including for compactness, as outlined in state and federal voting rights laws.
The map was signed in 2021 by Pritzker after the House Democrats’ lead mapmaker, Rep. Lisa Hernandez, D-Cicero, admitted during debate over the maps that “partisan advantage” was considered.
Candidate Pritzker’s position 
As a candidate for governor in 2018, Pritzker said he opposed gerrymandered maps and supported an independent mapmaking commission.
“I 100% oppose gerrymandering,” Pritzker said in a 2018 social media post two months before he would go on to win the Democratic nomination for governor. “Legislative districts should adhere to both the Federal and Illinois Voting Rights Acts, and I support redistricting reform that advances fairness and removes politics from the process.”
Republicans have filed legislation to create an independent redistricting commission and take the power away from lawmakers, but it has never been considered by the General Assembly under Democrat control.
Republicans have filed multiple lawsuits to try to force an independent commission to redraw the maps, but they have failed early in the court process.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The president of the country’s postal union is sounding the alarm on privatization of the service.
And in Montana, some residents might soon start seeing TV commercials from the American Postal Workers Union seeking to “alert the public” of privatization attempts of the service. 
The ad campaign, which is in eight states, follows a Wells Fargo Equity Research document to investors which includes plans to close post offices as well as higher prices for those using the service. 
It also includes an end to the “Universal Service Obligation,” which is essential that all postal users receive a minimum level of service at a reasonable price and requires six day-per-week mail delivery.
“There is an intensified effort really coming from the billionaires and Wall Street about privatizing the public United States Postal Service,” APWU president Mark Dimondstein said in an interview with the Daily Montanan. “Which means either breaking it up in whole or piecemealing it out whole or in part to private companies that then decide who gets mail under what conditions, based on whether somebody can make a profit.”
The document from Wells Fargo details five steps that would need to be taken in order for the service to be privatized, starting with new legislation. It would take a Congressional Act and signage by the president for that to happen, the document states.
The document also said that $400 billion in pension and healthcare liabilities need to be addressed. The USPS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“Our sense is these liabilities would likely be moved to another entity (likely to the US taxpayer where they arguably are now) since potential buyers and/or investors would be reluctant to assume such a large legacy liability, but could be addressed through a parcel sale/IPO or real estate monetization,” the document states.
The Postal Service is currently funded by its own revenue. Other steps outlined in the report include employees losing jobs.
“Especially amid recent DOGE efforts on federal cost control, it is likely that employees receive a type of deferred buyout offer to leave or layoffs could ensue,” the report says.
It also said the USPS would need to raise its prices on parcels 30%-140% to “reach pricing parity with parcel competitors.”
In Montana, mail has been an issue that’s caught the attention of some legislators, including U.S. Senator Steve Daines. He’s penned letters to the Postmaster General and has also issued numerous statements expressing concern with service in the state.
Daines office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Dimondstein described the Senator as someone who gets the issue.
“He understands what it means for the constituents of such a rural status as Montana,” Dimondstein said. “He certainly expressed, as we did, some of the concerns around service.”
There’s also been issues with air mail in the state. In 2023, the Missoulian also described various issues with mail in Missoula.
Earlier this year, in another report, the newspaper stated some postal employees were dealing with fatigue, burnout and work weeks up to 80 hours.
President Donald Trump has described the postal service as “a joke” and the appointment of David P. Steiner, a former FedEx executive, to the position of Postmaster General. These moves have the APWU concerned.
The ads will run in Alaska, Oklahoma, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Dakota and nationally on CNN, MSNBC, and FOX.
“This is really part of our foundation, part of how the country was built, and it’s going to help propel us forward,” Dimondstein said. “And in that sense, it’s a source of pride for the entire country, certainly a source of pride for those who do the work and serve the people.”

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida’s flagship university is raising rates on its out-of-state students by 10 percent, the first such increase at the University of Florida in more than a decade although university officials said that students who can prove it will cause a significant financial hardship can get the increase waived.
The UF’s Board of Trustees signed off on the hike during a Wednesday virtual meeting and the decision comes shortly after the state Board of Governors gave the green-light for schools to raise tuition for those students who are not residents. 
The changes at UF are expected to raise the per-credit hour cost for undergraduates by more than $74 or more than a $1,000 a semester for those taking a full load of 15 credit hours.
The decision as to whether to waive the increases will be made by Mary Parker, the university’s vice president and chief enrollment strategist.
UF leaders defended the tuition hike by noting that the cost of instruction has risen in recent years and that Florida’s overall out-of-state tuition cost remains among the lowest among top 10 public universities.
According to College Transitions about 85% of the undergraduate students who attend the university are Florida residents while the remaining students are from out of state or other countries.
During the brief meeting Mori Hosseini, the chair of the UF board, said that the school won’t reopen its search for a new president until some time in the next year. 
There is a question about who will lead the institution since interim president Kent Fuchs is scheduled to step down as interim president on July 31. Florida is without a permanent leader after the Board of Governors rejected the hiring of Santa Ono, the former president of the University of Michigan.

Idaho Department of Lands considers increase to forest fire protection surcharge

In a press release issued Monday, Forest Service officials said hot weather and dry fuel conditions led them to elevate the fire danger.
“In Very High fire danger, fires can start from most causes,” Forest Service officials said. “The fires can spread rapidly and have a quick increase in intensity, right after ignition. Small fires can quickly become large fires and exhibit extreme fire intensity, such as long-distance spotting and fire whirls.”
The Salmon-Challis National Forest covers about 4.3 million acres of land in Central Idaho and includes part of the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, the Salmon River and Idaho’s highest peak, Mount Borah.
Most wildfires in Idaho are caused by humans, not lightning strikes, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Officials said it is important for the public to play its part in preventing wildfires by properly maintaining and extinguishing campfires.
“These fires can be difficult to control and will often become much larger and longer-lasting fires,” Forest Service officials said.

 State officials say trash can with hot ashes started Idaho’s Clover Fire

Officials with the Idaho Department of Lands announced Tuesday they worked with the Idaho State Fire Marshal to determine that a trash can filled with hot ashes was responsible for starting the Clover Fire that ignited July 13 in Boundary County near Naples, Idaho.
“Heat from the bottom of the metal can caused grass underneath the can to ignite and strong winds quickly carried the fire,” Idaho Department of Lands officials wrote in a press release issued late Monday afternoon.
Before it was contained, the Clover Fire threatened structures and led to evacuations that affected about 30 residences, the Sun previously reported. 
Under Idaho law, the state is allowed to recover actual costs of extinguishing a fire from anyone deemed responsible for that fire.
 



 Officials with the Salmon-Challis National Forest encourage the public to take steps to help protect against wildfire


Always use a campfire ring or fire pan to build a fire, officials said.
Never leave a campfire unattended, officials said. All campfires need to be repeatedly doused with water and stirred so that every ember and all hot spots are extinguished dead out. If the campfire appears too hot to sift through by hand, then it is not completely extinguished and it is too hot to leave, officials said. 
Never shoot into dry vegetation, officials said.
Remove chains or any dangling equipment from vehicles and trailers that could put off a spark, officials said.
Never park on dry vegetation.
Fireworks are always illegal on all public lands, including every campsite in every forest, every day of the year, officials said. 
Carry a shovel and fire extinguisher.
Call 911 or the Central Idaho Fire Dispatch Center at 208-756-5157 to report a wildfire.

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Nearly half of New Mexico’s state legislators on Wednesday received perfect scores from Conservation Voters New Mexico in its annual scorecard, based on lawmakers’ votes in the most recent legislative session.
The organization’s legislative scorecard —which it began releasing in 2005 — awarded 100% to 20 members of the New Mexico Senate and 34 members of the state House — all Democratic.
Recipients included Democratic leadership, such as President Pro Tem Mimi Stewart of Albuquerque and Majority Flood Leader Peter Wirth of Santa Fe in the Senate; and Speaker Javier Martinez and Majority Floor Leader Reena Szczepanski —also of Albuquerque and Santa Fe, respectively — in the House.
Of the 42 Republican elected officials in the state Senate and House, only nine received a score over zero, with the highest scores  — 33% and 29%—going to Rio Rancho state Reps. Joshua Hernandez and Catherine Cullen, respectively.
“At a time when communities are reeling from the harmful actions of the Trump Administration, we’re fortunate to have state lawmakers stepping up to the plate in bold ways to protect our communities and economy,” CVNM Chief Operating Officer Molly Taylor said in a statement. “With nearly half of the legislature receiving the highest mark on the Scorecard, it shows that voters are electing leaders that are ready and willing to fight back against federal cuts and do all they can to protect our democracy and the Land of Enchantment. We express deep gratitude and appreciation to New Mexico’s climate and conservation leaders.”
In a news release,  CVNM said “the number of pro-conservation lawmakers in the New Mexico Roundhouse has been steadily increasing” since it began releasing the scorecard, with the 2023-2023 cycle awarded 48% of lawmakers a perfect score.
The score card evaluated lawmakers’ votes on a variety of legislation within the categories of air quality, effective government, energy and climate change, environmental justice, land, water and wildlife and habitat. Within those categories, the organization highlighted legislation that included Senate Bill 21, the Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Act; and Senate Bill 37, the Strategic Water Reserve.
Strategic Water Supply slides over to Senate

“As seasonal temperatures continue to climb, diminished snowfall and precipitation means less drinking and ground water for our communities,” CVNM Conservation Director Zoe Barker said in a statement. “Although the world around us has changed dramatically, the structures to govern our water management have remained relatively the same. We applaud the legislature for recognizing that Water Can’t Wait, and taking substantial steps to modernize some of our approaches to water management.”
Other bills noted by the organization included: Senate Bill 48, the Community Benefit Fund, which contained $210 million for communities to use for a series of projects to mitigate climate change impacts; and Senate Bill 5, which overhauled the state’s Game and Fish Department.
As states rethink wildlife management, New Mexico offers a new model

CVNM also highlighted legislation that did not pass, including the Immigrant Safety Act and Sensitive Personal Information Nondisclosure bill, noting that “their inclusion in CVNM’s Scorecard highlights the urgency of action needed to advance laws that not only address pollution, but also protect the dignity, safety, and resources of the communities experiencing the most severe impacts of climate change.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/editroundhousepat-e1742047557904-1024x546.jpg,,,2025-07-23 17:57:08.601970

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares on Wednesday declined to provide evidence to support Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s recent claim that more than 2,500 people arrested through the Virginia Homeland Security Task Force were “violent criminals.”
Pressed by The Mercury to confirm whether all those individuals had a history of violent crime during a news conference in Richmond touting dozens of local law enforcement leaders supporting his reelection campaign, Miyares deferred.
“Well, you’re going to have to ask the Secretary of Public Safety,” he said, referring to Terrance Cole, Youngkin’s top homeland security official, who did not attend Wednesday’s event.
The governor made the controversial claim earlier this month while defending a series of courthouse arrests carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, which have drawn sharp criticism from civil rights groups and some local officials. 
Although the state played no direct role in the recent ICE operations at Virginia courthouses, Youngkin praised the federal agency’s work and cast the 2,500 arrests made under his state-federal task force as a public safety triumph.
“Two-thousand five-hundred violent criminals who are here illegally — MS-13 members, Tren de Aragua, others, international violent gang members,” Youngkin said during a press conference at the Virginia State Police headquarters on July 2. “If someone breaks the law and is here illegally, they should be arrested.”
But on Wednesday, Miyares – who is facing Democrat Jay Jones in his bid for a second term as Virginia’s top law enforcement official — offered a more tempered characterization of the individuals targeted, focusing instead on immigration violations, not violent offenses.
“There are those that are here illegally that are committing crimes, and then (in) the second category there’s 1.4 million people that are in this country illegally, that have already had a deportation hearing, they have been in front of a judge,” Miyares said. 
“And under the Biden administration, nothing happened. And so they are now looking at these people that have already had their day in court, and they are seeking for them to actually comply with the court order.”
Miyares delivered his remarks at an event where he announced the endorsement of 78 Virginia sheriffs in his bid for reelection. Surrounded by law enforcement leaders from across the commonwealth, he praised ICE officers and warned that political attacks on immigration agents could lead to violence.
“My biggest concern is you’re going to have a federal agent that’s getting murdered. You’ve already had one that’s been shot,” he said, likely referring to a recent incident where an off-duty U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer was shot in an apparent robbery. “You’ve had a 500% increase in assaults on ICE agents.”
He also emphasized that many undocumented immigrants violate multiple laws when they reenter the country after prior deportation or seek employment in the United States.
“If you reentered the country after you’ve been told to leave, that’s a felony, number one,” Miyares said. “And two, if you were working here, you’d actually commit three different felonies. If you’re an illegal alien and you get a fake Social Security number, you apply for a job, and you’re working, that’s two or three different felonies by itself.”
Miyares’s comments contrast with the sweeping language used by Youngkin, who has described the Homeland Security Task Force as a “national model of success” and a linchpin of Virginia’s partnership with ICE under the 287(g) program, which empowers local and state police to enforce federal immigration laws.
“This is a concerted effort to collaborate with the federal government to make sure that violent criminals that are here illegally are arrested,” Youngkin said previously.
But critics say the task force and ICE’s presence at courthouses have ensnared immigrants with no criminal history and created a chilling effect for victims and witnesses who fear coming to court.
One of those detained in Chesterfield County last month was Salvador Calderon-Cuellar, a man who came to the courthouse to pay a $130 fine for two traffic violations. According to court records, he had no prior arrests. He was arrested by ICE officers who were stationed at a back entrance.
“He had no prior arrests,” Chesterfield Supervisor Jessica Schneider told The Mercury at the time. “Can you tell me that that is a violent criminal person that should be detained?”
Civil rights advocates say the enforcement tactics are politically motivated and erode trust in the justice system.
“The courthouse is a sacred place in a democracy,” Nicole Martin, president of the Chesterfield County NAACP, said last month. “We cannot have a system where people are afraid to show up for hearings, testify as witnesses, or seek protection because ICE might be waiting to detain them.”
Youngkin dismissed such concerns, asserting that ICE agents are avoiding schools and churches and accused the media of distorting the facts. “The media really wants to try to sow deceit,” he said.
However, national reports contradict that claim. In recent months, ICE has conducted arrests outside churches, near schools and even in a school parking lot in Washington, D.C., where officials blocked agents from entering until they presented a warrant.
The Virginia Homeland Security Task Force, launched in February, includes more than 200 officers from the FBI, ICE, Virginia State Police and Department of Corrections. Officials say the task force has focused on gang activity and narcotics trafficking. 
Yet the lack of detailed breakdowns on who has been arrested — and for what crimes — has led to growing scrutiny.
Miyares pointed to his personal ride-along with ICE in 2024 as justification for the program’s aims. 
“It was all individuals that had been picked up, they were here illegally, they had been picked up on crimes,” he said, citing several cases where detainees had been violent offenders. “And so those stories oftentimes aren’t reported, candidly, by our friends in the media.”
Still, immigration researchers note that undocumented immigrants are not more likely to commit crimes than U.S.-born citizens. A 2024 report funded by the National Institute of Justice found that undocumented immigrants in Texas were arrested at significantly lower rates — including for violent crimes — than native-born residents.
For now, Miyares appears to walk a line between defending aggressive enforcement and sidestepping the governor’s more inflammatory rhetoric.
“They have been ordered to leave by a judge,” he said of the individuals detained by ICE at Virginia courthouses. “They’ve had their due process. That’s my understanding of who is being targeted. That shouldn’t be controversial.”

Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) gave her maiden speech on the Senate Floor on Wednesday, using her first formal remarks to the chamber to lay out her plan to deliver for Michigan’s middle class. 
“Michigan is where my family achieved that very American dream. My great grandfather, at 13 years old, came through Ellis Island, not speaking English. 
He ended up starting a meat company, moved to Michigan and built that business and built an iconic hot dog that Michiganders have enjoyed for 60 years,” Slotkin said. 
However, too many families are falling out of the middle class and too many are not able to make it into that group, Slotkin said, noting that Michigan’s factories, farms and small businesses used to serve as a pathway to the middle class. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Over the years, I’ve watched younger generations of those same families live a very different story. Parents can’t provide for their kids what was provided to them. That fishing cabin up north, that dad had, the son can’t have. A trip to Disneyland? Can’t do it. Across Michigan, there are so many families who feel like hard work doesn’t seem to be enough anymore,” Slotkin said. 
Over the past 40 years the middle class has shrunk, Slotkin said, noting she’s personally witnessed what happens when people feel like they cannot get ahead.
“They feel anger, they feel shame, they lose their dignity, and they look for something or someone to blame. In a multi-racial, multi-ethnic experiment in democracy, people end up blaming people who don’t look like them or speak like them or pray like them,” Slotkin said.
In order to understand the anger and polarization in our politics, all you have to do is understand the shrinking middle class, Slotkin said.
In order to revive the middle class, the government needs to get back to the basics, Slotkin said.

“These basics are jobs that pay you enough to save every month, healthcare, you can actually afford a home you can call your own, schools that prepare our kids for the workforce, energy to power our lives, an environment we can pass on to our kids and safety and security from fear. That is it,” Slotkin said.
Looking to jobs, there needs to be job creation for Michigan’s middle class in order to create the jobs of the future, she said, noting that artificial intelligence has the potential to change our economy more than the internet did. 
“Productivity will go up, jobs will be gained, but jobs will also be lost, maybe not Michigan jobs at first, entry level college jobs like paralegals or accountants are probably first on the list. But change is coming, and we need to be ready,” Slotkin said.
Part of that readiness means supporting small businesses, Slotkin said. It also means bringing industries and supply chains back from overseas, Slotkin said, arguing that foreign nations should not get a veto on the nation’s economic security. 
“Finally, let us say it very clearly, we need an immigration system that actually works and is key to our economy. Immigrants are critical for our labor shortages in our factories, in our hospitals, in our firms. More than that, we are a nation of immigrants,” Slotkin said, calling for an immigration plan that brings legal, vetted immigrants into the country and border policy that “makes sense.” 
Looking to health care, Slotkin said there are few things in her mind as broken as the American health care system. 

“Every American deserves access to health care they can afford regardless of your job, regardless of your income or your age. So I support a nationwide public insurance plan, at a reasonable price, for every American,” she said. 
Additionally, in every part of the American health care system, we need to be able to negotiate the cost of drugs, Slotkin said, speaking out against the influence of corporate money in politics. 
Looking to housing, Slotkin noted that the U.S. Senate, today, could declare a housing state of emergency, calling for Michigan to be the ground zero in responding to the need for 4 million units of housing across the nation. 
America needs to make sure schools are actually preparing kids for the future, Slotkin said, calling for an overhaul of federal job training programs. 
Additionally she warned that without a plan on energy now, Americans could be seeing rolling blackouts and brownouts in a decade. 
She called for an all of the above energy plan, criticizing conservative politicians for opposing certain energy sources – like solar and wind – because they are “woke.”
Michiganders have also been tasked with the stewardship of the Great Lakes, Slotkin stressed, before noting the tangible impacts of climate change on the state.

Photograph by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout ©2025A federal judge in Nashville ruled Wednesday that Kilmar Abrego Garcia must be released from criminal custody in Tennessee pending trial on human smuggling charges.
The order came shortly after a Maryland court, in a separate case, blocked Immigration and Customs Enforcement from immediately taking Abrego into custody once released in Tennessee. 
The twin court orders represent a victory for Abrego and his attorneys, who have been fighting for his right to pretrial release in Tennessee while also seeking legal safeguards to prevent Trump administration officials from following through on threats to send him to a “third country.” 
The timing of Abrego’s physical release from custody remains unknown. 
Before Wednesday’s rulings, both federal prosecutors and Abrego’s attorneys in the Tennessee case preemptively sought a 30-day delay if the court granted his release. The delay, they said, was intended to prevent Trump administration officials from immediately dispatching Abrego to an unnamed country.  
A federal magistrate judge late Wednesday granted their 30-day-delay request.
“Issuance of the order directing Abrego’s release with conditions is STAYED for 30 days, subject to further order,” federal Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes ruled.

“Abrego shall therefore remain in the custody of the United States Marshal pending further order, as previously directed,” she wrote. U.S. Marshals oversee pre-trial detainees in federal cases. 
Attorneys for Abrego did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the rulings.
Abrego, a Maryland construction worker, was mistakenly sent to a Salvadoran prison in March after a routine traffic stop led to his detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Originally from El Salvador, Abrego entered the U.S. illegally more than a decade ago but in 2019 secured an order from an immigration judge that barred his deportation to his home country where, he said, he feared gang violence.
Abrego’s mistaken deportation to a notorious Salvadoran prison served to highlight the lack of due process protections for immigrants caught up in the Trump administration’s mass immigration crackdowns. A federal prosecutor who acknowledged Abrego was deported in error was subsequently fired and has since filed a whistleblower complaint. 
Trump administration officials refused to return Abrego to the United States for months, even after the Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s ruling ordering the administration to facilitate his return. 
It was only after intense public interest in his case that the Tennessee human smuggling charges were filed against Abrego in June. 
The charges are linked to a 2022 traffic stop that prosecutors now say intercepted Abrego’s job chauffeuring immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally to points around the country. 
Abrego has entered not guilty pleas to the two human smuggling charges. 
Separately, his attorneys are seeking a court order barring Trump administration officials from publicly discussing his case after Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called Abrego a “monster” and “horrible human being” who “should never be released free.”
Noem made the remarks July 18 at a Homeland Security field office in Nashville where, she said, she was highlighting the “worst of the worst” immigrants who had committed crimes.

“These comments — made by a sitting cabinet secretary (and one of the Nation’s highest ranking law enforcement officials) in this District, mere miles from the courthouse where Mr. Abrego’s case is pending — are precisely of the type that are most likely to prejudice Mr. Abrego’s right to a fair trial,” Abrego’s attorneys wrote. 
“Secretary Noem assailed Mr. Abrego’s character and reputation, including with verbal insults and allegations that are irrelevant to the offenses charged in the indictment and almost certainly inadmissible at trial.”
Attorneys for Abrego noted they had formally requested a retraction of the remarks on July 21 but had received no response.
Abrego’s lawyers are seeking a court order that clarifies that the Department of Homeland Security and other government officials are barred by standing court rules from discussing the case publicly. Federal prosecutors have not yet filed a reply to their petition.

Blue symbols indicate events that occurred as part of swarms, while red indicates non-swarm seismicity. Map courtesy of the University of Utah Seismograph Stations. (Public domain, USGS)Although they mostly go unnoticed by humans, small earthquakes occur much more frequently than large earthquakes, and knowing more about these tiny seismic events can help us better understand the earthquake hazard and geological processes occurring in a region.
Using conventional methods to measure the magnitude of small earthquakes in Yellowstone, however, can be challenging. But perhaps Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches offer a solution. After all, AI is already helping to refine earthquake location procedures in Yellowstone.
Earthquake magnitudes are calculated from the energy released by the earthquake as recorded by a seismometer. In Yellowstone, the University of Utah Seismograph Stations operates a network of seismometers to monitor earthquakes in the area. Generally, magnitude measurements for a single earthquake are made at several stations in the network independently, and the estimates are then averaged into the final magnitude that is reported. Accurately computing magnitude values for small earthquakes becomes challenging when: 1) there are not enough measurements; or 2) earthquakes are happening close together. This is a particular problem during swarms of small earthquakes because the signals from individual seismic events can overlap. Usually, this can be fixed by a seismic analyst after they locate the earthquake, but not always. About 2% of the earthquakes in the University of Utah Seismograph Stations catalog do not have a magnitude computed, likely because of a combination of these issues, so the value is reported as -9.99.
  Example of a Yellowstone seismic waveform recorded at station YMC (at Maple Creek in the northeast part of Yellowstone National Park) with earthquakes for which a magnitude could not be determined. The magnitude was therefore set at -9.99 in the University of Utah Seismograph Stations catalog. The gold area highlights one event, but there are several others close by. The entire window is less than one 1 minute long. The close occurrence of several earthquakes in such a short time window and their small magnitude values make it a challenge to calculate an earthquake magnitude for any of these events.
To solve this problem, let’s reach into our AI toolkit!
 
Most people are likely familiar with complicated “deep learning” models, like ChatGPT, that accept and output complex data like long text sequences and images. The deep learning models we use in processing small earthquakes are similar, and they take ground motion data from seismometers as the input. Deep learning models like these are a type of machine learning, which describes algorithms that learn patterns in a dataset to estimate values of interest for new data. The models learn the patterns during a training phase, in which the model is provided with examples—sort of like a test with an answer key. After training, the model can accept inputs it has never seen before and estimate the output, given what it learned from the training data.
There is also a somewhat simpler, though still powerful, type of machine learning that relies on human-defined features that describe the data instead of the more complicated, raw data to make predictions. In a recent study, University of Utah scientists used this method to train models to calculate earthquake magnitudes based on short windows of data, so it won’t generally be a problem if earthquakes are close together.
In the new approach, the UUSS scientists trained one machine learning model for each station in the Yellowstone region using data from the UUSS earthquake catalog. Each model uses features describing the earthquake signal—such as the amplitude—and the location of the earthquake to estimate a magnitude value. The new method makes better use of the available data by accounting for multiple types of seismic waves, and the method also can take advantage of data from more seismic stations because of the rigorous training step. The net result is that there are as many as four times the measurements available to calculate a magnitude. Like in the conventional approach, these measurements are combined to determine a final magnitude.
 
The new method will ultimately complement, and not replace, the traditional approach for magnitude calculations. This is because traditional methods work very well most of the time (except for these small, nearby events), and because the machine learning approach does have its limitations, mostly because the models are only going to work well for earthquakes that are similar to the training dataset. So, for example, a model may fail to estimate the magnitude of an earthquake occurring near Hebgen Lake if it saw very few training examples from that area. Similarly, if most training examples were greater than M0.5, the model may perform poorly when applied to earthquakes with a magnitude less than 0.5. Combining predictions from multiple station models can help us to remove and identify poor magnitude estimates, but it can be challenging to know when the models are uncertain. In the future, seismic station scientists plan to expand the approach to not only provide a magnitude, but also an assessment of the confidence in that magnitude.
These machine learning methods are at the current cutting edge of seismology, and Yellowstone provides the perfect location to train and test the new approaches.

Free.,"Trump illegally withheld Head Start payments, government watchdog says",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-illegally-withheld-head-start-payments-government-watchdog-says,,"The Health and Human Services Department illegally withheld payments from Head Start for the first months of President Donald Trump’s term, a government watchdog reported Wednesday.HHS payments for Head Start this year were significantly behind schedule compared with 2024. That violated the Impoundment Control Act, a law governing the president’s duty to spend congressionally appropriated funds, according to a report from the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office.The law, sometimes called the ICA, allows the president to withhold appropriated funds in some circumstances. But the publicly available data did not show those conditions were met and HHS did not mount any defense prior to the report’s publication, according to the GAO.“Because that evidence indicates that HHS withheld appropriated funds from expenditure, and because the burden to justify such withholdings rests with HHS and the executive branch, we conclude that HHS violated the ICA by withholding funds,” the report said.Before the report’s publication, HHS did not provide the GAO with information requested by the watchdog or a legal analysis, according to the report, which was signed by GAO General Counsel Edda Emmanuelli Perez.However, an HHS spokesperson told States Newsroom in a Wednesday email that it would respond to the GAO and disputed the report’s conclusion.“HHS did not impound Head Start funds and disputes the conclusion of the GAO report,” the spokesperson wrote. “GAO should anticipate a forthcoming response from HHS to incorporate into an updated report.”How Head Start worksHead Start is a federal grant program to fund pre-kindergarten services for low-income families. The federal government provides up to 80% of a local program’s eligible costs, the report said. As of last year, 1,600 organizations received Head Start funding for education, nutritional, health and social services.Organizations receiving Head Start funding generally win grant approvals for five years at a time. Programs in good standing are automatically renewed, according to the report.Mere days after Trump took office in January, dozens of Head Start grant recipients found they were unable to access funds they’d expected from HHS, according to a Jan. 28 statement from the National Head Start Association, a coalition of grantees.GAO’s analysis showed the department disbursed about one-third less grant funding in the first three months of the Trump administration than it had over the same period in 2024. The difference amounted to $825 million less for Head Start grants over those months.The law does allow for HHS to stop funding for grantees before the end of the five-year period under certain circumstances, such as for failing to meet performance standards or becoming under-enrolled.In those cases, though, HHS must warn the programs of potential cuts in grants, provide a detailed plan the organization can implement to avoid grant cancellation and give the grantee a fair hearing as well as the ability to apply for refunding — all before funding can be cut off, according to the GAO report.There is no indication HHS took any of those steps before abruptly cutting funds in January, according to the report.‘The president is not a king’Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, blasted President Donald Trump and his HHS in a lengthy statement that asserted Congress’ power over spending decisions and admonished the administration for harming an important program for working families.“Trump has signaled he would like to eliminate Head Start—but that’s not his choice to make,” Murray said. “Congress delivered this funding for Head Start on a bipartisan basis, and instead of trying to destroy preschool programs and breaking our laws to hurt working families, President Trump needs to ensure every penny of these funds get out in a timely, consistent way moving forward—and he must also finally get out the rest of the investments he has been robbing the American people of.”Oregon Democrat Jeff Merkley, the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, highlighted Congress’ role in directing federal funding, calling on Trump and White House Budget Director Russell Vought to comply with appropriations laws.“The President is not a king, and laws are not suggestions,” Merkley said in a statement. “Once again, we’re seeing proof that this administration is in clear violation of the law under the Impoundment Control Act. The funds appropriated by Congress are not merely suggestions for Donald Trump and Russ Vought to ignore – these are funds that hardworking families rely on, and Head Start is essential to making sure the doors of opportunity are open to every child in our country.”ACLU lawsuitThe GAO report did not list any further action the agency would take but did note that litigation over the withheld funding is ongoing.The American Civil Liberties Union filed a suit in April in federal court in Seattle that included parents and Head Start grant recipients.The suit described widespread confusion that Head Start organizations experienced when they could not access expected federal funding, compounded by cuts to support staff in regional offices.No cooperationThe report detailed the lack of participation by HHS in the GAO’s investigation and tied it to a separate legal fight involving a public website.“HHS has not provided the information we requested regarding factual information and its legal views concerning the potential impoundment of appropriated funds,” the report said.Without information from the administration, the watchdog based its findings on publicly available data.The White House Office of Management and Budget added an obstacle to that task, the watchdog said.The office “removed agency apportionment data from its public websites, which is both contrary to OMB’s duty to make such information publicly available and to GAO’s statutory authority to access such information,” the GAO report said.On that question, a federal judge on Monday ordered the Trump administration to once again publish details about the pace at which it plans to spend money approved by Congress.U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Judge Emmet Sullivan wrote in his ruling that Congress “has sweeping authority” to require the president to post a website detailing how it doles out taxpayer dollars throughout the year.",,,,2025-07-23 17:57:08.601970

As an initial matter, the Court agrees with Abrego that the nature of the crimes he is accused of do not, on their own, fall within the categories of crimes Congress specifically enumerated as warranting a presumption of detention,” Crenshaw, appointed by President Barack Obama, wrote in a 37-page opinion.In a separate ruling in Maryland Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered that authorities cannot immediately take Abrego Garcia into custody upon his release in Tennessee.Xinis granted Abrego Garcia’s emergency request to return to his home state of Maryland while he awaits trial. Federal authorities previously told Xinis they intended to swiftly arrest Abrego Garcia, if released, on an immigration detainer. “Accordingly, the Court shares Plaintiffs’ ongoing concern that, absent meaningful safeguards, Defendants may once again remove Abrego Garcia from the United States without having restored him to the status quo ante and without due process. Thus, additional relief is necessary,” Xinis, an Obama appointee, wrote in her 18-page order. Xinis’ order requires Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, to return Abrego Garcia to the agency’s order of supervision in Baltimore, the jurisdiction of his original immigration proceedings. If ICE initiates his removal to a third country, the authorities must provide 72 hours notice of the destination to Garcia and his legal counsel.Sent to CECOTICE arrested and detained Abrego Garcia in Maryland on March 12, and days later sent him among hundreds of other migrants on legally contested deportation flights to CECOT.Abrego Garcia has detailed psychological and physical torture he experienced at the notorious prison.Upon returning Abrego Garcia to the U.S., the Justice Department indicted him on human smuggling charges, stemming from the 2019 traffic stop. His attorneys maintain the Trump administration used the indictment to save face in light of court orders finding Abrego Garcia's deportation unlawful and the Supreme Court’s order for the federal government to facilitate his return.Abrego Garcia has had deportation protections in place since 2019, barring authorities from sending him back to his native El Salvador due to concerns he would experience gang violence there.",,,,2025-07-23 17:57:08.601970

(Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)The state Department of Natural Resources made its first arrest under a recent law intended to help rid the state’s waterways of abandoned boats.
Samuel Kodaimati, 64, was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of leaving a decommissioned 120-foot U.S. Navy torpedo vessel in Bohicket Creek near Johns Island, the natural resources agency said in a news release. If convicted, Kodaimati could be ordered to pay up to $43,400 in fines and fees involved with removing the boat, according to the agency.
As of Wednesday afternoon, Kodaimati remained in the Charleston County jail. Bond has been set at $2,174.
The boat that DNR officials linked to Kodaimati has been sitting in a marsh near a private dock since at least 2021, when the Coast Guard issued an order deeming it inoperable under federal maritime law for lacking proper documentation, according to the news release.
Leaving the vessel in the salt marsh ecosystem posed a threat for the fish, shellfish and shorebirds that live in the marsh, as well as the quality of the water that filters through it. The Coast Guard deemed the boat an environmental hazard last year and removed about 3,500 gallons of oil and oily water from it, according to the news release.
“This arrest underscores our commitment to protecting South Carolina’s natural resources and holding accountable those who jeopardize them,” agency director Tom Mullikin said in a news release. “Abandoning vessels in sensitive waterways not only violates the law but also puts our ecosystems, wildlife, and communities at risk.”
No one answered phone numbers possibly connected to Kodaimati. It is unclear whether he has hired an attorney to represent him.
Abandoning boats for any reason other than an emergency has been a misdemeanor since 2008, but that law didn’t stop people from leaving their boats in the state’s waterways. The law passed unanimously in May creates a specific process for DNR and other law enforcement agencies to remove boats left in public waters and increases the penalties for those convicted.
Once law enforcement officers have been notified of a boat left in a waterway for 10 days, if it has no identification — or 21 days if it does — they must try to contact the owner and put a notice on the boat deeming it abandoned. The owner then has three weeks to move the vessel or submit a reasonable plan to do so. Otherwise, officials can remove and dispose of the boat, as well as charge its owner with a misdemeanor, according to the law.
The boat’s owner, if convicted, can be fined up to $10,000, put in prison for up to 60 days, or both.
That’s double the previous maximum fine of $5,000 or prison sentence of 30 days. The law also stipulates the owner is responsible for paying any costs that come from removing the boat, taking the onus off the state to cover expensive removals.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_1861-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-23 17:57:08.601970

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Student proficiency scores are likely to drop when reading and math test scores are released Friday, officials said. 
“It doesn’t actually mean students got less smart this year compared to last year,” said Megan Oftedal, executive director of Oklahoma Office of Educational Quality and Accountability. “It’s really just that the standard for the cut scores last year, the bar was lower.”
Educators and parents will have more transparent information about where students stand with proficiency, and it can “spark” conversations about what students need to be ready for college or a career, Oftedal said. 
The goal is to provide a more accurate comparison of how Oklahoma public school students are performing versus their national peers, she said. 
Oklahoma’s Commission for Educational Quality and Accountability in May returned the academic expectations for student scores to 2023 levels, a year after the state quietly lowered the bar that public school students must achieve to be considered proficient. The proficiency expectations, or cut scores, set the standard of what knowledge students should be able to demonstrate on annual state tests to be considered proficient. 
Oftedal’s agency advised that this year’s results should not be directly compared to last year’s as the 2024 expectations were an “outlier” developed using a process that did not incorporate national comparisons. 
Preliminary Oklahoma School Testing Program scores for grade school students will be available to educators Friday and to parents Aug. 1. 
School report cards could also be impacted, Oftedal said, and it’s likely a decline in school scores will be reflected there as well. 
Quinton Hitchcock, a spokesperson for the Oklahoma State Department of Education, declined to answer questions about potential declines in scores or how it could affect school accreditation as the scores have yet to be released. 
The now defunct expectations created a “divergence” between the state’s expectations and national testing standards, which is called an “honesty gap.” 
Oklahoma worked to close the gap beginning in 2017 by aligning with national standards, but the gap widened again in 2024 when new benchmarks were approved.

(Photo by Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent)OKLAHOMA CITY – An anti-abortion group is asking the Oklahoma Supreme Court to uphold a new law putting more restrictions on the initiative petition process after residents in other states used it to expand abortion access.
Oklahomans for Life is arguing that Senate Bill 1027 should be allowed to stand because the new requirements it adds to the initiative petition process will help expose the powerful national interests working to infiltrate local lawmaking.
Oklahoma has some of the strictest abortion laws in the nation, allowing the procedure only to save the life of the mother.
But since the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 ruling that allowed states to determine abortion access, “abortion-rights groups have increasingly turned to well-financed ballot initiatives to override duly-elected state legislatures and enact constitutional protections for abortion access,” the group wrote in its brief.
“In several states, these campaigns have been pushed by national organizations with virtually unlimited resources and whose messaging is often tailored to appear local, moderate, or non-partisan,” according to the proposed brief.
Critics argue Senate Bill 1027 is unconstitutional and have sued to block it.
The law, which remains in effect, limits how many signatures can be gathered in each county, restricting participation in the state’s most populated areas.
It prohibits paying petition circulators based on the number of signatures collected, requires sources of payment to circulators to be disclosed and bars out-of-state interests from donating.
Those circulating the petition must also be registered voters in Oklahoma. 
Voters in five states, including Nevada, Arizona, Montana, Colorado and Missouri, approved citizen-initiated ballot measures in 2024 that protected the right to abortion, while voters in three states — Nebraska, Florida and South Dakota — rejected measures, according to KFF.  Nebraska voters that same year approved a citizen-led measure banning abortion after the first trimester.
Sen. Julie Daniels, R-Bartlesville, said an initiative petition seeking to legalize abortion in Oklahoma was a concern when lawmakers crafted Senate Bill 1027.
But it can go beyond just abortion, she said.
Some progressive organizations with deep pockets are using the process to achieve policy goals they could not otherwise attain due to the makeup of the Legislature, she said.
Republicans have super majorities in both legislative chambers and control all statewide offices.
Oklahomans for Life Chairman Tony Lauinger could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
In 2022, two Tulsa and one Bixby residents filed papers with the Oklahoma Secretary of State indicating a desire to circulate an initiative petition seeking to legalize abortion in Oklahoma. A few weeks later, they withdrew it.
Amber England, who has worked on initiative petitions, said she is not aware of any official effort to put an abortion question on the ballot.
“It is my strong belief the Legislature has effectively neutered our constitutional right to the initiative process,” she said.

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-23 21:05:42+00:00,Mississippi Today,Lawmaker praises federal OK of quicker Medicaid coverage for prenatal care,Gwen Dilworth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/23/medicaid-prenatal-care-presumptive-eligibility/,"Low-income women in Mississippi could receive quicker Medicaid coverage for prenatal care, after a federal agency approved the state's law on presumptive eligibility.","A key Mississippi lawmaker says low-income pregnant women should soon receive faster access to medical services because the federal government has approved a Mississippi law that was on hold for more than a year.
“We know that prenatal care is critical for pregnant women,” House Medicaid Committee Chairwoman Missy McGee, a Republican from Hattiesburg, said Wednesday. “It will give them the best opportunity to deliver a healthy, full-term baby.”
The law allows pregnant women to be presumed eligible for Medicaid coverage while their applications are pending. It was first passed in 2024 but has been stalled because of a discrepancy between state and federal requirements. 
Mississippi lawmakers revised the state requirements this year to match federal guidelines. The new bill became law without Republican Gov. Tate Reeves’ signature in March, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved the policy Thursday.
Women will be able to take advantage of the program after providers are trained to make eligibility determinations, Mississippi Medicaid spokesperson Matt Westerfield said Wednesday. The agency aims to schedule training sessions for early August.
McGee led efforts to enact the policy. She said it aims to ensure pregnant women have the opportunity to see a doctor in the early weeks of pregnancy in a state with some of the nation’s highest infant and maternal mortality rates.
Without presumptive eligibility, pregnant women who are eligible for Medicaid must go without care or pay out of pocket while they wait for their application to be processed. 
The preterm birth rate in Mississippi is 15% – the highest in the nation, according to March of Dimes. Over 13% of Mississippi women did not receive prenatal care until the fifth month of pregnancy or later in 2024, meaning they received less than 50% of the appropriate number of recommended visits during pregnancy. 
Medicaid funds 57% of births in Mississippi, the second highest share in the nation after Louisiana. 
To be eligible for the program, women must be at or below 194% of the federal poverty level – an income of about $31,000 for one person or about $53,000 for a family of three. Those approved will receive 60 days of coverage for outpatient care while their application is processed. The average processing time for Mississippi Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program applications is 16 days, Westerfield said.
Providers must complete an application and undergo eligibility determination training before they are approved by the Mississippi Division of Medicaid to participate in the program, according to an explainer published on the agency’s website in 2024. 
Sixteen providers are currently approved and trained for the program, Westerfield said. They will be retrained alongside any newly applied providers.
The Division of Medicaid will make a list of providers available on its website after they are trained, he said. 
McGee said the next step will be for providers, county health departments and Medicaid managed care organizations to educate people who are eligible to seek the benefit of the program.
The 2024 legislation included a proof of income requirement, which the CMS did not allow, maintaining instead that vocal testimony should suffice for eligibility determination purposes.
McGee said alterations to the law, which included removing the proof of income and proof of pregnancy requirements, did not change its intent. 
“The simplest thing was to make those fixes,” she said.
Legislators also passed a law in 2023 that gives mothers Medicaid coverage for one year after they give birth. 
Mississippi joins other states that passed presumptive eligibility bills this year, including Alabama and Arkansas. 
McGee said she is pleased Mississippi’s presumptive eligibility for pregnant women has finally received federal approval.
“We felt this was imperative and a very important step towards getting off the top of some very negative lists,” she said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/06072315/3X0A0947-scaled.jpg,,,2025-07-23 17:57:08.601970

Under the agreement, Josephine Edmonds, 63, would be sentenced to a three-year suspended sentence with three years probation when she goes before Judge Tracy Lee Dayton on Sept. 25. Edmonds was facing four felony charges, including witness tampering and illegal possession of absentee ballots stemming from the 2019 election.
After the hearing, her attorney Public Defender James Pastore said his client was just a small part of an election machine.
“Miss Edmonds was a minor player here and it is unfair that the people directing this aren’t being held accountable,” Pastore said. “Her actions had no effect on the outcome of the election.”
The charges against Edmonds stem from a case involving a family she knew that she assisted in filling out absentee ballots in the 2019 mayoral election and then taking and mailing them. Edmonds was working for Democrat Marilyn Moore in that primary election.
She also was charged with witness tampering when the family informed her they had been subpoenaed to testify at a civil trial after that election and she tried to convince them not to mention her name.
The only other defendant to appear Tuesday was City Councilwoman Maria Pereira who told the judge she wanted to fire her attorney Dean E. Popkin and get a new one.
Dayton granted the request after Popkin said the relationship with Pereira had deteriorated to the point he felt he could no longer properly represent her.
Dayton set a new court date for Pereira for Aug. 11 and ordered a new public defender be appointed to represent her.
Pereira is one of two sitting city council members facing election fraud charges for either misrepresenting who is eligible to vote absentee, fraudulent voting, taking possession of voters’ absentee ballots or being present while voters filled out those ballots. 
They were charged by the Chief State’s Attorney’s office last year for events that took place in the 2023 election cycle.
Council member Alfredo Castillo is facing five counts of misrepresenting eligibility requirements for voting by absentee ballot and five counts of being present when an absentee ballot applicant executes an absentee ballot and eight counts of possession of ballots and envelopes. Former council member Jazmarie Melendez is facing six felony counts.
The three other defendants are Wanda Geter-Pataky, Margaret Joyce and Nilsa Heredia. All had their cases continued until Aug. 13.
Dayton said previously that on that court date she expects plea negotiations to occur with the other five defendants to see if a resolution to the cases can be reached, otherwise a trial date will be set. 
Geter-Pataky, the vice chair of the city’s Democratic Town Committee, is facing 92 separate criminal charges, including conspiracy to take possession of multiple voters’ absentee ballots. 
Heredia is facing similar charges as Edmonds from the 2019 election but has not entered plea discussions with the state yet.
Her attorney Ken Krayeske had applied for accelerated rehabilitation — a form of probation — for Heredia but was denied by Dayton, who signaled the case was not going to be business as usual.
Dayton said that allegations of election fraud and voter manipulation were serious matters comparable to cases stemming from the embezzlement of public funds.
Meanwhile, Joyce, who lists no permanent address, was recently fined $1,000 by the State Elections Enforcement Commission for what they described as an “egregious” violation of state law for her actions in the 2024 Bridgeport elections. 
Joyce is currently facing nine criminal charges from the state’s investigation of the 2023 elections.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/edmondscourt-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-23 17:57:08.601970

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)Standing next to U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Idaho Gov. Brad Little on Wednesday declared next month as “Keep Idaho Healthy Month.”
Kennedy, also known as RFK Jr., called Idaho the “home of medical freedom.” He is visiting Idaho to talk with state officials about work to promote his movement called Make America Health Again, or MAHA, and to celebrate Idaho’s progress on it, officials for the Idaho governor’s office said. 
“Idaho proudly leads the nation in ushering in the” MAHA movement, says Little’s proclamation, which declares August 2025 as “Keep Idaho Healthy Month.”

Little said Idaho had embraced the movement before it even had a name. He touted recent new laws that established a broad right to medical freedom that bans requirements for vaccines or other medical interventions, and prompted Idaho to request permission from the federal government to ban soda and candy from a food assistance program.
MAHA is “kind of in our ethos in Idaho, before we had a name to it. And you get credit for the name,” Little said of Kennedy.

“To me, it’s the right thing to do for one … person,” the governor said. “It’s even more the right thing to do for their families. And I think the president and the secretary have talked about it’s a patriotic duty to do for the whole country.” 
Officials did not take questions from journalists at the event. 
Kennedy and Little will also meet with tribal leaders about how the Trump administration and Idaho are addressing mental health needs on Native American reservations, governor’s office officials say.
 US Health Secretary RFK Jr. critiques pandemic control measures, but praised Idaho

For years, Kennedy has doubted the safety of vaccines. The Trump administration recently restricted vaccines through a series of regulatory decisions in ways that sometimes counter established scientific consensus, the Associated Press reported. 
In brief remarks in the Idaho governor’s office, Kennedy criticized COVID pandemic control measures during the Biden administration, before shifting to the need to address chronic illnesses in America. 
But he praised Little’s actions in Idaho.
“Idaho did better than any other state in preserving those essential American freedoms. And a lot of that was because of the leadership of Gov. Little,” Kennedy said.
During the COVID pandemic, Little temporarily limited public gatherings and closed some businesses. But months later in 2020 he ended the order and refused calls for a statewide mask mandate. 
This year, Little signed into law a bill banning mask mandates to combat infectious disease by governments and schools. 
Minutes before Kennedy and Little spoke in the governor’s ceremonial office, protestors standing on the front steps of the Idaho State Capitol Building chanted “Vaccines save lives.”
As Little read his new proclamation, faint shouts from protestors outside his office carried through the room. After the event, protestors chanted: “Hey, hey, RFK. How many kids did you kill today?”

“The work that we're doing is going to be in even higher demand,” said Community Harvest of Central Vermont director Allison Levin.

At Dog River Farm on Tuesday, Allison Levin and three volunteers salvaged nearly 150 pounds of rainbow chard which would otherwise have been destroyed. 
Next, staff at Community Harvest of Central Vermont, of which Levin is founding executive director, will deliver those vegetables to local groups which provide food assistance near the Berlin farm — Capstone Community Action in Barre and the Montpelier Food Pantry, among others. In Montpelier, people have been lining up for hours before Levin’s Tuesday morning deliveries, which represent a large fraction of the fresh produce offered by the city’s food pantry, she said.
Community Harvest is one of a number of such organizations in Vermont which work both to strengthen nutrition assistance programs and to lessen food waste. Often, they are nonprofits which receive little or no public support. But as food assistance becomes more stretched in Vermont, and public funding for farmed food dwindles, local leaders say gleaning is an important way to help meet the state’s needs.
With thousands of Vermonters potentially set to lose Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits over the next few years — an outcome of sweeping federal cuts to the program — Levin thinks there will be greater need for gleaning work in the state.

“The work that we’re doing is going to be in even higher demand,” she said.
Gleaning is the practice of retrieving produce, or food more generally, that would otherwise go to waste. The produce Levin collects consists of what farmers call “seconds” — a fraction of the yield that isn’t flawless enough to sell in most grocery stores. The vegetables are still safe and edible, they just have dimples, bends or other deformities.
George Gross, who owns Dog River Farm, said without the service Levin provides, he would have to simply till the abandoned plants back into the soil. 
Waiting for gleaners to arrive can be costly for farmers, Gross said, because growing seasons are short and the small nonprofits “can only do so much.” Produce donors across the state have also told gleaners that public reimbursement for donated produce would be helpful. But for Gross, it is important that his produce goes to good use, and equally that it stays local in Levin’s small network of partners.

“I want this food to stay in my community,” he said.
Gabe Zoerheide, the executive director of Willing Hands in Norwich, said he combines field work and garden crops with in-kind donations and wholesale recovery to deliver roughly a million pounds of food a year. 
Perishable food is a crucial part of any response to food insecurity, he said, not least because fresh products tend to be more expensive to purchase. Willing Hands provides nearly half the fresh produce at Upper Valley Haven, one of the largest food pantries in the state. In total, Zoerheide’s team delivers to about 80 recipient organizations in Vermont and New Hampshire.
“This can provide a source of nutritious food to (clients) that they can count on,” said Michael Redmond, the executive director of Upper Valley Haven, which also operates temporary shelters in White River Junction.

But in areas farther north, gleaning programs sometimes have a less robust presence.
Amy Hornblas, executive director at the Neighbors in Action food pantry in Cabot and Lyndonville, said agricultural gleaning feels like an untapped resource in the area. At the moment, Hornblas said, her organization doesn’t receive much gleaned produce, but she hopes to change that.
Neighbors in Action recently drew attention for drawing such high demand that the Lyndon selectboard grew concerned about the volume of traffic through downtown. Caledonia, Essex, and Orleans counties all show higher rates of poverty and food insecurity than the state averages, according to a 2023 Northeast Kingdom Human Services report. 
“There is an abundance of food,” said Hornblas in reference to surrounding farms. “We just gotta move it.”

Hillary Hust-Barber, the gleaning manager at Salvation Farms, said her team of two full-time employees is currently covering all of Lamoille Valley and the Northeast Kingdom.
Hust-Barber is also the administrator for the Vermont Gleaning Collective, which onboards volunteers and shares information between the state’s food recovery organizations. Neighbors in Action will host an event Aug. 9 at Salvation Farms in Morrisville to gather volunteers for gleaning in the area.
Richie Hourihan, owner of Cabot Smith Farm and donor to Salvation Farms, agreed it was a matter of labor. Up to 20% of his yield can be seconds, but he can’t collect it himself.
And the food, he said, ought to be salvaged. “All vegetables are perfect,” Hourihan said.
Although gleaning networks can play an important role in bolstering food access across Vermont, their leaders acknowledge that local food assistance systems cannot fully replace the scale of federal programs. Even though the work he does is important, Redmond said, it is “dwarfed” by the resourcing behind programs like SNAP.
Zoerheide agreed. 
“I’m not going to pretend that we can make up the difference, but we are committed as an organization to do everything we can to meet more of the need,” he said.

(Photo by Ariel Skelley/Getty Photos)As the federal government and states move to cut about $1 trillion over the next decade from Medicaid, researchers estimate annual impacts by 2034 of hundreds of thousands of jobs lost and billions less in state and local tax revenue.
The research published this month in the peer-reviewed journal JAMA Health Forum looked at the long-term economic effects of the Medicaid provisions in President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending bill, which cuts the joint state-federal health insurance program for people with lower incomes or with disabilities and provides tax cuts that disproportionately benefit wealthier Americans.
Medicaid cuts are likely to worsen mental health care in rural America

By 2034, the researchers estimated annual economic impacts to reach 302 000 jobs lost and $135.3 billion in reduced economic output, leading to $11.1 billion in annual state and local tax revenue reductions.
Coverage losses could generate $7.6 billion in medical debt, triggering a further $3.8 billion reduction in economic activity, the study said.
As the single largest source of health coverage in the nation that covers 72 million people — or a fifth of the U.S. population — Medicaid is a key source of revenue to health care providers, as well as a significant funding stream for health facilities. Hospitals are major employers and drivers of local economies.
In New York, for example, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul’s office estimates that 65,000 jobs could be lost due to cuts in hospitals and community health centers, as well as a loss of $14.4 billion in hospital-related economic activity.

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)A panel of federal judges on Tuesday named a new top federal prosecutor for New Jersey, effectively booting Alina Habba from the job she has held — amid escalating uproar — on an interim basis since March.
But within hours, top Trump administration officials disregarded the judicial order and removed Habba’s replacement, Desiree Leigh Grace, who had been Habba’s second-in-command. White House officials rebuked the “politically minded judges” who had declined to extend Habba’s service until the Senate could vote on her confirmation.
“This Department of Justice does not tolerate rogue judges — especially when they threaten the President’s core Article II powers,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi wrote on social media Tuesday evening.
Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche seconded that sentiment.
“The district judges in NJ just proved this was never about law—it was about politics,” he posted on social media. “They forced out President Trump’s pick (Habba), then installed her deputy, colluding with the NJ Senators along the way. It won’t work. Pursuant to the President’s authority, we have removed that deputy, effective immediately. This backroom vote will not override the authority of the Chief Executive.”
The leadership boomerang sparked widespread confusion about both who’s leading the office and whether the White House or the courts — meant to act as checks on one another — would prevail.
Habba’s 120-day tenure as acting U.S. attorney expires this week. Federal law gives district judges the power to name a U.S. attorney if the Senate does not act on a president’s nominee within 120 days. President Donald Trump nominated her for a full term last month.
Blanche had urged federal judges to keep Habba in the post, praising her “steady leadership and sound judgment” on Sunday on social media. She had the “full confidence” of Trump and the Department of Justice, Blanche wrote.
But Judge Renée Marie Bumb, chief jurist in the U.S. District Court based in Camden, announced Grace as Habba’s replacement in a terse order Tuesday afternoon, offering no insights into the court’s decision. Grace has worked at the U.S. Attorney’s Office since 2016 and became first assistant under Habba.
Habba has drawn widespread criticism during her four-month tenure, most rooted in her prosecutions of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver, both Democrats whose arrests stemmed from their May visit to an immigrant jail in Newark. Her office has reportedly subpoenaed Gov. Phil Murphy, also a Democrat, over comments he made in February that suggested he might hide an undocumented immigrant in his home.
New Jersey’s senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, both Democrats, had objected to Habba taking the job permanently, accusing her earlier this month of using the office to pursue “frivolous and politically motivated prosecutions.”
Booker and Kim issued a joint statement Tuesday evening criticizing the Trump administration for firing Grace, saying it is part of a pattern of “publicly undermining judicial decisions and showing disregard for the rule of law and the separation of powers.”
“The firing of a career public servant, lawfully appointed by the court, is another blatant attempt to intimidate anyone that doesn’t agree with them and undermine judicial independence. This Administration may not like the law, but they are not above it,” they said.
Habba did not comment publicly on Tuesday’s developments, but Blanche blasted the judges for their “left-wing agenda.”
“When judges act like activists, they undermine confidence in our justice system. Alina is President Trump’s choice to lead — and no partisan bench can override that,” he wrote on social media.
Bumb, a Republican, was nominated to the bench in 2006 by President George W. Bush.
A White House spokesman said Tuesday afternoon that Trump remains committed to Habba.
“President Trump has full confidence in Alina Habba, whose work as acting U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey has made the Garden State and the nation safer,” spokesman Harrison Fields said. “The Trump Administration looks forward to her final confirmation in the U.S. Senate and will work tirelessly to ensure the people of New Jersey are well represented.”

The judge dismissed the lawsuit on procedural grounds. (Lori Kersey | West Virginia Watch)A Kanawha County judge has dismissed a legal action filed against the state Department of Health over its compliance with Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s executive order requiring it to issue religious exemptions to the state’s school-required vaccinations. 
Circuit Judge Kenneth Ballard dismissed the suit — filed by plaintiffs represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice — on procedural grounds without addressing the merits of the case. He agreed with an attorney representing the state that the ACLU had failed to meet a requirement that it notify the state 30 days in advance of filing the lawsuit. 
“I think I’m jurisdictionally barred,” Ballard said from the bench Wednesday. “I think that the petitioners here failed to satisfy the requirements of West Virginia Code 55-17-3 which requires either a …30-day notice or a pleading of injunctive relief.”
The judge said the ACLU’s complaint and arguments sought a writ of mandamus with little discussion of a request for injunctive relief. 
“I don’t think you appropriately sought this injunctive relief, I think you only interjected it at the end in an effort to get around this rule,” Ballard said.
The ACLU and Mountain State Justice filed the lawsuit May 23  against the state Department of Health on behalf of Marisa Jackson, of Kanawha County, and Dr. Joshua Hess, of Cabell County. Jackson and Hess are both parents of immunocompromised students. Hess is also a pediatric hematologist and oncologist practicing at Marshall Health’s Cabell Huntington Hospital. 
The petition asked the court to compel the state’s Department of Health and Bureau for Public Health to stop complying with the executive order requiring the state to allow religious exemptions for vaccine requirements. 
The state is one of only five in the country that has not allowed religious or philosophical exemptions to school required vaccines.
Despite Morrisey’s executive order, the state Legislature earlier this year voted down Senate Bill 460, which would have established those religious exemptions in state law. 
The state Board of Education voted recently to direct county boards of education not to allow religious exemptions. In a separate legal action, a Raleigh County parent whose child was issued a religious exemption by the Department of Health is suing the state and county school boards for not accepting the exemption. A hearing is scheduled for Thursday in the Raleigh County lawsuit. 
On behalf of the state, attorney Holly Wilson argued that the case can be dismissed for “myriad reasons,” including that the plaintiffs did not offer pre-suit notice or meet a burden to show standing.
“But if this court decides that it wants to reach the merits or that it should reach the merits, petitioners lose,” she said. “They can’t show a clear legal right. They can’t show a legal duty and certainly they can’t show a legal duty that’s non-discretionary.”
The state and Morrisey argue that the state’s vaccine laws taken together with a 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act require the state to allow religious exemptions. 
Aubrey Sparks, legal director for the ACLU, argued that the ACLU was not required to give the state 30 days notice because of an exception in the law when parties are asking for injunctive relief. 
Ballard dismissed the case without prejudice, meaning that the ACLU could re-file the lawsuit. 
Sparks told reporters after the hearing Wednesday it’s too soon to say whether the legal advocacy organization would do so. 
“It’s an open question about what our next steps are because I know that there’s a lot of other lawsuits pending on this issue,” Sparks said. “We want to understand what happens in those but we do feel fundamentally that what the state is doing here is unlawful. But then more concerningly, what the state has argued in this case is so profoundly unconstitutional that we all should be concerned.
“What they functionally came into this courtroom and said is that an act of the governor can just unilaterally swipe off the table any law that he thinks could burden someone’s religious exercise, and that’s just not supported and not permissible under our constitution.” 
In a post on the social media platform X Wednesday, Morrisey called the judge’s ruling the “first skirmish of a longer fight.”
“But the ultimate outcome — whether resolved via litigation or a change in statute — is not in doubt,” he said. “West Virginia is a radical outlier when it comes to onerous vaccine mandates — one of only 5 states in the nation with a statutorily-based, religious exemption.

Credit: Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesThe organization working to get a constitutional amendment on expanding Medicaid on the statewide ballot in 2026 released a public-opinion survey on Wednesday showing strong support for the proposal.
The survey of 800 likely Florida voters conducted by Global Strategy Group last month for Florida Decides Healthcare (FDH) shows that 67% support the proposal, and 25% oppose it. Constitutional amendments in the Sunshine State must receive 60% support to become law.
Florida is one of only 10 states that has not expanded Medicaid— the safety net program for the poor, elderly, and disabled — to childless, low-income, adults as allowed under the federal Affordable Care Act, often referred to as Obamacare.
“Floridians are ready for change. This polling confirms what we’ve known all along — voters want Medicaid expansion. Florida is at a breaking point. Without Medicaid expansion, we are heading straight into a healthcare catastrophe,” Mitch Emerson, executive director at Florida Decides Healthcare, said in a statement. “These aren’t just numbers. These are parents working two jobs who still can’t afford to see a doctor. These are veterans who served our country. These are seniors on the edge and caregivers holding their families together. We pay for Medicaid through our federal taxes, yet we’re the ones left behind. Medicaid expansion is the only path forward.”

The polling comes just weeks after the “one big beautiful bill” — President Donald Trump’s priority spending and tax legislation— became law. That measure cuts over a 10- year period upward of $1 trillion from Medicaid to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy. Congress still hasn’t extended the enhanced premium tax credits to help pay the costs of so-called Obamacare plans sold on the federal exchange. Those enhanced premiums are set to expire at the end of the year. Florida leads the nation in Obamacare enrollment.
The Florida Policy Institute estimates that the Medicaid cuts and the elimination of the enhanced premium tax credits for Obamacare policies will cause Florida’s uninsured rates to double to more than 19%.
While the proposed constitutional amendment has significant support, there’s no guarantee that it will appear on the 2026 statewide ballot.
FDH must get 881,000 signatures from across the state by next February to qualify for the 2026 ballot. FDH claims to have collected more than 150,000 signature petitions. The Florida Division of Elections, shows that 62,650 petitions have officially been received.
FDH and other groups have gone to federal court to try to block a new election law signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis that imposes significant restrictions on citizen-led constitutional amendments. Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Mark Walker stopped the state from enforcing the law’s ban against non-Florida residents and non-U.S. citizens from collecting petitions. However, he declined a request by FDH to block a 90-day moratorium on the verification of signatures.
It was the second ruling Walker issued in the challenge. In a June ruling, Walker refused to block most of the new requirements in the new law.
The proposed amendment would expand Medicaid expansion eligibility to adults aged 18 to 64 whose incomes fall at or below 138% of the federal poverty level. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says that there are 315,000 Floridians who earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid but too low to qualify for the tax credits that help lower the costs of the insurance policies on the exchange.
The survey of 800 Floridians was conducted by the Global Strategy Group between June 11-17, prior to the passage of Trump’s signature legislation. The poll has a margin of error of +/- 3.5%.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota will withdraw its Medicaid expansion work requirements proposal now that President Donald Trump has signed federal requirements into law, state Department of Social Services Secretary Matt Althoff told South Dakota Searchlight.
“We don’t have the choice,” Althoff said.
States have to apply for a federal waiver to impose their own requirements. The new law, passed earlier this month, “constricts any waivers” more lenient than the federal requirements, Althoff added.
States scramble to shield hospitals from GOP Medicaid cuts

The state’s proposal would have implemented fewer paperwork and tracking requirements than at the federal level, officials said during a public hearing process. Althoff called the waiver application a potential “exercise in futility” shortly after it became clear that federal requirements could be adopted.
The department proposed its work requirements this spring after South Dakota voters passed a constitutional amendment in November allowing the state to seek work requirements for the federal-state program. 
Medicaid is government-funded health insurance for people with low incomes. South Dakotans voted in 2022 to expand Medicaid to adults with incomes up to 138% of the poverty level, a decision that allowed the state to capitalize on a 90% federal funding match.
The federal work requirements will mandate that those between the ages of 19 and 65 who rely on the program work, volunteer or go to school 80 hours a month. Participants will have to meet those requirements a month before they enroll, and Medicaid renewal will be moved from an annual basis to every six months.
The federal government allows exceptions for people who are disabled, pregnant, eligible for the Indian Health Service, in foster care, were formerly in foster care and are younger than 26, or were released from incarceration in the last 90 days, among others.
South Dakota’s plan would not have set a number of hours to be eligible, but would have required Medicaid recipients to work, train, attend school, or serve as a caretaker for a child or elderly or disabled person in their home, unless they qualified for an exemption. Compliance with the state-level work rules would have been reviewed on an annual basis, at the time of Medicaid renewal, rather than at the time of application.
South Dakota Medicaid Director Heather Petermann said during the public hearing process that the state-proposed requirements were intended to “encourage” work without “trying to track arbitrary work hours.”
The federal work requirements must be implemented by the end of 2026.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/591A0333e-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-23 16:58:08.488842

The storms lasted three days between March 28-30, resulting in severe ice accumulation in northern Michigan with significant impacts to critical services throughout the region.
FEMA’s commitment to assisting Michigan came Wednesday, noting that federal funding would be available now to the state, tribal and eligible local governments, while certain nonprofit organizations would be eligible on a cost-sharing basis for repairs and replacement of qualifying facilities that were damaged in the storms.
Assistance will be provided to Alcona, Alpena, Antrim, Charlevoix, Cheboygan, Crawford, Emmet, Kalkaska, Mackinac, Montmorency, Oscoda, Otsego and Presque Isle counties.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
FEMA’s Darrin Ricketts has been named the federal coordinator for the operation in affected areas, the agency said in a news release.
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, in a statement, said she spoke with President Donald Trump on Tuesday, and he confirmed that communities in northern Michigan would start receiving FEMA funding soon.
“With this initial support, we can help communities recover costs associated with cleanup efforts,” Whitmer said. “I want to thank the president and our congressional delegation for supporting our request, and I look forward to collaborating further on much-needed additional resources. Michiganders across the state stepped up to help our neighbors, and while other parts of our request remain under review, we will continue advocating together to help Northern Michigan recover and rebuild.”

Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist added that many people and businesses are still recovering from the damage, and the federal declaration would help them get back on their feet.
“While this storm was devastating, Michiganders are strong, and we will stand tall together,” Gilchrist said in a statement.
Both U.S. Rep. Jack Bergman (R-Watersmeet) and U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Township) said the money would help in a big way.
“The state of Michigan and local emergency managers continue to work hard because this job is not finished, and I’ll keep fighting to help our communities get the resources they need to bounce back stronger,” Peters said in a statement.
Bergman thanked Trump and his administration for the support.
“This long-awaited decision unlocks critical resources to help our communities recover and rebuild as quickly as possible,” Bergman said in a statement. “It’s been a true team effort – from local agencies to state and federal partners. Northern Michigan is no stranger to tough times – but it’s in moments like these, when our communities rally and move forward together, that the true spirit of Northern Michigan shines brightest.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GnSfcm9WoAAA20G-768x1024.jpg,,,2025-07-23 16:58:08.488842

In a statement that closely echoes an internal memo hospital leadership sent to employees a few days ago, CCMC referred obliquely to pressure from the Trump administration and indicated the hospital struggled with the decision. 
“In recent months, we have been carefully reviewing the long-term sustainability of our gender care program in light of an increasingly complex and evolving landscape. After thoughtful consideration and guidance from medical and legal experts, we have made the difficult decision to begin winding down this program for patients under the age of 19. This process is being carried out in a deliberate and planful way, with ongoing communication and support for the families and team members directly involved. It continues to be an evolving and fluid situation,” the statement reads, which was attributed to President and CEO Jim Shmerling.
“We are approaching each situation on a case-by-case basis to ensure that every child’s needs are considered with compassion, clinical judgment, and care. We remain fully committed to providing inclusive, respectful care to all children and to ensuring that every family continues to feel safe, supported, and heard at Connecticut Children’s.”
CCMC declined to comment further, saying it “will continue to share information with our stakeholders as appropriate.”
Gov. Ned Lamont’s office, which said it had been briefed on the decision, issued a statement attributed to the governor Wednesday afternoon.
“It’s disappointing for hospitals in Connecticut to be forced to make the difficult decision to end gender-affirming care for minors in response to the federal executive order. These decisions are not based on Connecticut values or Connecticut law—they part of a series of relentless federal demands that have created fear, confusion, and legal uncertainty for our healthcare providers,” Lamont said. 
“To transgender youth and their families in Connecticut: you are not alone. We see you, we support you, and we are working closely with the Attorney General and hospital leaders to understand the full impact,” the statement continued. “In Connecticut, we do not turn our backs on kids in need.”
In an internal communication sent several days ago, the hospital described the change to gender-affirming care as “one of the most difficult decisions our leadership team has had to make.”
The internal communication also cited the current “government landscape and pressure surrounding this care” and confirmed that the hospital had taken into consideration guidance from both legal and clinical teams and had decided to take “voluntary steps to protect our patients, our staff and the long-term strength of our organization.”
The closure brings to life the changes that many health care providers are considering under the current federal administration.
During an interview with CT Mirror in February, Shmerling said the political backlash against gender-affirming care is unlike anything he has seen in his 45-year career managing children’s hospitals. 
“There’s a tremendous amount of misinformation and lack of understanding and emotion around this issue,” Shmerling said.
The gender-related treatment options historically provided at Connecticut Children’s followed guidelines from major medical associations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Pediatric Endocrine Society and the Society of Pediatric Psychology. 
The hospital did not provide medication or hormonal treatments for children who are prepubescent, nor did it perform any surgeries. Shmerling added that families are always involved, and care is only provided with parental consent.
Since President Donald J. Trump took office, his administration has targeted gender-affirming care for children. 
In January, Trump signed an executive order aimed at withholding federal funding from institutions, including medical schools and hospitals, that provide gender-affirming care to kids. The directive also sought to restrict coverage of those services from federally-run insurance programs, like Medicaid. A federal judge temporarily blocked the order the following month.
Earlier this month, the Department of Justice issued more than 20 subpoenas to providers of youth gender-affirming care in connection with investigations related to “healthcare fraud, false statements, and more.”
Gender-affirming care for children can involve counseling, hormone therapy and puberty blockers. Current medical protocols do not recommend medication or hormones for children who haven’t yet gone through puberty, according to the Yale School of Medicine, but those patients can receive counseling.
Surgery is rarely used as treatment for transgender and gender-diverse children in the U.S., a 2024 Harvard study found. A study published in 2023 found that, out of a total 48,000 gender-affirming surgeries performed in the U.S. between 2016 and 2020, 7.7% were performed on children between the ages of 12 and 18. The vast majority of the procedures performed on children were breast and chest surgeries.
Yale Medicine also runs a pediatric gender care program.

Many residents are familiar with recycling and composting — but one Vermont initiative focuses on making it easier to reuse.

COVENTRY — Vermont’s single landfill in Coventry receives hundreds of thousands of pounds of waste every year. Most of that amount is municipal waste — regular household and business trash like a Snicker’s wrapper or an old rocking chair.
In 2023 alone, a report by the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation showed Vermonters generated 540,000 tons of municipal solid waste. That’s equivalent to the weight of 1.5 Empire State Buildings.
Vermont’s solid waste plan has a goal to prevent 50% of the state’s waste stream from entering the landfill by reducing, recycling, repairing and composting. The closest the state came to meeting that number was in 2024, when 41% was diverted, according to Josh Kelly, solid waste program manager of the Waste Management and Prevention Division at DEC. 
In order to reach state goals, and connect Vermonters across the state, DEC created a new initiative called ReVT to be administered by Anne Bijur of the Solid Waste Division. 
The goals of the initiative are twofold, said Bijur, who supervises the materials management section of the division. 
“The first is to build this coalition around waste reduction, reuse and repair,” Bijur said. “The second is to create an open, inclusive network that supports practitioners and all Vermonters to participate.”
ReVT held its inaugural board meeting on May 13 over Microsoft Teams. The meeting was open to anyone interested in reuse and repair opportunities.
Forty-five participants logged on to learn from the program’s advisory committee and community presenters, according to its first newsletter. At the end, they were given the opportunity to engage in a 20-minute breakout group session to provide their feedback. 
Presenters at the meeting included a Front Porch Forum representative, the owner of a secondhand craft store in Burlington and an organizer of repair cafes in Addison County.
Susan Alexander, the program coordinator of ReVT, recognized the broad community that the initiative involved. It was this diversity, she said in the meeting, that would make ReVT a success.
“There’s a lot of different angles to this,” Alexander said in a later phone call. “There’s the people who are trying to make a living doing it. There’s the folks who are trying to preserve our planet and conserve resources. There’s people who love fixing things. There are people who love going to thrift shops.” 
Through ReVT, Alexander hopes to amplify opportunities for reducing, reusing and repairing, cutting down on the amount of waste going to the Coventry landfill. These processes also conserve the natural resources used to make these products, Alexander said.
The program can also support a circular economy, Alexander said, where goods are recycled indefinitely, moving through many hands rather than ending up in the trash after the first use. 
“Instead of buying something at the store, then it breaks and goes to the landfill,” Alexander said, “(ReVT) is going to keep things looping through their life cycle as many times as possible.” 
The project is funded through a Solid Waste Infrastructure for Recycling grant provided by the Environmental Protection Agency in 2023. Of that grant, almost $17,000 was allocated to ReVT’s initiatives. Though the money is guaranteed now, it is unclear whether further funding will be provided after the conclusion of the contract in August 2026, Kelly said.
Regardless of funds, Kelly, Bijur and Alexander hope that ReVT will become a movement with a lasting impact. Their ultimate goal is to build support toward a coalition similar to the Composting Association of Vermont, which hosts a conference every spring. 
“Often there’s local solutions that can contribute to an economy,” Kelly said. “I just think people need that awareness to think about reuse repair first — not only for reducing waste, but for the people that it sustains.” 
Arianna Soloway, who presented at the ReVT meeting, is one of those people. She started a secondhand art store and community art space last November. Her store, The Makery, is located on 388 Pine St. in Burlington. 
“I’ve done a million different crafts over time and accumulated a lot of stuff for all of those different crafts,” Soloway said. “As I’ve gotten older … the more I find myself not being creative because I get hung up on the environmental issues of it.”
Soloway said that she was inspired to start The Makery from her job as the manager of Muscle Up Yarn in Shelburne, where customers would come in asking for places to distribute unused materials from late family members. Others would come in looking for more affordable crafting supplies.
After doing some research, Soloway was surprised to find that Burlington didn’t have a secondhand art store — and decided that she could change that.
“There was a point in my head I think where it went from, ‘I wish somebody else would do that,’ to, ‘What if somebody else does that before I do?’” Soloway said. 
The Makery also provides ways for longtime artisans and prospective artists alike to bond over low-pressure crafter gatherings. “It’s so hard as an adult to try something new and to feel like, “Is this worth it?’” Soloway said. That’s why her “Craft and Sip” nights were born, along with other workshops.
Looking forward, ReVT plans to host more community meetings to provide space for discussion and feedback. They’re also committed to increasing the prominence of events like repair cafes and the visibility of local handypersons through statewide directories.
“We want (ReVT) to be driven by the community,” Alexander said. “We don’t want to tell them, ‘This is what we’re going to show you.’ We want people in that reuse and repair community to come to us and say, ‘Hey, we’d like to learn about this.’”
ReVT’s listserv currently reaches about 150 people. Members have access to the program’s newsletter, which highlights reuse and repair businesses, recaps previous meetings and provides space for individuals to voice their thoughts. 
“I think more than anything, I’m just glad to be a part of the solution,” Soloway said.

Free.,"US-Japan trade deal sets 15% tax on imported vehicles, $550B investment in US",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-japan-trade-deal-sets-15-tax-imported-vehicles-550b-investment-us,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said late Tuesday he struck a “massive” trade deal with Japan, lowering his threatened tariffs on Japanese products.The deal, according to Japanese negotiators, will include a lower rate on the country’s top export: automobiles.Trump’s declaration of a new framework comes as a legal fight over a large portion of his tariff policy will be heard in federal appeals court next week.The president announced via Truth Social Tuesday evening that Japan had agreed “at my direction” to invest $550 billion in the United States and will open its markets to more American products, including cars, trucks, rice and other agricultural goods.In exchange, Trump agreed to lower what he calls “reciprocal” import taxes on Japanese products to 15%, down from the 25% rate he threatened in early July.Tariffs are import taxes paid by U.S. companies and individuals who purchase goods from other countries.While some details remained unclear, Trump said the agreement is “the largest Deal ever made,” and continued in a post on his online platform that “there has never been anything like it.”Japan’s government confirmed the new deal Wednesday. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said the parties agreed to a 15% tariff on Japanese vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. without any volume restrictions — down from the blanket 25% U.S. tariff on foreign cars that went into effect in April. Hayashi delivered the remarks through an English translation during a morning press conference.Jeff Schott, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said securing $550 billion in investment from Japan would set the agreement apart from other trade deals.“There isn't a lot of information about over what period of time this would cover, and how it would be financed, and things like that, but the headline number of $550 billion is certainly notable, if it’s believable and if it’s achievable,” Schott said Wednesday in an interview with States Newsroom.While specifics are unknown, possible investments from Japan might include Nippon Steel’s takeover of U.S. Steel, or a joint venture to export liquified natural gas from Alaska.Schott said the trade deal “is likely going to set a template” for trade talks with other nations, including ongoing negotiations this week in Washington, D.C., with South Korean officials.Aug. 1 deadline setThe news of a deal with Japan came just after the White House announced new trade arrangements with Indonesia and the Philippines ahead of a self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline, when steeper tariffs are set to trigger on trading partners around the world.Trump had threatened Japan in a letter earlier this month with a 25% ""reciprocal"" tariff on all Japanese goods set to begin Aug. 1, in addition to special sectoral and national security tariffs on foreign automobiles, at 25%, and imported steel and aluminum, which now sit at 50%.The president shocked global markets in early April when he announced a universal 10% tariff on every foreign good coming into the U.S., plus staggering additional “reciprocal” import taxes on major trading partners based on the country’s trading relationship with the U.S.Trump initially slapped a 24% reciprocal tariff on Japan, which imports less from the U.S. than U.S. entities buy from Japan. The U.S. ran a $69.4 billion trade deficit with Japan in 2024, according to the Census Bureau.Trump has twice delayed his so-called reciprocal tariffs on other economies as his administration attempts to leverage the threats into agreements. The administration has yet to strike a new deal with the European Union, another major trading partner.Court hearingThe U.S. Appeals Court for the Federal Circuit is set to hear oral arguments July 31 over Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, which he triggered by declaring international trade a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.The U.S. Court of International Trade struck down Trump’s emergency tariffs as unconstitutional in a May 28 decision, following two legal challenges brought by a handful of business owners and a dozen Democratic state attorneys general.Arizona, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon were among the states that brought the suit.V.O.S. Selections, a New York-based company that imports wine and spirits from 16 countries, led the business plaintiffs. Others included a Utah-based plastics producer, a Virginia-based children’s electricity learning kit maker, a Pennsylvania-based fishing gear company and a Vermont-based women’s cycling apparel company.Upon appeal from the White House, the Federal Circuit allowed Trump’s tariffs to remain in place while the case moved forward.",,,,2025-07-23 15:57:03.268432

(Photo courtesy of the Auditor of State's Office)The state auditor’s office has released a new report detailing almost two dozen deficiencies in Iowa Workforce Development’s policies and practices.
The report faults IWD for failing to comply with its own policies and procedures to ensure the timely filing of reports; failing to properly review and approve quarterly reports; and failing to properly check the accuracy of information generated for financial reporting.
Auditor of State Rob Sand has recommended the department revise its policies and procedures to better identify ineligible claims for payment and to ensure background investigations are routinely performed as part of the hiring process.

Sand is also recommending the department ensure that financial reconciliations are independently reviewed and that the agency either comply with current state law or seek to have outdated laws repealed.
The report notes that 19 of the 22 deficiencies are issues cited in previous years’ audits.
IWD officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report, but the state agency’s written responses to individual findings indicate that IWD attributes many of the cited deficiencies to staff turnover within the department.
Among the issues cited by the state auditor:
Detection of fraud: Earlier this year, Jodi Spargur-Tate, a former program director at Children and Families of Iowa, was alleged to have improperly spent $427,000 in taxpayer money that originated with a U.S. Department of Labor job training grant that passed through IWD.  Court records indicate Spargur-Tate has not been criminally charged in the case. According to the auditor’s office, it has repeatedly pointed out that since 2015, IWD has failed to oversee subrecipients of grant money such as CFI. In response to the new report raising the issue, IWD suggested CFI and others were also to blame, noting that “effective oversight requires reciprocal diligence by all stakeholders” and “at all levels.”
Internal oversight of federal funding: IWD is required to maintain effective internal controls over the award of federal money to ensure it is spent according to federal requirements. Part of the process involves the creation of financial reports, although auditors found that the total expenditures in those reports did not always agree with the state’s own accounting system. In total, the IWD reports “overstated $503,067,” the auditor found, adding that due to staff turnover IWD didn’t have adequate resources to ensure the reconciliation of financial records or ensure the records were properly reviewed and filed on a timely basis.
Cash management: Generally, a maximum of three days is considered acceptable between the receipt of federal funds and IWD’s disbursement of those funds. The auditor’s review of IWD records identified “excessive” cash balances in the millions of dollars. The auditor found that although procedures had been established to draw federal funds only in amounts sufficient to cover current needs, IWD did not review or update its procedures to account for federal draws associated with pandemic-related administrative programs and unemployment benefits.
Federal and state cost sharing: Some state expenses related to IWD work are funded through the federal government. IWD has a process for separately allocating certain costs to either federal or state programs based on a combination of the square footage and time devoted to the separate programs. Although IWD policies require certain elements of that cost-allocation process to be reviewed and updated quarterly, that work wasn’t always performed in 2024, affecting $892,043 in cost allocations, the auditor found. In response, IWD said that going forward, the quarterly review updates will instead be done annually unless there are significant changes that necessitate quarterly reviews.
Worker compensation: IWD failed to properly report “short time compensation” — payments to workers whose hours had been reduced to avoid layoffs — and other payouts throughout the fiscal year. “General ledgers were not maintained properly throughout fiscal year 2024,” the auditor found, and one account balance was overstated by $5.2 million while another was overstated by $5.1 million. The situation resulted in “undetected reporting errors and misstatements,” and increased the risk for further undetected reporting errors, the auditor concluded.
Accuracy of benefits: A program designed to determine the accuracy of paid and denied unemployment benefits calls for IWD to complete a financial review within 120 days of the end of a fiscal year. IWD management “decided to close cases if they were over 150 days old so that the Quality Control Department could focus on current cases,” the auditor found. However, Iowa Workforce Development did not have written instruction from the U.S. Department of Labor to close the cases and it was denied that relief by the DOL when it was requested, the auditor added. In its written response to that finding, IWD explained that after the pandemic the department had a complete turnover in benefit-accuracy management staff.

In a unanimous opinion written by Justice Brian Zahra, the high court in Davis v. BetMGM ruled that the Michigan Legislature did not intend for the Lawful Internet Gambling Act to prevent litigants from bringing common-law claims related to gambling disputes between a patron and a gambling licensee.
That means two lower court decisions from the Michigan Court of Appeals and the Wayne County Circuit Court were overturned, and the lower court has jurisdiction to hear the case as it moves forward. 
The case dealt with a large winnings pot earned by a BetMGM patron, Jacqueline Davis, which the player withdrew in the amount of $100,000. When that happened, BetMGM suspended her account and blocked her from accessing the remaining sum, which was around $3.2 million.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Investigators for BetMGM determined that the player’s money was erroneously credited and closed the account. Davis sued on fraud and breach of contract grounds, but the Wayne Circuit Court ruled that it lacked the subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case. The judge noted that was because the Lawful Internet Gambling Act preempted the claims.
A complaint was filed to the Michigan Gaming Control Board while the appeal was pending, but the Michigan Court of Appeals in a published 2-1 decision affirmed the lower court.
The high court was asked to determine whether the court or the board had jurisdiction.
Zahra wrote that it did, because aside from the legislative intent factor, common-law claims, like breach of contract complaint, were not so inconsistent with the Lawful Internet Gambling Act that they could be preempted by the law.
“Simply because the Michigan Gaming Control Board may take corrective measures on some matters under the [act] does not mean that the [board] is required to take corrective measures on all matters to resolve a dispute between a patron and licensee,” Zahra added. “Further, that the [board] may act does not indicate that a complaint filed with the [board] constitutes the exclusive remedy for an aggrieved consumer of online gambling activity.”
Justice Noah Hood did not participate because the case was heard for oral arguments before he was appointed to the bench this year.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_8824-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-23 15:57:03.268432

(Kathleen Flynn/Special to ProPublica)Louisiana passed a new police accountability law following allegations of civil rights violations against a sheriff’s deputy caught on video dragging a Black woman by her hair and slamming her head into the ground.
The woman, Shantel Arnold, sued the deputy and the sheriff, accusing the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office of conspiring to cover up the 2021 assault. The Sheriff’s Office agreed in March to pay Arnold $300,000 after three days of trial but before jury deliberations began, Arnold’s attorney said.

This article was produced for ProPublica’s Local Reporting Network in partnership with Verite News. Sign up for Dispatches to get stories like this one as soon as they are published.

After the incident, ProPublica, in partnership with WRKF, WWNO and The Times-Picayune, published an investigation detailing the long history of excessive-force complaints against Jefferson Parish sheriff’s Deputy Julio Alvarado. Alvarado, a 20-year veteran of the Sheriff’s Office, was employed by the department as of March.
Arnold’s attorney, state Sen. Gary Carter, D-New Orleans, said he introduced the legislation after it emerged that Alvarado had failed to write a report about his encounter with Arnold despite his department’s policy that officers document each time they use force. Jefferson Parish Sheriff Joseph Lopinto said during his testimony in the March trial over Arnold’s lawsuit that Alvarado’s commanders instructed him against writing such a report after video of his actions spread across social media.
Arnold’s run-in with Alvarado, which was captured in a 14-second video, left the woman with bruises and scratches across her body, a busted lip and recurring headaches, according to her subsequent account to police investigators.
“Had it not been for a bystander capturing how this officer beat up Shantel Arnold, there would be no report, there would be no evidence of it, there would be no indication that it ever happened,” Carter said in a recent interview.
The new law, passed unanimously by state legislators and signed by Gov. Jeff Landry in June, will require all law enforcement agencies to report every time an officer’s use of force results in serious injury. It directs the Council on Peace Officer Standards and Training, which certifies police officers, to adopt a policy on mandatory use-of-force reporting by Jan. 1. Details of how the process will work have not been spelled out, nor has the penalty for failing to comply.
The bill was introduced as “Shantel Arnold’s Law,” but Carter said that name was removed because “Sheriff Lopinto got very upset about that, and that almost killed the bill.”
Neither the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office nor Alvarado’s attorney responded to requests for comment or an interview.
Alvarado came across Arnold in September 2021, when the officer responded to a 911 call about a fight among 25 people in Jefferson Parish. When the deputy pulled up in his patrol car, Alvarado saw Arnold, covered in dirt, walking down the street. Arnold told the deputy she was attacked by a group of boys who frequently bullied her. When Alvarado ordered her to stop, Arnold said she just wanted to go home and kept walking. That’s when the deputy jumped out of his vehicle, grabbed Arnold and slammed her into the sidewalk, according to several witnesses.

In a video taken by a bystander, Alvarado drags Arnold along the pavement, holds her by her braids and slams her repeatedly onto the pavement. Arnold was not charged with a crime and was later taken to a hospital. The Sheriff’s Office did not use body cameras at the time but has since begun using them.
The Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office denied wrongdoing. A 2022 internal investigation by the Sheriff’s Office determined Alvarado’s actions against Arnold were “both reasonable and acceptable.” Alvarado received an “approximately” 40-hour suspension for failing to file a written report, Lopinto said in his March testimony.
Arnold alleged in her 2022 lawsuit that the Sheriff’s Office knew Alvarado had a propensity for violence against Black people and other minority groups yet continued to have him patrol such communities, putting the public in danger.
Lopinto attributed Alvarado’s history of complaints to his working a high-crime beat, according to a 2022 Times-Picayune interview. “It’s not like he’s getting a complaint every month,” Lopinto said. During that same interview, Lopinto dismissed Arnold’s account and accused her of “looking for a paycheck.”
Alvarado’s alleged misdeeds fit a broader pattern in the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office, as the yearlong investigation into the Sheriff’s Office by ProPublica, WRKF and WWNO found. Between 2013 and 2021, deputies disproportionately discharged guns against Black people. Of the 40 people shot at by Jefferson Parish deputies during that time, 73% were Black, more than double their share of the population. Twelve of the 16 people who died after being shot or restrained by deputies during that time were Black.
Alvarado has been named in at least 10 federal civil rights lawsuits since 2007, all involving the use of excessive force; eight of the plaintiffs were members of minority groups.
The Sheriff’s Office settled three of those lawsuits. Arnold’s $300,000 payout is the third — and largest — settlement involving Alvarado. Five other lawsuits were closed in favor of the Sheriff’s Office, one was dismissed on a legal technicality and one was indefinitely delayed.
The Sheriff’s Office said in filings responding to the eight lawsuits that were not dismissed or delayed that officers’ actions were “reasonable under the circumstances” and characterized the claims as “frivolous.”

Prior to the 2021 incident involving Arnold, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office had settled a 2016 lawsuit accusing Alvarado of grabbing a 14-year-old Hispanic boy by the neck and slamming his head against the concrete as the child screamed, “Why are you doing this to me?” A woman had called the police complaining that the boy and a friend were wrestling in a parking lot. Alvarado then threatened to have the boy and his family deported, according to the suit. The Sheriff’s Office, which paid the boy’s family $15,000, said in court filings that Alvarado’s actions were “reasonable under the circumstances.”
In 2018, another lawsuit claimed Alvarado and three deputies beat Atdner Casco, a Honduran native, and stole more than $2,000 from him during a traffic stop the year before, then conspired to have him deported. Casco claimed Alvarado beat and choked him until he agreed to keep silent about being robbed. The Sheriff’s Office denied wrongdoing but settled that case in 2020 for $50,000.
Both incidents were cited in Arnold’s lawsuit as evidence that Alvarado has exhibited a pattern of behavior throughout his career that made him unfit for duty. Carter, Arnold’s attorney, raised yet another incident during the March trial in which sheriff detectives in December 2019 witnessed Alvarado patronizing a massage parlor that was being investigated for suspected prostitution. Alvarado denied he went there to “have a sexual act performed on him.” He was demoted from sergeant to deputy for “bringing the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office in disrepute” and for patronizing an “illegitimate business while on duty and neglecting your responsibilities to detectives under your command,” Carter said during the trial, citing an internal police report.
Carter said in an interview that Lopinto’s continued defense and employment of Alvarado represented a permissive attitude toward questionable behavior.
“He stood by” Alvarado, who “shows no contrition, no remorse,” Carter said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-23 19:25:02+00:00,CT Mirror,EPA closes Long Island Sound office in Stamford,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/23/epa-closes-long-island-sound-office-stamford-ct/,The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has closed its Long Island Sound office in Stamford as a result of federal cost-cutting measures.,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has closed its Long Island Sound office in Stamford amid a wave of government cost-cutting, officials confirmed this week.
The office had been located in the Stamford Government Center, with the city acting as the landlord, according to Lauren Meyer, a special assistant to Mayor Caroline Simmons. Earlier this year it was one of hundreds of federal leases marked for termination by the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, according to a list published online.
While the office was first included on DOGE’s closure list in February, Meyer said that agency did not terminate its lease with the city until late last month.
In a statement Wednesday, a spokesperson for the EPA confirmed that agency closed the office, effective June 30, after moving its remaining staff to the EPA’s main regional office in New York City. 
“The structural reorganization will save taxpayers the cost of leasing the office, while still allowing the important work to protect and enhance the Long Island Sound to continue,” the statement said. “No staff were terminated or given different assignments.”
Meyer said the EPA was in the first year of a five-year lease for its office space at the Stamford Government Center, with a monthly rent of $5,803. The termination of the lease was expected to save taxpayers $308,951, according to DOGE. 
Among the duties of the office was overseeing the Long Island Sound Partnership, a collaboration between the federal government and the states of New York and Connecticut to improve water quality and monitor the overall health of the Sound. The partnership was established by Congress in 1985, and has been credited with helping to reduce nitrogen pollution by half in the Sound, along with the restoration of over 2,400 acres of wetlands.
The longtime director of the office, Mark Tedesco, announced his retirement late last year after more than three decades spent with the EPA.

Tedesco was one of three employees who worked out of the Stamford office, according to the EPA. Of the two remaining staffers, one moved to the agency’s New York office and the other opted to accept the deferred resignation offer sent out by the Trump administration earlier this year.
Altogether, the EPA has seven staff members assigned to the Long Island Sound Partnership, split between the agency’s offices in New York and Boston. 
“EPA continues to fully support the Long Island Sound Partnership program, and we are not making changes to the program,” the agency said in its statement Wednesday. 
Denise Stranko, the executive vice president of programs at the Connecticut-based nonprofit Save the Sound, declined to comment directly on the office’s closure on Wednesday. Instead, she said the group is focused on maintaining current funding for the EPA’s Long Island Sound program in the next federal budget, as well as finding Tedesco’s successor.
In June, the EPA named Nicole Tachiki, a former staffer under Tedesco, to serve as active director of the Long Island Sound Partnership. Due to an ongoing federal hiring freeze, Stranko said that the EPA will need to obtain a waiver before appointing someone to fill the role permanently.
“We have been very supportive of the request for a waiver so that that position can permanently be filled,” Stranko said. “That’s really big for us, and we are looking to EPA to do that.”
But Tom Anderson, the author of a book on the Sound titled “This Fine Piece of Water” — with a forward by former activist and current Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — said that the move could make it more difficult for the staff at the EPA to continue their work.
“If you’re overseeing Long Island Sound, you ought to be on Long Island Sound, not on the southern end of Manhattan,” Anderson said. 
President Donald Trump’s EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, is a former Republican congressman from Long Island who served as co-chair of the House’s Long Island Sound Caucus. 
Earlier this year, to mark the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Long Island Sound Partnership, Zeldin announced the the program’s latest Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan. The plan called for increased water monitoring, removal of marine debris, restoration of coastal habitats and increased public access to the Sound, among other goals.
“Forty years of dedication, hard work and passion have now defended this critical waterway,” Zeldin said in a video promoting the plan. “We look forward to doing our part at the EPA to advance this cause for decades to come.”
A spokesman for U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, D-4th District, said that the congressman’s office was not notified by the EPA of its decision to close the office within his district.
Another member of the Connecticut delegation, U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, serves as co-chair of the Long Island Sound Caucus and released a statement Wednesday raising concerns about the move, which he noted follows the announcement of plans by the EPA to shrink its workforce by 23% and close its research arm.
“I am closely monitoring any impact of EPA office closures in our state along with local stakeholders,” Courtney said. “The Long Island Sound is an ecological treasure that requires constant, vigilant care… I am committed to ensuring that recent progress that the EPA has contributed to continues uninterrupted.”
Trump’s budget request for the upcoming fiscal year includes $40 million for the EPA’s Long Island Sound program, keeping it level at current funding. At the same time, the budget proposes slashing funding for similar geographic programs in the San Francisco Bay and Washington’s Puget Sound.
Since taking over the EPA in January, Zeldin has sought to roll back many existing federal environmental regulations, and instead focus the agency’s efforts on lowering costs, providing a boost to industry and helping to “unleash American energy.” On Tuesday, The New York Times reported that the EPA was planning on rescinding a key finding that had allowed the agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/EPA-CLOSE-0723-DE-031-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-23 15:57:03.268432

(Baylor Spears | Wisconsin Examiner)A handful of Republican lawmakers are seeking, again, to take away schools’ authority to raise their school revenue limits by $325 per pupil annually for the next four centuries, given to them through a partial veto by Gov. Tony Evers. 
Reps. Dave Maxey (R-New Berlin) and Jim Piwowarczyk (R-Hubertus) alongside Sens. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield) and Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) said in a memo that the bill would put “property tax decisions back into the hands of local voters and taxpayers where they belong.” 
“The pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock 402 years before this veto,” the lawmakers said. “It is hard to justify locking in a funding increase for just as long into the future.” 
In the 2023-25 state budget bill, lawmakers included a $325 increase to schools’ revenue limits for only two years, 2023-24 and 2024-25. When the bill made it to Evers, he exercised his partial veto power, striking two digits and a dash from the years to extend the annual increases through 2425 — an additional 400 years. 
In the last state budget, the Legislature allocated money to school general aid to support the revenue limit increase. The new state budget approved earlier this month did not include any general aid increase meaning that if school districts decide to use the $325 per pupil revenue increase, it will come solely from property taxes. The increase is not automatic and would need to be approved by individual school boards.
The partial veto was controversial at the time with Republican lawmakers complaining that property taxpayers would be burdened by the veto and Evers had broken the deal with lawmakers. Evers defended it, saying he was giving schools a reliable annual funding increase. Republicans sued, attempting to get the veto declared unconstitutional, but the state Supreme Court upheld it in April, saying it was within Evers’ constitutional powers.
Evers celebrated that decision, saying at the time that schools deserve “sustainable, dependable, and spendable state support and investment.” 
“For over a decade, the Legislature has failed to meet that important obligation,” Evers said in April. “Importantly, this decision does not mean our work is done — far from it.” 
The bill faces a difficult path to becoming law as it would need to pass the Assembly and Senate and not be vetoed by Evers.
The bill authors also complained about the governor’s vast veto power, which is one of the broadest in the nation. 
“This use of that power has gone way too far,” the lawmakers said. They referenced the dissent from Justice Brian Hagedorn in the lawsuit, saying that the veto gives the governor “monarchical” powers.
The power has been curtailed in the past through state Supreme Court rulings, including recently when the Court unanimously ruled in another case that one of Evers’ partial vetoes was unconstitutional. Wisconsin governors have also lost some of their considerable partial veto authority through constitutional amendments. 
Evers’ 400-year veto led Republican lawmakers to introduce constitutional amendment proposals that would limit the power further. A constitutional amendment would need to pass the Senate and Assembly twice in consecutive legislative sessions and get approval from voters before it would become law.

The study was conducted by Citizens Action Coalition and “exposes how Indiana’s monopoly utilities have imposed the most severe electric bill increases on residential customers in at least two decades — with some families paying nearly $50 more a month than just one year ago.”
Using data from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC), the utility-focused customer advocacy group compared July 1 residential bills for 1,000 kWh of usage from 2024 and 2025.
“Things keeps getting worse for Hoosier consumers and our state leaders continue to allow it to happen,” said Kerwin Olson, executive director of the coalition. “Based on this trend, the rhetoric regarding affordability emanating from the Statehouse appears to be nothing more than lip service. Hoosier consumers can no longer afford monopoly pricing. Something must change, soon”
The statewide average increase was nearly double the prior year’s record increase of 9.3%, the analysis found.
“Indiana has been growing, and Indiana’s utilities have an obligation to keep pace with that demand and power a modern economy,” the Indiana Energy Association said in a statement.

“In recent years, our energy companies have made substantial investments in additional power generation and modernization of the state’s century-old electric grid that delivers that power. We’ve added advanced technology to the electric grid that reduces power outages and hardens the grid against severe weather. There also have been substantial investments in evolving environmental regulations. We are committed to keeping affordability top of mind, while also making the investments needed to provide reliable electricity.”

IEA is a trade association that represents Indiana’s investor-owned electric utilities and local distribution gas companies.
Here are some findings about individual utilities from the analysis:

NIPSCO residential customers were hit hardest: $50 per month (26.7%) increase in just one year, compounding a 17.8% hike in 2024. This follows an IURC-approved settlement opposed by CAC.
CenterPoint bills surged $44 per month (25%) after the IURC greenlit a large base rate increase.
Duke Energy Indiana raised residential bills nearly $26 per month (20%).
AES Indiana increased bills nearly $17 per month (12%) — and now seeks an additional $21 per month by 2027 in a pending rate case.
I&M bills rose $6 per month (3.9%).

IEA noted the U.S. Energy Information Administration ranks ranks Indiana residential prices among the lowest in the east north central region.

Cooper is “preparing to launch his Senate campaign next week,” Axios reported Wednesday, citing multiple sources. Punchbowl News also reported Cooper’s plan.
The two-term governor who left office in January would immediately become the favorite for the Democratic nomination. He would seek to flip a seat currently held by Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, who announced last month he would not seek re-election.
Morgan Jackson, a longtime political advisor to Cooper, would not confirm the reports but said the former governor “would be making his intentions known in the coming days.” Cooper is set to speak to North Carolina Democrats at the party’s annual fundraising dinner this weekend.
Former U.S. Rep. Wiley Nickel, a Democrat, has already announced a campaign for the seat.
Across the aisle, the Republican field remains unclear. Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law, is reportedly Republicans’ top preference to run for the seat. In a radio interview Wednesday morning, Trump said she was a “big, fat maybe” on whether she would enter the race, and said she was still discussing it with her husband.
Other potential Republican candidates, including several members of North Carolina’s U.S. House delegation, are awaiting Trump’s decision.

(Getty Images)Earlier this week, the Bulletin published a conversation between States Newsroom’s Elisha Brown and economist Darrick Hamilton about the Trump administration’s new investment accounts for children.
Within that discussion, Hamilton said this about the accounts: “What they’re investing is trivial compared to the ways in which they’re structuring inequality writ large with the tax code for the wealthy. This is a rhetorical distraction that’s aimed at trying to appear populist, especially when they’re cutting Medicaid, SNAP, and other investments that go toward low-income individuals. So that’s thing one. We’d be naive to ignore the political context in which this comes up.”
The accounts are indeed designed to benefit wealthier families, and it’s worth your time to read up on the program. But Hamilton’s larger point — that so-called populist initiatives must be considered within the wider Republican policy push — is instructive not only for understanding the national GOP’s overall strategy but this New Hampshire policy moment as well.
And it all starts with the American “bootstrap” mythology so exalted by conservatives. The spoonful of sugar that makes that medicine go down is the falsehood that the only worthy success in this nation is achieved purely through individual effort, or “pulling oneself up by the bootstraps.” Conveniently absent from the myth — but very well understood by the American president and all who purchase access to him — is just how little bootstraps matter compared to inherited wealth.
Writing in Fortune this week, Nick Lichtenberg reports that “America stands at the edge of the most dramatic shift in personal finance ever measured — a generational transfer of nearly $124 trillion in assets over just 25 years.” About $105 trillion of that will go to heirs who have no clue what bootstraps even are.
Now, consider how the current political climate affects the other end of the wealth ladder.  
In New Hampshire, a state of 1.4 million people, 186,000 children and adults are enrolled in Medicaid, according to KFF. That’s about 1 in 7 Granite Staters covered by a federal-state health insurance program that exists to keep the poorest among us — our neighbors, friends, and family — healthy and alive.
But this past legislative session, New Hampshire Republicans included several Medicaid changes that add to the financial burden of those 1 in 7: new monthly premiums (ranging from $60 for an individual to $100 for a family of four at 100% of the federal poverty level of $32,150); a waiver to institute work requirements; and a waiver to increase co-pays from $1 to $4. It’s a shame that being too poor for health care also means being too poor to buy favorable policies from elected officials.
Now think about those “nominal” increases within the context of the national cuts just signed into law by President Donald Trump: a $1.058 trillion reduction in spending on Medicaid over 10 years and an estimated 11.8 million people losing their health insurance. 
Tens of thousands of people in New Hampshire are about to lose their access to health care. And the resulting cost of uncompensated care in New Hampshire will climb by tens of millions of dollars.
Not only does that fit the definition of “penny-wise and pound-foolish,” there’s also a price far beyond money. Here’s how researchers Thomas Buchmueller and Helen Levy put it for the Brookings Institution back in April: “An informed, evidence-based debate on the merits of Medicaid and how it might be improved should always be welcome. But the evidence is now clear: Medicaid improves health. Cutting it will cost lives. Those are facts.” 
The Medicaid cuts are happening for one reason: to pay for tax cuts to grow generational wealth. But how do you gain the necessary public support among the lower and middle classes to make such deep cuts to a health care program viewed favorably by 83% of Americans (including 74% of Republicans, according to KFF) just so ridiculously rich people can become ridiculously richer? Well, you repeat one phrase over and over again until it becomes a policy earworm: “waste, fraud, and abuse.” Republicans don’t need data to discredit and dismantle aid programs, they just need an easy-to-remember slogan.   
And then there’s the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — another way that the American people have tried to make sure those with the least are not left behind.
In New Hampshire, SNAP helps more than 76,000 people avoid going hungry each year, according to the Food Research and Action Center. About 3,500 of them are military veterans, and more than 25,000 are children. Between 2019 and 2023, the center reports, about 77% of SNAP households included somebody who was working. 
But over the years, New Hampshire Republicans have consistently fought against investing in anti-hunger programs. As if that’s not bad enough, Ken Weyler, the chairman of the House Finance Committee, has even claimed that “there are no hungry children in New Hampshire.” 
So that’s the environment here in New Hampshire, and here’s what it looks like against the national backdrop: Starting in 2028, states will have to pay more toward SNAP benefits so the federal government can use the $6 billion a year it saves to pay for, you guessed it, tax cuts for the wealthy. A new SNAP work requirement will also save another $68 billion over 10 years, with the only downside being that everything in America gets worse for non-wealthy people. In short, SNAP benefits will decline and another lifeline will become harder to qualify for.
“When you reduce SNAP and Medicaid at the same time — which this bill does — you force people to choose between food and medicine. You push them closer to crisis, to chronic illness, to homelessness,” said USC professor Leah Gose earlier this month.
So there’s your Republican pound-foolish math, your 21st-century bootstraps — the myth that shapes our modern reality.
Or, as Alissa Quart called it in her book “Bootstrapped,” “the pernicious parable of the deserving rich.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SNAPposter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-23 15:57:03.268432

Ben Ray Luján, U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich and U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández during a news conference in Santa Fe during the 2025 legislative session. All three the week of July 21 called out the Trump administration for budget decisions and more impacting the state.New Mexico’s congressional delegation had words — many— for President Donald Trump’s administration this week.
On Wednesday, New Mexico Democratic U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján  wrote to Trump with detailed concerns about proposed reductions in the 2026 Fiscal Year budget for the Department of Energy, including a 14% reduction to the Office of Science; a 74% reduction to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy; and a 57% budget cut to the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy.
“These proposed changes jeopardize not only our nation’s economic competitiveness,” Luján wrote, “but also our national security, energy independence, and capacity for innovation.”
The cuts to the Office of Science and EERE, he continued, “will have an immediate and destabilizing impact — threatening the continuation of critical research programs, leading to the loss of thousands of  skilled jobs.” 
Moreover, the budget cuts, Luján contended, will “scale back” fellowships, internships and research grants “that support tens of thousands of graduate and postdoctoral researchers,” while also impeding the national laboratories “critical role in translating federal  research into commercial success.”
ARPA-E, specifically, Luján wrote, “has funded over 1,000 high-risk projects, resulted in  over 700 patents, and attracted over $12 billion in follow-on private investment.”
The letter cited work at both Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory — clean rooms and GenBank, respectively — as examples of the “groundbreaking innovation coming out of the national labs” in New Mexico, before urging the president to “reconsider these reductions and restore full funding for DOE research and innovation programs.”
Fellow Democratic U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich, ranking member on the U.S. Energy and Natural Resources Committee, also registered significant concerns about the proposed budget last month during hearings.
Heinrich: Trump administration violating treaty obligations
Heinrich on Wednesday also levied criticism at the Trump administration in response to reports of the deleterious effects Trump’s executive order promoting “efficiency” has had on Gallup Indian Medical Center. 
Stat News reported that executive order spurred a new approval process for contracts that has subsequently created a “bottleneck leading directly or indirectly to delays in care and losses in medical services and personnel.”
In his statement, Heinrich said he was “appalled” at GIMAC’s “dismal” state.
“Despite the truly heroic work being done by providers there, burdensome and unnecessary red tape inflicted by the Trump Administration has caused this already overburdened hospital to cut down on essential services,” he said, adding that his office had received “numerous” reports that the facility had “slashed the number of beds available and scaled back maternal care. That’s not okay. If expectant mothers need an ultrasound or experience pregnancy complications overnight, they shouldn’t have to be flown to another facility to receive basic medical services. But that is the state of care right now.”
Heinrich called on Trump “to take immediate action” to repeal [Department of Government Efficiency] policies that are crushing this hospital,” noting that GIMAC needs “federal investment in a new location,” not policies that are “nearly bringing its operations to a halt.” The Trump administration’s actions, Heinrich concluded, “are a blatant and unacceptable violation of treaty obligations and must end now.”
U.S. Forest Service ‘failing’ to restore trust
Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, who represents New Mexico’s 3rd Congressional District, this week sent a letter to U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz about the Laguna Fire burning approximately 25 miles west of Abiquiú, which, as of Wednesday, had grown to nearly 17,000 acres. The Santa Fe National Forest on June 30 announced that lightning caused the 176-acre fire and said the agency would “actively manage” the blaze. On July 12, the agency said a spot fire had ignited outside of containment lines the day prior. Before the spot fire escaped, the fire had reached about 12,000 acres and was 87% contained. 
Laguna Fire grows to more than 15,000 acres after spot fire escapes management boundaries

In her letter, Leger Fernández contended that the fire “is currently destroying thousands of acres of the Santa Fe National Forest and has killed and maimed the livestock of local ranchers in Rio Arriba County.” Moreover, in the aftermath of events such as the controlled burn that led to the devastating Hermits Peak/Calf Canyon fire, “communities in northern New Mexico have completely lost trust in the agency’s wildfire decision-making,” she wrote.
Leger Fernández’s letter also included a list of questions to Schultz, including why a “strategy of full containment” wasn’t a “top priority”; whether Forest Service staff reductions had influenced the agency’s response to the fire; what type of communication the Forest Service had occurred with local ranchers whose cattle grazed in the fire area; and what type of compensation would be available to those ranchers who had lost livestock.
She concluded by citing a May 2022 letter she wrote to the agency’s previous Forest Service Chief Randy Moore in which she expressed concern “about the prospects of another fire resulting from a prescribed burn and the level at which USFS engages with the local community when planning these events.”  That letter was written in the aftermath of Hermits Peak/Calf Canyon — the largest wildfire in New Mexico’s history.
“I hoped that the Forest Service could make strides in the long process of restoring the community’s trust,” Leger Fernández wrote this week to Schultz. “This incident indicates the Forest Service is failing.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/HK7A0914-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-23 15:57:03.268432

Those in the cannabis industry are saying that the strict advertising laws on cannabis hurt their businesses while those on the other side say that the laws need to be more stringent. 
The post Mass. lawmakers weigh competing bills on cannabis advertising requirements  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE JOINT COMMITTEE on Cannabis Policy heard testimony on Tuesday about an issue that has been bubbling up in the industry: Should cannabis companies be allowed to advertise, run discounts, or have sales?
There are currently strict limitations governing how cannabis companies can advertise. Dispensaries are prohibited from advertising in any medium where 85 percent of the target audience is not expected to be 21 or older, and they are not allowed to offer gifts, discounts, sales, points-based rewards, or any customer loyalty programs. 
The House passed a suite of cannabis legislation in June that did not address advertising. (Senate leadership has yet to weigh in on whether the chamber will be taking up cannabis legislation this session.) House lawmakers have filed five separate bills that would make advertising rules more strict – such as by banning billboard advertisements for cannabis products or changing how fines are imposed for advertising violations – to protect young people. Meanwhile, another bill filed by Sen. Dylan Fernandes of Falmouth– which has strong support from the industry – seeks to loosen restrictions on discounts and promotions to help struggling business owners compete more effectively.
Many in the cannabis industry have advocated for the ability to advertise more widely to level the playing field with multi-state cannabis companies that already advertise because they can afford to pay a fine. The Cannabis Control Commission issued an advisory in May 2024 that said that the agency had learned that some cannabis businesses in Massachusetts have been flouting advertisement regulations.
Cannabis operators also say that they are competing with intoxicating hemp products, which have proliferated across the state because of a federal loophole that defines hemp and cannabis differently. This means that hemp products – even though they contain the same main intoxicating substance – are not bound by the same advertising rules.
“Being able to advertise is how any business attracts new customers,” Nike John, the owner of The Heritage Club dispensary in Boston and one of the inaugural cohort of the Cannabis Control Commission’s social equity program, told CommonWealth Beacon. “Marketing is a function of all businesses.”
The 2016 ballot question that legalized recreational cannabis in Massachusetts proposed similar regulations to those governing alcoholic beverages, but cannabis has faced more stringent restrictions. Liquor stores and breweries are allowed to offer discounts and promotions that they can advertise.
The bill being pushed by the industry would keep the cannabis commission from prohibiting “advertising, marketing and branding of sales, discounts, and customer loyalty programs.”
“Since the industry launched, cannabis businesses have been held to a different standard, one that blocks us from offering basic tools like discounts, promotions, or even loyalty programs that every other industry takes for granted,” Phil Smith, owner of Freshly Baked Co. of Taunton, another social equity business owner, told CommonWealth Beacon. “This bill levels the playing field. It gives small social equity businesses like Freshly Baked a real shot at competing, growing, and building community relationships the same way liquor stores and breweries do every day.”
Opponents say that cannabis is harmful to children and that advertising can promote youth cannabis use. 
“For nearly 10 years, Massachusetts has failed to enact policies that protect public health from the harms of high THC cannabis,” said Amy Turncliff, a neuroscientist and a public health advocate who does therapeutic consulting on addiction disorders. “Prohibiting billboard ads is a simple, effective step.”
David Jernigan, a professor at Boston University’s School of Public Health who has authored a book on cannabis policy, testified in favor of a bill that would ban all billboard advertisements of non-prescription marijuana. In one study of 172 cannabis users between the ages of 15 and 19, he found that adolescents who see cannabis billboards even rarely are five times more likely to develop a cannabis use disorder.
“Billboards are the one form of marketing where you can’t change the channel, you can’t turn the page, you can’t click away from it,” said Jernigan. “If they’re in the environment and you’re young, you’re going to see it.”
The package of cannabis legislation that the House passed would increase purchasing and possession limits for cannabis, double the number of dispensaries one business can own, create an avenue for legal hemp beverages to be sold in liquor stores, restructure the cannabis commission, crack down on hemp-derived intoxicating products, and loosen existing requirements for medical marijuana businesses. The Senate has not indicated whether that chamber will be prioritizing cannabis reform in this session.
“The work before us remains urgent and deeply impactful,” said Sen. Adam Gomez of Springfield, one of the chairs of the cannabis committee. “The cannabis industry in Massachusetts is still young and evolving, and how we shape its future will have lasting consequences for equity, public health, labor rights, and also economic opportunity across the community.”

The changes, which take effect in 2026, also include expanded archery opportunities and allowing hunters to ‘earn’ a second buck tag.

The Vermont Fish and Wildlife Board approved new deer hunting rules last week including one that will allow hunters to harvest does with rifles during the regular November season. 
The rules passed on a 7-5 vote and will take effect in 2026. Current rules still govern the hunting season this year.
But next year, for the first time since the 1980s, hunters in Vermont will be able to hunt female and antlerless deer using rifles and shotguns during the regular deer season if they purchase and receive an antlerless permit. Currently, hunters can harvest antlerless deer during archery, muzzleloader and other special seasons, but not during the 16-day November firearm season. 
Department of Fish and Wildlife biologists have said the increased frequency of mild winters has led to increased deer survival. Changes to land use patterns have put more areas off limits to hunters, and fewer people are hunting. Now, more deer are competing with one another for limited food and habitat.

The new doe rule may be the tool the state needs to change the trend.
“We feel it’s necessary,” Nick Fortin, a wildlife biologist who leads the department’s deer and moose projects, told the board at a June meeting, noting the practice is common in other states.  
Hunters currently fill only about 14% of their antlerless permits, according to department data. Fortin expects that percentage will increase if hunters can use rifles. Plus, thousands of people only hunt during the November rifle season, opening up doe harvest to a new pool of hunters. 
Because the department expects hunters will harvest antlerless deer at a higher rate using rifles, the state will likely issue fewer antlerless permits. Like they are now, permits will be allocated by the wildlife management unit. 
Department surveys indicate that a majority of hunters under 55 support the change, and a plurality of hunters 65 and older oppose the policy. 
David Sausville, the department’s wildlife management program manager, said in an interview that health indicators like antler diameter and fawn numbers help the state’s biologists know when there are too many deer for certain regions. 
And while there may be fewer deer than generations past, that doesn’t mean Vermont’s habitat can support the cervids. 
“What I always try to reinforce with people, is ‘You’re right, you’re not seeing as many deer as you did in the 70s,’ but there’s still too many deer in certain areas because they’re impacting the habitat,” Sausville said, “and we’re not seeing the health indices in the deer that we would like to see.”
While the rifle doe rule drew the most attention during the public comment period, the board approved a number of other changes as well. 
The new rules create an ‘earn-a-buck’ program, which allows hunters to harvest two bucks during two different seasons if the first buck meets certain antler criteria and the hunter also harvests a doe. 
Starting in 2026, Archery season will continue through the regular firearm season. 
Also new, the department will designate expanded archery zones located in deer-dense areas, which staff hope will create new opportunities for antlerless deer harvest. 
In addition, hunters will be able to hold two antlerless permits at once in two different wildlife management units.

,DC,2025-07-23 18:24:57+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,FEMA acting chief defends response to Texas flood catastrophe as 'outstanding',Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fema-acting-chief-defends-response-texas-flood-catastrophe-outstanding,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration official running the Federal Emergency Management Agency testified Wednesday the response to flash flooding in Texas over the Fourth of July weekend served as an “outstanding” model for the rest of the country.His conclusions about the catastrophic flooding, which had a death toll of 135 and included extensive search and rescue operations, were questioned by several members of the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee holding the hearing.David Richardson, the senior official performing the duties of FEMA administrator, told the panel that he “can't see anything that we did wrong.”“The response in Texas, which was community-led, state managed and federally supported, brought the maximum amount of capability to bear in Texas at the right time and the right place,” Richardson said. “We made that happen and that is a model of how response should be done.”Richardson testified that in his view “emergency management is not a pile-on sport. It’s well coordinated, relies on personal relationships, it’s got to be exercised beforehand. And all those things came together on Texas’ worst day.”‘Texas got what they needed’Richardson told the panel that while he was on vacation when the Texas flooding began and for several days afterward, he “remained in my truck the whole time” making phone calls to state and federal officials.“Texas got what they needed when they needed it,” he testified.When asked by Texas Republican Rep. Brian Babin “what steps will FEMA take to ensure that something like this will never happen again,” Richardson said the agency works “as closely as we can with emergency managers in Texas and the local communities.”""Through mitigation grants, resilience and those type of efforts, we work with them to build the best emergency management system we can have,” Richardson said. “And as you saw in Texas, under the secretary's leadership and the president's leadership, it worked very, very well.” Arizona Democratic Rep. Greg Stanton, ranking member on the subcommittee, rejected Richardson’s characterization that the Texas response and recovery efforts were handled appropriately.“It haunts me that we could have had more urban search and rescue pre-positioned in place,” Stanton said. “We could have saved more of those people.”Stanton alleged that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s requirement that any contract costing more than $100,000 get her approval hindered federal search and rescue operations.“That bottleneck delayed urban search and rescue teams for more than 72 hours,” he said. “By the time many urban search and rescue teams reached Texas, no one had been found alive for days.”Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Scott Perry, chairman of the subcommittee, appeared to defend FEMA’s approach to the Texas flooding, saying it’s not possible for FEMA to pre-position resources for all flood warnings.“Flood warnings happen all across the country on a regular basis and FEMA doesn’t pre-position to every flood warning it gets because they would pre-position literally 365 days a year,” Perry said. “That having been said, with fast-moving disasters, like the one that occurred in Texas, it is not like a hurricane, which you can track, you can anticipate landfall or the location of the disaster to pre-position assets.”Call-in center in Texas floodsRichardson defended staffing and wait times for FEMA’s call-in center during the two-hour hearing, rejecting reports that people were unable to get through to representatives following the Texas floods.Stanton said that Noem’s sign-off policy on higher cost contracts caused issues here as well.""On July 5, less than 24 hours after the tragedy, FEMA’s call center contract expired because of this $100,000 sign-off policy,” he said. “The result, the vast majority of calls from survivors went unanswered. Families desperate for shelter and aid were met with silence.“Can you imagine losing a family member, losing your home and having your call go unanswered when you're looking for a lifeline?”Perry said that the subcommittee was told by another FEMA official that the call center prioritizes people in a disaster area when that disaster is ongoing, but emphasized the panel expected the correct information.“So you might be getting calls into the call center from across the country, but the ones outside the disaster response area are put kind of behind the ones that are priority, which is the disaster that's occurring now,” Perry said. “We don't want to say that anybody is distorting the truth, but we got to make decisions on the correct information.”Richardson testified that FEMA surged staff to the call center following the Texas flooding, but that Monday was an especially busy day for people contacting the agency.""All calls were answered within three minutes ... and no calls beyond 10 minutes. So it's from three to 10 minutes,” Richardson said. “And the vast majority of phone calls were answered. The questions were addressed.”Eliminate FEMA?Richardson declined to say whether the Trump administration will try to completely eliminate FEMA, saying that the president “wants a better emergency management capability.”President Donald Trump launched a FEMA review council earlier this year to assess how the agency, which is housed within the Department of Homeland Security, operates and where changes could be made.Trump and Noem have repeatedly said they think the federal government could get rid of FEMA. Richardson said he expects the review council to issue its recommendations later this year.",,,,2025-07-23 14:56:17.823019

Jared Golden is asking the U.S. House of Representatives’ Natural Resources Committee to continue shielding Maine lobstermen from new regulations to protect North Atlantic right whales until 2035. 
The Democrat from Maine’s 2nd Congressional District worked with the rest of the Maine delegation, as well as Gov. Janet Mills, to insert a provision in a 2022 federal omnibus funding bill to restrict new whale-related regulations on the lobster industry through Dec. 31, 2028. Because of their dwindling population, the government has sought to impose certain regulations to protect right whales, such as fishing restrictions in certain areas of federal waters during seasons when whales are present.
Now, Golden is pushing for a seven year extension to that moratorium, which was submitted by U.S. Rep. Nick Begich, a Republican from Alaska. The House committee’s Subcommittee on Water, Wildlife and Fisheries met Tuesday to discuss a draft amendment to the Marine Mammal Protection Act to create that extension.
The futures of right whales and lobstermen are entangled. Could high-tech gear help save them both?

Meanwhile, the regulations have been tangled up in lawsuits, fueling Golden’s argument that regulators need more time to incorporate updated research and data while fishermen could prepare for the new regulations. 
During the panel discussion, Golden urged his colleagues to support the amendment, arguing “it would give the government the time it needs to craft regulations based on real science, reliable data and input from Mainers. And it would give lobstermen the time they need to prepare for whatever additional costs and changes to their harvesting practices may be required by new regulations.” 
Found along the East Coast, right whales’ migratory paths overlap with highly productive lobster fishing areas in Maine and Massachusetts, making entanglements in fishing gear one of the major threats for the animals. With a population of less than 400 and even fewer reproductively active females, right whales are approaching extinction with more than half a dozen threats to their existence, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries. 
The Marine Mammal Protection Act, established in 1972, prohibits marine mammals from harassment, hunting, capturing or killing in U.S. waters, with some exceptions.
Golden said he has “serious concerns” with the law and would like to see it changed so it can’t be used to shut down entire fisheries and the communities they support. Maine’s lobster fishery is valued at more than $500 million, according to 2024 data from the Maine Department of Marine Resources.
Knowing the cultural and financial significance for Maine, Golden said one of his proudest accomplishments in Congress was the efforts in 2022 from the Maine delegation and Mills to enact the moratorium on right whale protection regulations and fund right whale research to provide additional data for regulatory decisions. 
Golden also submitted a letter signed by the Maine Lobstering Union, Maine Lobster Association, New England Fishermen’s Stewardship Association and Downeast Lobstermen’s Association in support of the draft amendment.  
“Maine’s fishermen are responsible stewards of our marine resources,” Golden said. “No one is more invested than they are in ensuring a healthy ocean ecosystem.”

Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, speaking to reporters on Jan. 11 at the Virginia State Capitol.Seventy-three members of Congress, led by U.S. Reps. Jennifer McClellan, D-VA, and  Paul Tonko, D-NY, wrote to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin to stop the roll back of Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS). 
The proposed rule changes would repeal all greenhouse gas emission standards for the power sector under the Clean Air Act, as well as repeal 2024 amendments to the MATS that some believe led to the retirement of some coal-powered plants across the nation. Virginia currently has three coal-fired power plants in operation in Chesterfield, Halifax, and Wise counties.
The MATS amendments further reduced the amount of mercury, arsenic, nickel, and other toxic emissions from power plants. The plants were expected to invest in technologies to improve operation methods to cut back on those emissions. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump gave more than a third of the country’s coal-fired plants two-year exemptions from the rule.
“Congress gave EPA authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate hazardous air pollutants, like mercury and arsenic from power plants,” the representatives’ letter said. “Rolling back the MATS rule is a cruel abandonment of the agency’s statutory obligations that will endanger children’s health, harm communities, and let the worst industrial polluters off the hook.”
The EPA announced the rule rollback in June and said it would be reset to 2012 standards that the agency believes already significantly reduced emissions. 
“According to many, the primary purpose of these Biden-Harris administration regulations was to destroy industries that didn’t align with their narrow-minded climate change zealotry. Together, these rules have been criticized as being designed to regulate coal, oil and gas out of existence,” Zeldin said in a June statement.
The representatives are greatly concerned with the severe, disproportionate health effects the toxins have on communities on the fenceline and down-wind of the power plants. Mercury pollution also settles into waterways, impacting  fish that could be consumed by people or animals. The rule amendment aimed to reduce a thousand pounds of mercury emissions.
“Mercury pollution harms infants and children by causing permanent brain damage with long-term harms such as development delays, learning disabilities, and birth defects. Due to environmental injustice, communities of color and low-income communities are more likely to live near coal-fired power plants and be exposed to this dangerous pollution,” the letter read.
The EPA  estimated the rollback of the MATS amendments would save $1.2 billion in regulatory costs for the oil and coal industry over a decade. The agency previously predicted $300 million in health benefits over the same period with the amendments in place, putting industry and human health at odds according to the congressional delegation.
“By rolling back the MATS rule, the Trump Administration is choosing corporate polluters over the health and lives of everyday Americans across the country,” the letter said.
The congressional representative asks the EPA to allow 75 days for public comment and the host multiple hearings on the rule change. They said the current 55 days and one public hearing is not enough to get a full understanding of the impact stemming from the change.

(Photo by Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)BOONTON — Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli announced Morris County Sheriff Jim Gannon as his pick for lieutenant governor Wednesday at Johnnies Tavern in Gannon’s hometown.
Gannon, 64, who is serving his third term as sheriff, fired up supporters crowded inside Johnnies with attacks on Trenton’s Democratic leadership and a pledge to flip the governorship to GOP control after November’s general election. Ciattarelli will face Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill.
“New Jersey, under one-party Democratic rule in Trenton, is broken,” Gannon said. “Trenton Democrats are rewarding lawbreakers and coddling criminals, while making things harder for all the good people who work hard and play by the rules.”
Gannon asked the crowd if they are better off now than they were before Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, was elected in 2017, and it responded that they are not. He said it is time for a change.
“Phil Murphy, Mikie Sherrill, and Trenton Democrats made this mess. That last thing we should do is to trust them to clean it up,” Gannon said. “That is why, over these next 104 days, I plan to do everything in my power to spread Jack’s positive message of common-sense solutions and transformative change for our state.”

Before becoming sheriff, Gannon was a patrol officer in Boonton Township and Boonton, deputy chief of investigations in the Morris County Prosecutor’s Office, and served on the FBI’s joint terrorism task force. He was also head of security risk at Morris County-based Novartis Pharmaceuticals.
Gannon was elected to his first three-year term as sheriff in 2016. He won nearly 60% of the vote when he ran for reelection in 2019 and ran unopposed in 2022.

Though Morris County has been trending Democratic in some elections, it votes Republican in gubernatorial races. Much of it is represented in Congress by Sherrill.
“I read a quote from someone this morning that said, ‘Thank you, Jim, for all your excellent work, and making this community better.’ That was Mikie Sherrill,” Ciattarelli said.
Sherrill posted a picture of herself with Gannon on social media in 2021, a post that praised the Morris County Sheriff’s Office, saying it has “aided law enforcement & kept communities safe.”
Gannon said his policy priorities if elected with Ciattarelli include cutting property taxes and capping them based on home value, freezing property taxes for seniors, expanding energy production, lowering electricity bills, revising the school funding formula, and restoring cooperation between U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and local law enforcement.
“We’re a campaign that’s about people, not power or politics. Jim Gannon’s always been a man of the people,” Ciattarelli said. “And this campaign is all about a vision for New Jersey, not division.”
State Sen. Tony Bucco (R-Morris), who spoke at the event, said voters are fed up with the state’s direction.
“People are making hard choices – whether to buy medicine or put food on their table. That’s not the New Jersey I know and love,” Bucco said.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)All of Utah is now in either moderate or severe drought, which is causing the state’s lakes and reservoirs to decline at an abnormally fast rate.
According to a report this week from the Utah Division of Water Resources, the state’s reservoir levels dropped by about 10% between June 1 to July 1 — levels typically drop by about 2% during that timeframe.

“Unfortunately, our storage is declining at a concerning rate,” said Candice Hasenyager, director at the Utah Division of Water Resources, during a news conference at the Jordanelle Reservoir on Monday. “This dramatic decrease in storage is a clear signal that we need to watch how we use our water more closely than ever before.”
Abnormally dry weather, coupled with an underwhelming spring runoff season, have resulted in all of the state now experiencing some kind of drought. The desert regions in eastern and western Utah are now in severe drought, which means the air quality is worsened by dust, cattle have inadequate water, and pasture and streams and ponds are drying out, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.
Higher elevation areas in central Utah are in moderate drought, which limits feed for cattle, negatively impacts soil moisture and begins to dry out natural springs.

 Southern Utah reservoirs now at meager water levels

That’s resulted in a statewide decline in reservoir levels. Earlier this month, almost all of northern Utah’s reservoirs were above 90% capacity — now, Porcupine, Jordanelle, Strawberry and Currant Creek reservoirs are the only bodies of water in Utah above 90% capacity.
And some reservoirs in the south are now at meager levels. Lake Powell, the second-largest reservoir in the country, is at 32% capacity; Yuba Reservoir is at 20%; Piute Reservoir is at 22%: and Panguitch Lake is at 50%.
Statewide, the average reservoir level is 75%.
Meanwhile, the Great Salt Lake is currently at about 4,192 feet in elevation, several feet below 4,198, the minimum for what’s considered a healthy range. Lake levels peaked in April at about 4,193 feet, and according to the Division of Water Resources, will continue to decline until temperatures drop and the irrigation season ends this fall.
Some water providers have now imposed restrictions on water usage and irrigation — to see if your provider is enforcing restrictions, visit the Utah Department of Natural Resources’ website.

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-23 17:56:04+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mother drives 45 minutes for day care. Another pays more than her rent. Welcome to Mississippi’s child care crisis,Leonardo Bevilacqua,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/23/welcome-to-mississippi-child-care-crisis/,"Mississippi moms have faced child care worries exacerbated by federal funding cuts, high costs and dwindling options.","Child care worries have been made worse this summer by federal cuts and depleting pandemic funds, and they aren’t expected to ease by the first day of school. While their kids might have gotten a rest, parents reported longer commutes and newfound stress.
A dozen parents from across the state told Mississippi Today about summer child care plans for their toddlers and elementary school-aged children. They shared a mix of anxiety about finding care and frustration with existing options.
Parents have had more reasons to be anxious about those options this summer than in previous ones. A loss of federally funded summer programming for youth, added fees for day care tuition and the loss of vouchers to subsidize tuition costs have changed the landscape of child care.

For Shequite Johnson, a professor at Mississippi Valley State University, it has meant driving 45 minutes in the opposite direction of her job for day care.
“I’ve had to leave my 13-year-old with my 4-year-old,” she said. “And you’re put in a situation where you have to make these decisions. Some are even leaving their babies at home by themselves for five hours and checking on them during lunch hour.”
She had to pull her 4-year-old boy from a day care in her hometown because of excessive fees. She was charged a $20 late fee at pickup, a $100 registration fee for each of her two boys, and a $150 supplies fee that was announced in June on top of the $135 weekly fee.
The Mississippi Department of Human Services recently announced a cutback on vouchers that subsidize child care costs. Without Johnson’s child care voucher, her nearby options were limited to a city-run program in an unsafe neighborhood and three programs in aging facilities.
Delta Health Alliance runs free and reduced summer programming for elementary-aged children. But Johnson makes more than the income cut-off.
Carol Burnett, executive director of the Mississippi Low Income Child Care Initiative, speaks about a policy change by the Mississippi Department of Human Services, that removed a child support requirement for the Child Care Payment Program, at a news conference Monday, May 15, 2023, in Jackson, Miss. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)
“It’s a crisis right now in Mississippi,” said Carol Burnett, executive director of Mississippi Low-Income Child Care Initiative. “The lack of affordable child care prevents employers from keeping their workforce. And yet the state of Mississippi wants people to go back to work.”
“Parents are having to make choices. And none of them are good,” she added.
The Child Care Initiative operates a program that connects single moms with higher-paying jobs and covers the costs of child care during the transition. The organization is also advocating for the Mississippi Department of Human Services to spend some of the $156 million in unspent Temporary Assistance for Needy Families on Mississippi’s Child Care Payment Program.
The Child Care Development Fund, which nationally supports these voucher state programs, relied on pandemic-era funding that ran out in September. The Department of Human Services asked the Legislature for $40 million to continue serving the same number of families – but received $15 million.
In April, the department put a hold on renewals for child care vouchers except for deployed military parents, parents who are TANF recipients, foster children guardians, teen parents, parents of special needs children and homeless parents. As a result, 9,000 parents lost child care assistance.
The department will keep the hold until the number of enrollees drops to 27,000 or its budget goes below $12 million in monthly costs. As of Friday, it had no further update but said it will have an announcement in the next couple of weeks.
Using TANF funds unspent from past years regardless of whether they were allocated for child care assistance is prohibited, according to federal guidance. However, the TANF state office can use the leftover funds to form a direct payment program. Ohio and Texas enacted this policy. 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services regional manager Eric Blanchette shared this idea with Mississippi Department of Human Services Early Childhood Director Chad Allgood, according to an email obtained as part of a records request filed by Mississippi Today into communication regarding TANF funds. As of Friday, there were no plans to enact a similar policy in Mississippi.

“It’s more than I’ve paid in rent,” she said. “It’s why I live with my family now.”
She uses a Jackson day care that charges $10 per minute for late pickup. The fees must be paid by the next morning. 
Nearly all of the single mothers interviewed said they take on extra work to cover the rising costs of child care in their area. It’s extra work that sees them spending less time with their children.
Ashley Wilson’s child care voucher wasn’t renewed in the spring. She works 55 hours a week at a bingo hall and at Sonic Drive-In.
“We don’t get help. That’s what I don’t understand,” said Wilson, an Indianola parent.
Her preferred day care option in Indianola charged $185 per week and $20 late fees, which Wilson could not afford. Her sister was able to afford monthly costs because of an arrangement with an Angel – a benefactor who helps local families with tuition at day care providers.
Wilson tried other day cares in town. Several were in dangerous neighborhoods with staff that left milk bottles to spoil. Her toddler came home wet some afternoons and with cuts another. She gets help from family when she can.
Whitney Harper lost her child care voucher in April. She is lucky when a relative is willing to watch her 2-year old. Lately, she has considered hiring a sitter off care.com, a website that connects parents with local babysitters. In Jackson, where she lives, the hourly rate is $14 per hour.
Most of the day cares in the Jackson metro area charge between $150 and $250 per week, which is more than she can afford as a sales associate at Home Depot.
“It has been harder this year. They won’t work around my schedule, but I need the job,” she said of her employer.
‘This is the worst I have seen it’
Day care centers are left on the brink when families lose child care vouchers. Making up the lost revenue has meant higher tuition and fees for some centers and reaching out to private donors for others.
“These are small businesses,” Burnette said. “The big story in child care is how much it costs to run it. It requires adequate public investment.”

This week, Level Up Learning Center owner and CEO Kaysie Burton visited Greenville’s Walmart, seeking to persuade the manager to sponsor his employees’ child care tuition. She submitted two grant applications and is working on at least three others. Burton’s business survived flooding and relocation. But the latest voucher cutback could shut her banner-adorned doors to the community
At Level Up Learning Center, 75% of parents rely on child care vouchers. In the last three months, 20 Learning Center parents have lost their child care vouchers yet most have stayed. Burton has a policy of not turning parents away if they are willing to contribute a portion of the weekly rate. She has not increased her tuition or instituted punishing fees.
But making up the lost revenue can be a challenge. Since the cutback, she has let seven teachers go, or roughly a third of her staff. 
“We’re down to skin and bones right now,” Burton said. “I am willing to take anybody that is willing to come partner with us and help us help parents so that their kids can keep coming in.”
When Burton started her business during the COVID-19 pandemic, she saw the need in the Mississippi Delta for affordable, quality child care. She remains committed to helping prepare a future generation of Greenville leadership.
“We’re in the thick of it with our parents,” Burton said. “And we all just need help and we need prayer.”
SunShine Daycare owner Barbara Thompson has greeted each parent at the door since she started babysitting neighbors’ kids in her living room. The former banker has long had a passion for raising neighborhood children regardless of their parents’ status or income. She raised her seven siblings when her mother died when Thompson was 12.
But for the first time in 30 years of running a business in Greenville, Thompson is losing families by the dozen as well as longtime staff. She has leaned heavily on prayer and has reached out to state representatives for help. She fears more departures and the downsizing of her business.
In the last two months, 12 parents pulled their kids from SunShine. She will have to let three teachers go as a result. 
“We won’t have any children if this continues,” Thompson said.
She regularly informs parents of the child care voucher waitlist and of the process for renewals. Besides caring for children, Thompson advises many young parents in her community. She noticed that state agencies communicate primarily through email, which a lot of her parents don’t check regularly.
Children who leave her stoop festooned with cartoon characters can face hours alone without parental supervision. Some children will sit and watch television with their grandparents. For Thompson, child care is about raising children to be “productive citizens.” The youngest years are some of the most important, she stressed. 
“They didn’t take it from us,” Thompson said. “They took from the children. That’s the world’s future.”
Waitlisted
Vennesha Price is waitlisted at nearly every day care in Cleveland, where she lives. She’s been on some of the lists for eight months. 
“If you haven’t been a resident for five years and you haven’t navigated the waiting list for five years, it’s harder to find a spot,” she said. 
She found it difficult to both have a productive work day and watch her elementary-aged children. Eventually, she found a day care that was 40 minutes away. She wakes up an hour earlier to make the commute in time before work.
“I’m a single mother so it’s very difficult,” Price said. “After my grandmother went on to the Lord, it became a struggle trying to get to the day care in time.”
She started factoring late fees into her monthly budget. She’s also including the gas money needed for the extra legs of her commute. Her child care costs doubled for June and July.
“It’s almost like private school tuition now,” she said.

Lee and Stephanie Chatfield are alleged to have funneled money from their political nonprofit accounts to fund a lavish lifestyle, and will stand trial for embezzlement and other charges related to their activities.
The pair was bound over to Ingham County Circuit Court in May and a first pre-trial conference was scheduled for Wednesday morning. Court records show that a trial start date was scheduled for August.

Mary Chartier, attorney for Lee Chatfield, and Matt Newburg, attorney for Stephanie Chatfield, met with Assistant Attorney General Kahla Crino during an off the record court proceeding on Wednesday.
Following that conference, which was more of a formality, the attorneys agreed to hold a second pretrial conference on October 22.
That further pushes out the Chatfields’ trial date, which would begin sometime after late October at the earliest.
The Department of Attorney General’s case against the Chatfields asserts that, beginning in 2021, the Chatfields had allegedly for years used nonprofit money to reimburse themselves for purchases at luxe stores like Coach, items at amusement parks like Universal Studios, while Lee Chatfield also spent lavishly at strip clubs and partied with his associates and brothers.
An investigation into Chatfield began after his former sister-in-law reported to Lansing police an allegation that he had sexually assaulted her for years, starting when she was 14 or 15 years old. 
Michigan State Police probed the allegations and found evidence of potential financial improprieties – an investigation that was later taken over by Attorney General Dana Nessel.

Something will happen at the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame Class of 2025 induction banquet Saturday night that may never have happened before. That is, a player and one of his coaches will be inducted, together, on the same night.
That’s right: Former Ole Miss football hero Dexter McCluster will be inducted, along with former Southern Miss football hero Derrick Nix, who was McCluster’s position coach in Oxford.

Rick Cleveland
Said Nix, “When I found out I was going into the hall of fame with Dexter, I thought to myself that this can’t be anything but a God thing. … Dexter is one of my favorites. Going in with Dexter is a privilege and an honor.”
Most fans will know that Nix and McCluster are two of the most productive backs in Mississippi football history. What many might not know is that they had two of the biggest hearts. With both, you got the best they had to give every Saturday. And both had to overcome very different obstacles to become the Hall of Famers they are.
You should also know this: They are a two-man mutual admiration society. McCluster calls Nix one of “my favorite ever coaches because of the way he loved and respected the game. He coached with so much energy and passion. He was always going to put you in a position to be the best player you could be.”
Says Nix of McCluster, “He might have been a little guy, but he had a heart as big as Vaught-Hemingway Stadium.”
Nix, despite severe health issues, ran for 3,584 yards and 30 touchdowns over approximately three full seasons at Southern Miss at the turn of the century. McCluster, often the tiniest man on the field, produced 3,698 yards and 22 touchdowns running and receiving over four seasons (2006-2009) at Ole Miss.
They were two starkly different backs. At 220 sculpted pounds, Nix was a big, strapping, powerful runner who could run over you or around you. McCluster was a scatback who played much of his Rebel career at just under 160 pounds. I remember the late Carl Torbush, then the defensive coordinator at Mississippi State, talking about McCluster after the 2009 Egg Bowl: “He’s the fastest man I’ve ever seen in a football suit. There may be faster runners on a track, but I’m not sure there’s ever been a faster man in pads. If he gets a step on you he’s gone.” 
McCluster went on to play seven years in the NFL, making the Pro Bowl in 2013. Nix never got that chance, although had he been healthy, he surely would have been an NFL star.
Dexter McCluster was unmatched at making people miss.
Said Dan Rooney, a Pittsburgh Steelers personnel director and longtime executive: “Derrick Nix had it all. He reminded me a lot of Deuce McAllister. He had a gliding style, but he also had great running ability. He could break tackles with power, but he also had good enough feet that he could be elusive in open space. And once he broke loose, he could finish a run. He was a can’t-miss prospect, the kind any NFL team would love to have.”
Nix, one of the most highly recruited players in USM history, surpassed 1,000 yards rushing in both his freshmen and sophomore seasons before severe kidney problems stopped him as a junior in 2000. With Nix, USM won five of its first six games, losing only a 19-17 heartbreaker to Tennessee and beating both Alabama and Oklahoma State by three touchdowns. Without Nix, the Golden Eagles lost three of their last five.
But then, after sitting out the entire 2001 season, Nix came back to rush for 1,194 yards as a senior, including a 202-yard effort against defending Big 10 champion Illinois. In that one, he ran for a 50-yard touchdown and then collapsed in the end zone, throwing up from exhaustion. Turns out, he had been playing with about 10% of his normal kidney function. Nix received a kidney transplant from an older brother shortly after that season and remains healthy and robust at 45. He just never could play football again.
“Sometimes, I wonder what would I could have done if I had remained healthy,” said Nix, now the offensive coordinator at Auburn after 16 years in Oxford. “You can’t help but wonder, but I can’t complain about the way things turned out.”
This will tell you something about Nix: McCluster never knew that about his coach until interviewed for this piece.
“I knew he had been a great player but he never talked about it,” McCluster said. “I never knew about the kidneys, the illness and all that, but that just shows how much he loves football and how much the game meant to him. I do know that much. I knew that the first time I met with him.”
McCluster now lives in Brentwood, Tennessee, where he works as a personal trainer and part-time high school football coach. “My real job is I’m a girl dad. We have five beautiful daughters,” McCluster says.
Nix is a girl dad himself with one daughter he dotes on.
Both men call this Saturday’s induction a career highlight, made all the more special because they will experience it together.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — Former State Sen. Justin Wayne announced Wednesday that he would seek election as Douglas County District Court clerk in 2026. 
Wayne represented a district in North Omaha for eight years in the Nebraska Legislature, being term limited out in 2024. During that time, he chaired the Urban Affairs and Judiciary Committees and prioritized policies on economic development and criminal justice, particularly within the state’s juvenile court system.

Wayne’s candidacy follows an announcement earlier this week that current District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades was joining the race to be the Democratic nominee in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District. 
Wayne said he is seeking this office because he has experience he can contribute as a working private attorney, and the duties would allow him to continue helping the community while also allowing him to balance time with his family.
In a campaign press release, Wayne pledged to modernize the clerk’s office, expand public access, and strengthen public confidence in the justice system through transparency, efficiency and accountability.
“Douglas County deserves a clerk who brings both legal experience and a deep understanding of how the justice system affects everyday people,” Wayne said in the release. “As an attorney, former legislator, and lifelong advocate for justice reform, I’ve seen firsthand how critical this office is to ensuring the courts work for everyone.”
The District Court Clerk’s Office manages vital court records, coordinates courtroom operations and communicates with the public. Wayne said his combined legal and legislative background uniquely positions him to strengthen the office and improve service delivery — without increasing costs to taxpayers.
Wayne listed his campaign priorities, including modernizing systems to streamline records, expanding public access to the court, improving staff training and enhancing transparency and responsiveness.
“This office is the nerve center of our justice system,” Wayne said. “Every motion filed, every judgment recorded, every person seeking their day in court depends on the clerk’s office functioning with precision and integrity. When this office runs well, justice is served fairly and efficiently. When it doesn’t, people fall through the cracks.”

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)A coalition of voting rights activists denounced efforts to disenfranchise North Carolina voters in state elections, rallying at the Capitol grounds on Wednesday in the shadow of the state Supreme Court.
Members of the “Court the Vote” coalition — made up of voting rights and progressive groups in the state such as Progress NC Action, the Justice Project, and Flip NC — gathered in Raleigh before a crowd of around 40 to raise awareness of voter suppression efforts, with a focus on the state courts.
Speakers trained much of their condemnation on Judge Jefferson Griffin’s efforts earlier this year to overturn the results of the 2024 North Carolina Supreme Court election, as well as on Chief Justice Paul Newby and Associate Justice Phil Berger Jr., who they identified as responsible for partisan maneuvering on the court.
“The court behind us, the Newby-Berger majority on the state Supreme Court, has repeatedly demonstrated that they are willing to put politics before people, whether it’s attacking voting rights, overturning fair maps, or blocking duly elected justices,” said Julian Wolff, program director for the Justice Project — a national nonprofit that works to promote impartial state courts and secure democracy. “We remember what this court did to disenfranchise voters, especially veteran and active duty military voters.”
Griffin sought to invalidate votes cast by military and overseas voters who did not provide photo ID with their absentee ballots, which he argued was a violation of state election law. The North Carolina Supreme Court ruled in his favor on the issue, but a federal court intervened to prevent ballots from being discarded.
Tysen Moy, a UNC School of Law student and Army veteran, said that if he were still overseas, his ballot could have been tossed out. “I didn’t bring my driver’s license with me to Iraq, and you’re not allowed by law to make a scan of a military ID. What would I have done?” he asked.
Also speaking at the rally was Cat Lawson, voter protection director for the North Carolina Democratic Party. She said while she wished voter rights were not a partisan issue, the reality is that “we only have one party that’s actually committed to doing the work to protect voting rights in North Carolina.”
“Voter suppression looks like having your mom’s absentee ballot get rejected because a check mark was deemed unreadable by a newly Republican-controlled county board of elections,” Lawson said. “It looks like your elderly neighbor being confused about their polling site, because Republican county commissions are deciding that public schools and other public spaces can’t be used for polling sites anymore.”

Among the rally observers were veterans, lawyers, and a broad spectrum of activists. Dave Ramirez, a friend of Moy’s and a U.S. Army Airborne veteran who attended the demonstration, called the Griffin challenge “pathetic” and said he hopes a lot of people start paying more attention to politics.
“I want to see bigger turnouts and stuff,” he said. “I think there are enough angry people out there — you know, not so much angry, but just not happy with the current political situation — I just hopefully want to see more people out.”
Denise Sturdy, a longtime corporate attorney who said she “worked for the Republicans my entire career,” warned that if the General Assembly succeeds in passing an overhaul of the state elections board that would replace a large portion of staff positions with political appointees, “your votes are going to be suggestions.”
“I am so happy the [Supreme Court challenge] was resolved the way it was, because had it fallen the other way, that would have been nationwide; that would have happened all across the United States,” she said.
Closing out the rally speeches was Melissa Kromm, executive director of North Carolina for the People Action, who stressed that “our rights are under attack,” most prominently the right to vote. She said her child was among those whose ballot was challenged.
“Here in North Carolina, we have judges who embrace partisanship and put party loyalty and ideology above the law and above the constitution,” Kromm said. “We deserve courts that are fair, independent, and accountable to the people, not to partisan operatives or corporate wealthy donors.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7232656-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-23 13:57:36.054826

(File photo from Getty Image)Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier led a legal brief signed by 17 other Republicans that urges the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a case in which two Christian schools were barred from offering a prayer over a stadium loudspeaker before a high school football championship game.
State attorneys general signing on to the filing known as a friend-of-the-court brief include South Carolina’s Alan Wilson.
The case arose from a 2015 game between Cambridge Christian School, a private Christian school in West Tampa, and University Christian School in Jacksonville.
The Florida High School Athletic Association banned the schools from reciting a prayer over the loudspeaker, saying that it would violate the establishment clause in the Constitution’s First Amendment, which has been interpreted as a ban on government endorsing one religion over others.


What does the First Amendment say?
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.


The teams did pray on the field, but it wasn’t audible to the crowd, leading Cambridge Christian to sue the athletic association, which comprises member public and private schools and is authorized by the Florida Legislature to oversee school sports.
The case has bounced between the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit over the past decade. A three-judge 11th Circuit panel sided with the sports association last year, prompting the appeal by Cambridge Christian to the Supreme Court.
Uthmeier and his fellow Republican attorneys general argue that Cambridge Christian’s proposed pregame prayer should have provoked no objections about violating the establishment clause.
They contend the lower appeals court erred by invoking the Supreme Court’s 2000 decision in Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe, which they insist was wrongly decided and should be overruled.
“The Constitution does not require state-sponsored hostility toward religion — especially not in a moment as meaningful as pre-game prayer,” Uthmeier said in a press release. “We are urging the Court to correct this misinterpretation and ensure that students do not have to hide their faith on the playing field.”
In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court sided with a football coach in Washington state, ruling his prayers on the 50-yard-line after games were protected by the First Amendment.
Other officials who have filed amicus briefs in support of Cambridge Christian School include former University of Florida star quarterback Tim Tebow, former Clemson University football coach Tommy Bowden, and former Florida Speaker of the House Will Weatherford.
Other attorneys general who signed the brief are from Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia.

The move follows the recent launch of a federal civil rights investigation at the school that triggered an outpouring of support for the school and Washington, the first Black president, from students, alumni, Democratic Virginia legislators and the state’s first Black governor.
Students, faculty, and lawmakers rally behind GMU amid Trump administration civil rights probe

The GMU chapter of the American Association of University Professors (GMU-AAUP)’s formalization of its displeasure with the governing board on Tuesday with a vote of no confidence, indicates that the voting majority lacks support for a leader or governing body.
“Mason’s Board of Visitors has shown time and again that they care more about their partisan agendas than their duty to support and advance Mason’s public mission,” said GMU-AAUP President Bethany Letieca in a statement on Wednesday. “The board’s failure to defend President Washington from a politically motivated pressure campaign was the final straw.”
The GMU-AAUP’s resolution accuses the board of “abdication of its fiduciary duty,” or failing to fulfill their responsibilities as members, after four federal investigations were launched by the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice targeting the institution’s diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, employees employment practices, treatment of students and a separate investigation into alleged antisemitism on campus.
The GMU-AAUP also criticized the board for its decision to hire Torridon Law PLLC, a firm founded by former U.S. Attorney General William Barr and staffed by attorneys connected to President Donald Trump’s administration. 
The chapter argues that this action compromises the university’s defense and aligns the board with partisan attacks. It warns that the investigations are part of a larger effort to “politicize” and “control” the university.
“Look, it’s not complicated,” GMU-AAUP Vice President Timothy Gibson said in a statement on Wednesday. “The Trump administration wants to push out GMU President Washington so they can replace him with a MAGA loyalist and exert control over GMU’s curriculum and governance.”
The Virginia Mercury has contacted George Mason for the board’s comment on the vote, ahead of a scheduled planning meeting on July 31 followed by its annual meeting Aug. 1.

What this means for the future of the project is unclear. A spokesman for the company behind the transmission line, Illinois-based Invenergy, could not be immediately reached for comment. 
The loan, which was issued by the Biden administration in November 2024, is being cancelled because “it is not critical for the federal government to have a role in supporting this project,” the department said in a news release announcing the decision. 
News of the cancelled loan was celebrated by Republican U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, who for years has criticized the project.
“The Grain Belt Express boondoggle loan has been cancelled,” Hawley wrote on social media. 
Hawley previously claimed he secured a pledge from U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright that he would be “putting a stop to the Grain Belt Express green scam.”

In the works for more than a decade, Grain Belt Express is expected to run from southwest Kansas carrying renewable energy through Missouri and Illinois before ending at the Indiana border. When it approved the project, the Missouri Public Service Commission found that Grain Belt would save Missourians $17 billion in lower electric bills. 
But to complete the project, the line needs to cross thousands of properties and requires easements on landowners’ properties across three states.
Invenergy says it has obtained the vast majority of those easements through voluntary negotiations with landowners. For the rest, the project was granted the right of eminent domain, a legal mechanism that allows utilities and governments to take land or easements from unwilling landowners and compensate them. 
Grain Belt’s ability to use eminent domain has drawn the ire of Republican lawmakers and farm groups who fought to undermine the project at the Missouri General Assembly for years.
“This is a huge win for Missouri landowners and taxpayers who should not have to fund these green energy scams,” Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey posted on social media. 
Invergy previously responded to Hawley’s criticism of the project with a post on social media calling the senator’s public comments “bizarre.”
“Senator Hawley is attempting to kill the largest transmission infrastructure project in U.S. history, which is already approved by all four states and is aligned with the president’s energy dominance agenda,” the company wrote earlier this month. “Senator Hawley is trying to deprive Americans of billions of dollars in energy cost savings, thousands of jobs, and grid reliability and national security, all in an era of exponentially growing electricity demand.”
The company also wrote a letter this month to Wright pleading its case and criticizing both Hawley and Bailey. 
“President Trump’s infrastructure agenda and your leadership are making America energy dominant, secure, and prosperous,” Jim Shield, vice president of Grain Belt Express LLC, wrote in the letter. “Unfortunately, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley and Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey are declaring open season on America’s ability to build needed energy infrastructure.”
Gretchen Waddell-Barwick, director of the Sierra Club Missouri Chapter, panned the decision to undermine the “shovel-ready Grain Belt Express transmission project that would quickly strengthen grid reliability and resilience, create jobs during construction, and lower electricity costs for small towns throughout Kansas and Missouri.”
Hawley doesn’t seem to care, Waddell-Barwick said, that the company played by the rules, received multiple state approvals and withstood legal challenges.
“This reeks of desperation to satisfy political interests,” Waddell-Barwick said, “at the expense of Missouri families and businesses throughout the state that may have to pay higher electric rates because of this decision.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/transmission-lines-2048x1536-1-e1734386271555-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-07-23 13:57:36.054826

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Three months ago, a tariff-driven market crash put Hasbro Inc.’s potential relocation plans on ice. 
But the Pawtucket-based toymaker now appears back on solid financial ground, buoyed by record sales in its digital gaming business and easing of reciprocal tariffs with China. 
“2025 will be the year Hasbro returns to growth, and we will do so backed by record operating margins,” CEO Chris Cocks said in a call with investors Wednesday morning, immediately following the release of Hasbro’s second-quarter earnings.
Cocks did not address a move to Massachusetts during the 75-minute call, nor were relocation plans noted in the company’s financial filings. The company was reportedly looking to abandon its century-old Rhode Island roots in favor of a more modern and transit-friendly alternative in or near Boston.
After President Trump’s April tariff announcement roiled markets, Hasbro officials postponed a decision on a potential move, promising an update would come this summer. The delay, combined with prior projections for $100 million to $300 million in annual revenue losses from the initial 145% reciprocal tariff with China — now scaled back to 10% — looked promising for Rhode Island’s ability to hang on to one of its top employers.
But after beating analysts’ forecasts in its second quarter earnings, Hasbro’s purse strings could loosen, especially if Massachusetts officials come through with tax incentives tied to a relocation. 
For now, Hasbro is keeping mum.
“We have no new updates to share,” Andrea Snyder, a Hasbro spokesperson, said in an email Wednesday.
Gov Dan McKee’s office also did not immediately return for comment regarding his last discussions with Hasbro executives.
The company maintains its 1,000-person workforce in Rhode Island, having not given notice of any mass layoffs to the state Department of Labor and Training this year, despite prior warnings that tariffs could force staffing cuts. Private employers with more than 100 workers are required to give state and local officials 60 days notice before cuts under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act.
Rhode Island leaders tried to entice Hasbro to stay within state lines, even if not at its Newport Avenue headquarters in Pawtucket, offering up a prime piece of undeveloped land in the I-195 Redevelopment District for $1. But more sweeping tax incentives, similar to what Massachusetts officials suggested in publicly released emails with Hasbro executives, were never put on the table for the Rhode Island General Assembly to consider during its 2025 legislative session.
Despite higher-than-expected second quarter revenue and an improved year-end outlook, Hasbro is not out of the woods yet. Toy sales fell, especially in North America, in the second quarter amid uncertainty over how the ongoing trade war with China might impact retail pricing and demand. Anticipating additional fallout from the reciprocal tariffs, the company recorded a $1 billion non-cash impairment in its consumer products arm, leading to an $854.7 million profit loss for the quarter that ended June 30.
However, the $981 million in net, second quarter revenue marks a 1% decrease over the second quarter of 2024, with adjusted operating profits of $247 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.30, a 7% increase year-over-year.
The magic of MAGIC: The Gathering
Much of Hasbro’s success rests upon its digital gaming business, including MAGIC: The Gathering, which saw revenue soar 23% compared with a year ago, with its latest product, Final Fantasy, marking the highest grossing release in MAGIC history in the wake of a June 13 debut. Final Fantasy also brought in record numbers of new players in its first two weeks, according to Hasbro.
“This isn’t just a one-off moment,” Cocks said during the earnings call. “It’s a clear indication of the power of MAGIC’S community, our release cadence, and the resonance of our Universes Beyond strategy.”
The company also reported growth in its licensing business, with positive outlooks supported by a newly inked, multi-company deal to bring Hasbro games to casinos and online gambling, including through Bally’s Corp., which runs Rhode Island’s casinos.
Still, the company continues to look to cut costs and drive down debt, now anticipating $175 million to $225 million in cost-savings this year through a combination of “cost discipline” and “opportunistic debt reduction,” Gina Goetter, Hasbro’s chief financial and chief operating officer, said on the earnings call.
Goetter did not provide details on future cost-cutting measures, including the impact to the local workforce.
Hasbro continues to shift its manufacturing away from China — where half of its toys are made — with the goal of cutting usage of Chinese materials and labor to less than 40% of products by 2026, Goetter said. At the same time, it has looked to move more production to the United States, including East Longmeadow, Massachusetts, where it already uses a European-owned manufacturing plant to make its board games. 
Hasbro stocks rose 3.2% in pre-market trading immediately after the company reported its second quarter earnings.

In a press release announcing the investigation the DOE specifically identified UM’s “U Dreamers Program.” 
The University of Miami did not immediately respond to the Florida Phoenix’s request for comment.
The University of Louisville, the University of Nebraska Omaha, the University of Michigan, and Western Michigan University are also being investigated for scholarships awarded to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and students living in the state without permanent legal status.
The investigations were launched based on complaints from the Equal Protection Project, part of the Legal Insurrection Foundation. On its website, EPP declares it’s “devoted to the fair treatment of all persons without regard to race or ethnicity.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
 EPP founder William A. Jacobson lauded the news of the investigation in the DOE press release. 
“Protecting equal access to education includes protecting the rights of American-born students. At the Equal Protection Project, we are gratified that the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights is acting on our complaints regarding scholarships that excluded American-born students. “Discrimination against American-born students must not be tolerated,” Jacobson said in the press release.
The “U Dreamers Program”  is the only scholarship at UM being investigated by the DOE’s Office of Civil Rights.
Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor said the investigation reflects President Donald Trump’s commitment to “put America first.”
“Neither the Trump Administration’s America first policies nor the Civil Rights Act of 1964’s prohibition on national origin discrimination permit universities to deny our fellow citizens the opportunity to compete for scholarships because they were born in the United States,” he said in the statement. “As we mark President Trump’s historic six months back in the White House, we are expanding our enforcement efforts to protect American students and lawful residents from invidious national origin discrimination of the kind alleged here.”
The University of Miami is a private college. The Legislature this year repealed a 2014 law that allowed DACA recipients to pay in-state tuition rates at public universities and community colleges.

Jennifer Jenkins, a former Brevard County school board member and founder of an organization designed to weaken conservative influence in local education policy, says she is considering entering the Democratic race for U.S. Senate next year in Florida.
The seat is held by Republican Ashley Moody, appointed to the position by Gov. Ron DeSantis in January. It was formerly held by Marco Rubio who resigned the post to serve as President Donald Trump’s secretary of state.
Jenkins, 38, served for one term on the school board, from 2020 to 2024. For the past year, she’s headed a political committee called Educated. We Stand. She created the committee to support school board candidates in battleground states and to beat back the conservative education policies promulgated by organizations like Moms For Liberty.
“I’m seriously considering it,” Jenkins told the Phoenix on Monday about entering the Senate race.
“It’s something that I’m not taking lightly. I’ve thought about this for the last several years. I’ve been entrenched in the fight for our public schools and meeting with grassroots Democrats and people across Florida, and I keep hearing the same thing over and over again — that people are sick and tired of people in power making excuses to not use that power to help regular people.
“And I keep getting asked the same question, if I’m going to run for Senate. So, I am having conversations with my family and the people closest to me who I trust.”
Jenkins said she doesn’t have a specific timetable for her decision.
To close observers of the Florida political scene, there is a sense of déjà vu to all of this. In late spring 2023, Jennings said she was considering entering the 2024 Senate race against Republican incumbent Rick Scott. She ultimately did not. Former South Florida U.S. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell was the Democratic nominee, losing to Scott by 13 points.

Jenkins’ tenure on the school board was marked by dramatic moments. An elementary school speech pathologist, she was elected to the board in a stunning upset victory over incumbent Tina Descovich, who would go on to co-found Moms for Liberty. (Gov. Ron DeSantis reappointed Descovich earlier this year to the Florida Commission on Ethics).
In a red district, Jenkins won by nearly double digits that summer; Donald Trump won Brevard County that November by more than 16 points.
Threats and harassment
That was the year that COVID-19 hit America, and Jenkins became a target of some conservatives for her advocacy for wearing masks on school campuses and supporting LGBTQ students. The only Democrat on a nonpartisan board, she received threats and harassment, an experience she described during a Democratic Party rally in Tampa in 2023.
“When I was sworn into office, I never expected that I would have the personal battle that I had,” she said. “Protests in front of my home. The vandalism on my property. Three-foot ‘F’-‘U’ letters burned into my lawn. Be followed by private investigators. Slanderous websites.’”
Jenkins said she was only going to serve one term and that decision was cemented for her when her (and another school board member’s) seat was redrawn during redistricting. Florida Today wrote in 2023 that the redrawn seats were held by “the two members who most often vote against the new right-leaning majority.
The episode inspired the founding of Educated. We Stand.
“Originally, when I first ran for office, I literally was an educator who was sick and tired of being paid so poorly with my husband, living paycheck to paycheck, being unable to prepare and save for my own daughter’s college and future. And so that’s why I stood up and fairly quickly got thrust into what we see as the war on public education now, and it inspired me to stand up for my community and to be a loud, outspoken activist,” Jenkins said.
“Towards the end of my term though, I never intended to run again but I did shift through the experiences that I had — some of them pretty horrific. I told myself there had to be a bigger ‘why.’ There had to be a bigger ‘why’ about why I had to go through that heartache and that experience with my family, and I felt like I needed to step up and do something bigger and continue to spread the message and advocate for public education.”
The Democratic field
The only major Florida Democrat to enter the Senate race for 2026 so far is Josh Weil, the Orlando educator who raised nearly $15 million in his losing bid to Republican Randy Fine in the special congressional election in Florida’s 6th Congressional District earlier this year.
Another potential candidate is retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel Alexander Vindman, whose testimony before Congress helped lead to President Donald Trump’s first impeachment trial. He’s now a resident of Broward County and has told reporters recently that, like Jennings, he is considering entering the contest.
Jenkins says she understands it’s a challenging environment for Democrats in a state where Republicans hold a more than 1.3 million lead in voter registration, but believes the party more than ever needs people to fight for “everyday families.”
“I’m tired of hearing that Florida is a lost cause, because I don’t believe that and I don’t want to be told that because that’s my family’s future we’re talking about — and I don’t want to hear that my family’s future isn’t worth fighting for,” she said.
“I was a minority voice here in Brevard County. I still won by 10 points in the year that Donald Trump won by 17. I know what’s possible when people show up and they speak out and they organize. We can win because everyday people care about what connects us and what’s best for our families, not what’s best for a political party that’s next to their registration on their voter registration card. So, I do believe it’s possible. I do think that we need someone who is authentic and willing to push back and tell it like it is and to be a fighter and just connect people as people.”
The winner of next August’s Democratic Senate primary will most likely face Moody in the general election, as the former state attorney general is not expected to face any serious opponents in her race for the Republican nomination next year. Moody has raised more than $2 million in her regular campaign account, and another federal super PAC aligned with her candidacy has raised $7 million, according to NBC News.
The winner of the 2026 Senate race will finish the last two years of Rubio’s term, then could run for re-election in 2028.

Worried about large numbers of workers without a nest egg, Nevada this month launched a new retirement program for private sector workers who lack access to one.
The program requires employers with six or more employees to participate — unless they already sponsor an employee retirement plan.
Employees, who can opt out, are automatically enrolled in an Individual Retirement Account, or IRA, through regular paycheck deductions.

Nevada State Treasurer Zach Conine hopes the new program, created by lawmakers in 2023, will boost financial literacy and ultimately reduce state costs on social services as more people save for retirement. He said about 500,000 workers were expected to be eligible under the plan — nearly a third of the state’s civilian labor force of 1.68 million.
“We don’t care broadly if someone stays on the Nevada plan or goes out and gets their own retirement savings plan,” said Conine, a Democrat who is running for state attorney general. “We care that people are saving for retirement.”

Nevada is among a growing number of states creating automatic retirement programs for employees of private employers. These programs, known as auto-IRAs, target employees without access to retirement programs through work, aiming to address what groups such as AARP characterize as a national retirement crisis.
So far, 20 states have created retirement programs for private sector workers, according to the Center for Retirement Initiatives at Georgetown University. Those programs are generally overseen by state treasurers and appointed boards. Private contractors administer the investment funds, which can fluctuate with financial markets.
AARP says more than 1 million Americans have enrolled in auto-IRA programs launched by states in recent years. But the group, which advocates for Americans aged 50 and older, says nearly half of private sector workers — 56 million people — still lack access to a retirement plan through work.
“In the long term, this is a problem we need to deal with. But in the short term for those individuals, this is a real crisis,” said David John, senior policy adviser at the AARP Public Policy Institute. “This is something that they are going to be facing soon, and our goal is to make sure that as younger people come along, they are much better prepared than some of the people who went before them.”
While anyone can open a savings or investment account, workers are far more likely to participate in retirement programs funded through simple payroll deductions, John said. And state auto-IRAs require little effort from employees and employers.
“Yes, anyone can go to a financial institution and open an IRA. But the bottom line is, they don’t,” he said.
Unlike state pension programs for public workers including teachers, these auto-IRAs are the sole possession of the worker. That means they are portable, and employees can even rely on those funds for emergency expenses at times, John said.
Some financial services firms have objected to these programs, arguing that they compete with private sector retirement providers.
So far, more liberal states have led the way on auto-IRA programs: Oregon launched the nation’s first in 2017, quickly followed by Illinois and California. But John said there’s growing interest in more conservative states: Nevada’s legislation was sponsored by Democrats, but ultimately signed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo.
“This is not a partisan political issue,” John said. “We are seeing strong interest in a number of red states.”
Launching new programs
In launching its new auto-IRA, Nevada elected to join an interstate consortium of public auto-IRA plans founded by the Colorado Department of the Treasury. By pooling resources and reducing overhead costs, officials say states can offer lower plan fees to savers.
“Relatively, it’s a lot of work to set one of these things up, but it’s a lot less work if you’re not first,” Conine said.
The Nevada treasurer’s office expected the launch of the program to cost about $1.2 million over two fiscal years — funds that were borrowed from the state and are to be paid back through the collection of retirement participant fees over time.
Colorado Treasurer Dave Young sees the state’s retirement program as both a social and financial cause: It helps workers save for a more dignified retirement and keeps the state from spending more on services in the long run, he said.
“If we don’t take this on and get more people saving for retirement, there’s this massive tax bill awaiting taxpayers to fund safety net services, and why would we do that to our taxpayers?” said Young, a Democrat. “Why not change the trajectory for people? It’s relatively actually a simple solution.”

A 2023 report from payroll and benefits company Gusto found the biggest boost in participation came among Coloradans earning the least. Before the mandate, 10% of employees earning $15,000 to $25,000 per year participated in a retirement plan — a share that nearly doubled to 19% afterward.
Gusto also found more small employers started offering 401(k) plans after the state’s program launched in 2022.
Colorado has signed up about 72,000 workers with more than $100 million in savings. About 20% of eligible employees choose to opt out, said Hunter Railey, executive director of the Colorado retirement program.
The state program requires all employers in operation at least two years with five or more employees to participate or offer their own retirement plan.
Railey said it’s an easy process to sign up employers and workers, though an initial challenge was identifying the state’s smallest employers. The state used its unemployment system database and explains the program requirement directly to businesses.
“The final step there is really just communicating effectively that these are required programs, and that failure to comply with this does carry penalties at some point,” Railey said. “…By and large, we found that most if not the overwhelming majority of businesses, if they receive a notice for their business, are going to take action.”
Pennsylvania State Treasurer Stacy Garrity, a Republican, has advocated for a state auto-IRA program. Legislation creating a program passed the Democratic-controlled state House by a single vote along party lines and now awaits action in the Republican-controlled state Senate.
Garrity, who also leads the National Association of State Treasurers’ retirement and pensions committee, said an auto-IRA plan would benefit Pennsylvania businesses, workers and taxpayers.
“These are people we all depend on every day, like the mechanic who keeps our car running and the waitress that tops off our coffee,” she said in a statement to Stateline. “Two million hardworking Pennsylvanians without access to workplace retirement plans deserve to have the same opportunity to save.”

The opposition

While state retirement programs are growing, they have faced industry opposition.
State chapters of the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents 600,000 small businesses across the country, have opposed some measures. In Pennsylvania, the federation said 84% of surveyed members opposed creation of an auto-IRA, arguing not all employees could afford to invest in retirement and that the new plans imposed too heavy a burden on small businesses.
The organization did not respond to requests for comment.
The National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors, which represents financial services providers in every state, says states should encourage private-sector options rather than setting up competing programs.










If we don't take this on and get more people saving for retirement, there's this massive tax bill awaiting taxpayers to fund safety net services, and why would we do that to our taxpayers?


– Colorado State Treasurer Dave Young


In a statement, Kevin Mayeux, CEO of the association, said access isn’t the only barrier to retirement savings. Many Americans, especially lower-income workers, must balance retirement savings against competing financial priorities including child care and rising costs of living.
The organization said it supports states’ interest in retirement savings, but that lawmakers should focus on private-sector options. Those could include multiple employer plans and pooled employer plans that make it easier for small employers to offer retirement plans at competitive rates.
“In short, NAIFA does not oppose efforts to improve retirement security; we welcome them,” Mayeux’s statement to Stateline said. “But we believe that empowering private-sector solutions, not replacing them with state-run programs, is the path to long-term success.”
But early success among participating states is inspiring more adoption, said Angela Antonelli, a research professor and executive director of the Center for Retirement Initiatives at Georgetown University.
In addition to amassing more than $2 billion in savings for workers, the state programs have encouraged employers to offer their own retirement plans, Antonelli said.
“It’s a huge return on the investment. It’s money well spent,” she said.
Antonelli said many participating workers are younger and will likely move into other jobs or careers over time. The hope is they will continue saving, either through the state-sponsored plans or retirement plans offered by future employers.
While she’s encouraged by the growing interest and adoption of these plans, Antonelli said she hopes to see Congress eventually act by requiring employers to offer retirement plans. A bipartisan group of U.S. House lawmakers reintroduced legislation on the matter in Washington this year, but it has not progressed.
“The goal is to have more states adopt these programs,” she said. “And I think the question is, is there a tipping point at which the federal government will now decide to step in?”

President Donald Trump approved additional emergency federal aid in the wake of repeated floods in Ruidoso, but federal cuts to emergency response and preperation raise uncertainty for state responders.(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)President Donald Trump on Wednesday morning approved a major disaster declaration for New Mexico flood victims, following deadly flash floods in Lincoln County earlier this month.
According to a news release from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the approval makes federal funds available to impacted Lincoln County residents for temporary housing and repairs, and also opens up loans for uninsured property, among other programs. Federal funding also is available to state, tribal and eligible local governments on a cost-sharing basis —with 75% reimbursement — for emergency repairs and replacements of damaged facilities.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham requested the aid in the aftermath of the fatal July 8 flooding that killed three people. The state received partial approval for some aid on July 10, with both the governor and the state’s congressional delegation promising to continue pushing for the major disaster declaration approved on Wednesday.
‘We’re just here to pick up the pieces’: Ruidoso digs out in the aftermath of flooding

“This federal declaration delivers the action we sought for a community that has shown incredible resilience through repeated disasters,” the governor said in a statement. “The people of Lincoln County deserve every resource we can provide, and we will continue working until every family and business in New Mexico has fully recovered.”
State officials are meeting with FEMA and securing documents for additional federal funds for permanent repairs to public infrastructure and for flood damage in Chaves, Otero and Valencia counties from monsoon rains this season, said Danielle Silva, a spokesperson for the New Mexico Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.
Monsoon rains have continued to flood roads and cause power outages in Ruidoso, including Tuesday. While officials reported no water rescues during heavy rains Tuesday, debris sloughing off the burn scars caused a three-foot wave of mud that blocked roads. The Lincoln County emergency manager reported several road closures Tuesday due to water or debris.
The confluence of federal cuts to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and recent deadly flooding disasters in Texas and New Mexico have caused uncertainty for which resources remain available to prepare or respond in the aftermath of extreme weather, occurring more frequently under climate change.
Federal disaster aid is uncertain for states, even as Texas floods underscore need

“There are certain resources the federal government brings to the table that the state just can’t do,” DHSEM State Director Ali Rye told Source NM on Tuesday.
The New Mexico National Guard remains stationed in Ruidoso to address debris removal or further rescue operations, she said, adding that the state was addressing short-term housing for people whose homes the flooding made unlivable.
“The governor has given the direction that we take care of New Mexicans the best way we know how and then we’ll figure out on the back end how we get paid for it, get reimbursed,” Rye said.
Rye noted that while the state is currently “well-positioned” to respond to further disasters, the uncertainty for how FEMA or federal resources will continue to operate could change that picture.
“I don’t know what level of repercussions may roll downhill, but I will say that any impact to federal funding, specifically human funding, will hit us across the board,” she said.
Rye said state emergency officials have pushed for FEMA reform, saying the agency needs to adapt from its establishment 30 years ago.
“It’s very outdated, very cumbersome and burdensome on areas that are trying to recover from the worst days of their lives,” she said. “But we can’t afford for FEMA to go away.”

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)State lawmakers across the country filed more bills to restrict or protect libraries and readers in the first half of this year than last year, a new report found.
The split fell largely along geographic lines, according to the report from EveryLibrary, a group that advocates against book bans and censorship.
Between January and July 2025, lawmakers introduced 133 bills that the organization deemed harmful to libraries, librarians or readers’ rights in 33 states — an increase from 121 bills in all of 2024. Fourteen of those measures had passed as of mid-July.

Iowa legislation
In Iowa, EveryLibrary listed 10 bills — none of which passed — that it considered harmful to libraries. For example, House File 521 would rewrite obscenity laws to remove an exemption for educational institutions and libraries. Another bill, House File 880, would strip state funds from libraries based on their membership in state and national library associations.
— Iowa Capital Dispatch

At the same time, legislators introduced 76 bills in 32 states to protect library services or affirm the right to read, the report found.
The geographic split among these policies is stark.
In Southern and Plains states, new laws increasingly criminalize certain actions of librarians, restrict access to materials about gender and race, and transfer decision-making power to politically appointed boards or parent-led councils.
Texas alone passed a trio of sweeping laws stripping educators of certain legal protections when providing potentially obscene materials; banning public funding for instructional materials containing obscene content; and giving parents more authority over student reading choices and new library additions.
Tennessee lowered the bar to prosecute educators for sharing books that might be considered “harmful to minors.”
A New Hampshire bill likewise would’ve made it easier for parents or the state attorney general to bring civil actions against school employees for distributing material deemed harmful to minors, but it was vetoed by Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte.
In Nebraska, a new law allows for real-time alerts for parents every time a student checks out a book. South Dakota requires libraries and schools to install filtering software. New laws in Idaho heighten the requirements to form library districts and mandate stricter internet filtering policies that are tied to state funding.
In contrast, several Northeastern states have passed legislation protections for libraries and librarians and anti-censorship laws.
New Jersey, Delaware, Rhode Island and Connecticut have each enacted “freedom to read” or other laws that codify protections against ideological censorship in libraries.
Connecticut also took a major step in modernizing libraries in the digital age, the report said, becoming the first state in the nation to pass a law regulating how libraries license and manage e-books and digital audiobooks.

“I am proud of our effort and am grateful for the outpouring of support and encouragement I received from Michiganders across our great state,” Huizenga wrote. “I look forward to announcing my future plans later this year.”

After careful consideration with Natalie and my family, as well as in consultation with President Trump, I have decided against a bid for U.S. Senate in Michigan. I am proud of our effort and am grateful for the outpouring of support and encouragement I received from Michiganders…
— Bill Huizenga (@billhuizenga) July 23, 2025

The decision leaves the race wide open at this point for former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-White Lake), who sought one of Michigan’s U.S. Senate seats last year when it came time to replace the retired former U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow. Rogers lost that 2024 contest to current U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly), even with the full backing of the national and statewide Republican parties and Trump, who endorsed him and propped up Rogers at every turn.
Some questioned whether Rogers, who certainly has a great deal of name recognition in Michigan, was the ideal candidate after his bruising loss to Slotkin. As the only real contender on the Republican side of the race, his recent campaign finance reports showed he was behind his Democratic Party opponents in fundraising, despite his campaign’s insistence otherwise.
Others noted then that Huizenga had raised more in his congressional fundraising efforts than Rogers, and opened the door for him to make a decision on whether to jump in.
On Wednesday, Huizenga backed out, clearing the runway for Rogers’ campaign to take off.
The Republican Senate Leadership Fund, which is backing Rogers early in the cycle, released a statement on Huizenga’s decision, reiterating its support for Rogers.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“There’s no doubt that Mike Rogers is poised to be Michigan’s next U.S. Senator, and Senate Leadership Fund will support his campaign every step of the way,” Alex Latcham, the fund’s executive director, said in a statement. “Leader Thune and Chairman Scott supported Mike Rogers from the beginning and now is the time to unite and let Democrats fight over their First Place Loser.”
Also commenting was the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
“Bill Huizenga has spent this entire year proving to Southwest Michiganders he has zero desire to represent them. From his vote to kick Michiganders off their health care and raise their costs while giving tax cuts to billionaires, to his rubber stamping of reckless tariffs that mean higher prices for families, it’s clear Huizenga works for the special interests and is out-of-step with Southwest Michiganders. Next year Michiganders will elect new leadership who will actually work for them,’ said spokesperson Katie Smith.
With the question of Huizenga’s senatorial interests resolved, the question of whether he will now turn his efforts toward a reelection campaign for his Michigan 4th Congressional District seat remains open.
The last line of Huizenga’s statement, in which he said he would announce his future plans at a later date, left open the possibility that something else might be on the horizon, or that he could possibly eschew retaking his seat altogether.
Huizenga spokesperson Brian Patrick told Michigan Advance that, every two years, the congressman and his wife have a conversation about his future.
“That conversation is coming,” Patrick said. “This is no different than any other term. And we’ll let folks know. … There will be an announcement later this year.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)The University of Louisville is one of five universities the U.S. Department of Education says it’s investigating for discrimination over scholarships for undocumented and underrepresented students. 
The Department of Education specifically named UofL’s Sagar Patagundi Scholarship that is intended to “subsidize the cost of higher education…for undergraduate DACA and undocumented students.” 
The department’s Office for Civil Rights investigation “will determine whether these universities are granting scholarships only for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) or ‘undocumented’ students,” according to a Wednesday news release. 
John Karman, a spokesman for UofL, said the university was “just notified of this investigation yesterday” and “we are reviewing the claims.”

The University of Nebraska Omaha, University of Miami, the University of Michigan and Western Michigan University are also being investigated. 
Craig Trainor, the acting assistant secretary for Civil Rights and an appointee of President Donald Trump, said the investigation is in line with Trump’s wishes to “put America first.” 
“We are expanding our enforcement efforts to protect American students and lawful residents from invidious national origin discrimination of the kind alleged here,” Trainor said in a statement. 
The Department of Education said it received complaints from the conservative organization Legal Insurrection Foundation’s Equal Protection Project about these scholarships. The investigation will also  look into: 

University of Nebraska Omaha’s Dreamer’s Pathway Scholarship for “students who are DACA or DACA-eligible and Nebraska residents who are seeking an undergraduate degree.” 
University of Miami’s U Dreamers Program, which “is available to academically talented and admissible [DACA] and undocumented high school seniors and transfer students.” 
University of Michigan’s Dreamer Scholarship, which “is intended to support undocumented students or students with DACA status.” 
Western Michigan University’s WMU Undocumented/DACA Scholarship “for undergraduate students who are ineligible to receive federal student aid due to an undocumented or DACA status.” 
University of Louisville’s Dawn Wilson Scholarship for “undergraduate LGBTQ+ students of color” and the Louisville Tango Festival Scholarship for “Latino/a/x and Hispanic students.” 
University of Nebraska Omaha’s HDR Scholarship, which gives “preference…to underrepresented minority students.” 
Western Michigan University’s Elissa Gatlin Endowed Scholarship for “African American, Native American or Hispanic American” students.

(Sophie Nieto-Munoz for New Jersey Monitor)The New Jersey Supreme Court said the state attorney general can retain control of the Paterson Police Department, dismissing claims from city officials who said the state takeover was unlawful.
The unanimous ruling, written by Justice Anne M. Patterson, reverses an appellate court’s decision that found in the city officials’ favor. While the opinion stops short of granting broad authority to the attorney general to supersede municipal police departments, the ruling says the Legislature gave the necessary green light for the takeover in Paterson.
“The Legislature did not question, much less invalidate, the supersession here; to the contrary, it expressly acknowledged that the Attorney General had superseded control of the Department and took affirmative steps to ensure that the (officer in charge) would succeed in his crucial role in that supersession,” the 30-page opinion says.
Attorney General Matthew Platkin took over the day-to-day operations of Paterson’s police in March 2023, weeks after officers shot and killed Najee Seabrooks, a violence intervention specialist whose family said was suffering from a mental health episode at the time of his killing. Police say Seabrooks came at them with a knife.
In the days following Seabrooks’ death, community activists demanded police reform, particularly in how law enforcement responds to mental health emergencies.
Platkin’s takeover included removing the police chief and appointing former New York Police Department official Isa Abbassi as the officer-in-charge (Abbassi has since stepped down and was replaced by Patrick Murray, who was a city police officer for nearly 40 years).
In a statement, Platkin touted his office’s “extraordinary progress” in making Paterson safer in the two years since the takeover — “despite the distractions of this litigation.” He pointed to a drop in shooting incidents, the seizure of hundreds of illegal ATVs, and the creation of a task force to prevent illegal clubs and violent crime spillover. 
“Thanks to the Court’s definitive ruling this morning, that important work will continue undisturbed, ensuring that we can better serve the residents of our State’s third largest city — whose safety has been and will remain my top priority,” he said.
Paterson Mayor Andre Sayegh and city officials challenged the state takeover in two separate complaints that were transferred to the appellate division, which found Platkin had no statutory authority for the takeover. The case was then appealed to the Supreme Court.
Wednesday’s ruling cites two laws enacted by the Legislature — Chapter 94, a narrowly-tailored measure that allows officers who haven’t met training requirements to serve as chief of a city like Paterson, and the 2024 budget bill that allocated $10 million to support the attorney general’s efforts in the city. The court said it viewed those actions as support for the supersession to proceed.
But the judges stressed that this case is a “one-time alignment” of executive action and legislative endorsement. The ruling leaves open the potential for future legal battles over state and local police control if the attorney general attempts a similar takeover without legislative backing.
“This appeal raises significant questions about the Attorney General’s claim that he ‘may supersede and take control of an entire law enforcement agency’ whenever he determines that step to be appropriate. The Legislature has the authority to address those questions directly and clarify its intent and expectations, should it decide to do so,” the opinion states. 
Paterson’s police has been plagued by numerous scandals in recent years, including an FBI investigation into suspected corruption and community protests over excessive force used by police.

(Zac Jebbia | Courtesy photo)The federal government has approved West Virginia’s request for a disaster declaration related to flash flooding that killed nine people and displaced others in the northern part of the state last month.
President Donald Trump announced the disaster declaration Tuesday evening on the social media platform Truth Social, saying that he had granted the state $11.7 million for severe flooding and tornadoes that happened in June. 
“I just finished speaking with their wonderful Governor, Patrick Morrisey, and look forward to seeing the State make a full recovery. I love West Virginia!” he wrote. 
Morrisey announced Tuesday that individual assistance has been approved for Marion and Ohio counties, which occurred after heavy rains that started June 14. The flooding killed nine people in Ohio County. It also destroyed an apartment building in Fairmont, displacing its residents. 
“President Trump and his administration has shown once again that they will step up and support West Virginia,” Morrisey said in the news release. “I want to thank everyone involved in securing Individual Assistance for Ohio and Marion counties and providing us another tool to help these communities make a full recovery.”
Morrisey formally requested the disaster declaration on June 20. One month after the floods, state Democrats criticized the Trump administration, demanding answers about why it had not yet approved the disaster declaration. 
In a joint statement, West Virginia’s congressional delegation — Reps. Riley Moore, R-W.Va., and Carol Miller, R-W.Va, and Sens. Jim Justice, R-W.Va., and Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., — applauded the declaration and said they were grateful for it to the Trump administration. They had previously written a letter to Trump and to the Federal Emergency Management Agency in support of the state getting such a declaration.
“The flooding that occurred saw devastating loss of life and property, and we are glad that much-needed help is on the way to help these communities recover and rebuild,” they wrote in the statement. “We commend the bravery of the first responders who sprang into action and the local leaders, churches, and charities who have been on the ground helping victims begin to rebuild their lives.”
The declaration means that homeowners and residents in those counties who suffered loss and damage in the flash floods are eligible for individual assistance, including emergency repairs to homes, private bridges, private roads, temporary housing, transportation, moving and storage, funeral expenses, uninsured and underinsured personal property losses, as well as expenses for medical, dental, legal and child care services.
Residents should first file claims with their insurance providers and then file for assistance from FEMA in one of the following ways:

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-23 16:22:01+00:00,CT Mirror,How federal policy changes will affect Access Health CT plans,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/23/access-health-ct-federal-policy-big-beautiful-bill/,"Recent federal policy changes, including the 'Big Beautiful Bill,' will impact people who purchase health insurance through CT's exchange.","Connecticut’s Democratic elected officials have been crisscrossing the state to warn about the impacts of Medicaid cuts in President Donald J. Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill.” The measure, along with other federal policy changes, will also impact people who purchase plans through state-based exchanges established by the Affordable Care Act. These plans are often referred to as “qualified health plans,” “marketplace plans” or “ACA plans.”
Roughly 150,000 residents purchase health insurance through Access Health CT, the state’s health insurance exchange. Many of the cuts to the exchange plans will happen before the widely-discussed changes to Medicaid, with some changes to the ACA plans going into effect as soon as this year.
Here’s what you need to know about those upcoming changes.
Enhanced premium tax credits
Around 90% of Connecticut residents who purchase a plan on the exchange receive financial support to help cover the cost. At the end of 2025, one type of subsidy, known as “enhanced premium tax credits,” is set to expire. As a result, Connecticut residents with exchange plans could expect to pay $1,700 more on average every year for their health insurance, according to Access Health CT. Over 135,000 people will lose at least some financial support. A fifth of those people, or roughly 27,000, will no longer be eligible for any financial assistance.
The federal government originally passed the “enhanced” premium tax credits in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act and extended them through the end of 2025 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. The Affordable Care Act already provided financial assistance to people with qualifying incomes who purchased exchange plans. The enhanced subsidies in ARPA and the IRA were meant to give more financial support during COVID-19 to people who already received it, as well as provide some to people who made a bit too much to qualify for subsidies under the ACA.
Unless Congress extends the enhanced subsidies before the end of the year, they will expire on Dec. 31. People who make over 400% of the federal poverty level annually and qualify for enhanced subsidies based on their income and household size will no longer receive financial support. People who make less than 400% of the federal poverty level will still receive financial support, but it will be reduced. In 2025, 400% of the federal poverty level for a family of four equates to an annual income of roughly $127,000.
The expiration of the enhanced subsidies will also deal a major blow to Covered Connecticut, a program that provides no-cost exchange plans to residents who make too much to qualify for Medicaid but still earn 175% or less than the federal poverty level. Covered Connecticut currently provides more than 40,000 residents with no-cost health and dental coverage. The Department of Social Services estimates it would cost the state $30 million annually to continue the program.
State budget officials recently projected last fiscal year’s spending plan closed out with an almost $2.2 billion surplus.
A spokesperson for DSS said the agency is awaiting more guidance from federal agencies before reviewing the information with Gov. Ned Lamont. Once “he has decided on a course of action, the administration will discuss next steps with legislators and other relevant stakeholders. Any changes to revenue or appropriations resulting from the Trump budget will require legislative approval.”
Coverage for immigrants 
Federal policy changes will also impact access to exchange plans for people with certain immigration status, with some measures going into effect almost immediately.
Beginning in August 2025, recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, will no longer be eligible to enroll in health coverage through the exchange. The federal policy allowing them to access ACA plans only went into effect in November 2024 and was overturned by a “final rule” issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, in June. Less than 200 Connecticut residents will be impacted by this change, according to Access Health CT.
As a result of the “big beautiful bill,” green card holders who can’t qualify for Medicaid because they haven’t been residents for a minimum of five years will no longer receive tax credits that allow them to purchase discounted plans on the exchange. This change will go into effect in January 2026 and will impact roughly 4,855 enrollees in Connecticut, according to data provided by Access Health CT to the comptroller’s office.
Effective January 2027, financial assistance will only be available to certain types of immigrants, including legal permanent residents, as well as people who entered the U.S. through the Cuban-Haitian Entrant Program. Roughly 11,000 residents, including refugees, asylees, trafficking survivors and humanitarian parolees will no longer qualify for financial assistance. 
Changes to enrollment and income verification timelines
There are also pending administrative changes. 
Generally, people can only enroll in an exchange plan between Nov. 1 and mid-December, but a “special enrollment period” allows people with incomes at or below 150% of the federal poverty level to enroll in any month. The special enrollment period provision will be eliminated on Aug. 25 of this year.
Also beginning Aug. 25, CMS will be changing the ways in which people must verify their incomes for financial help, including shortening the time period to submit documents from 150 days to 90 days.

The U.S. Department of Education on Wednesday announced investigations into five universities across the U.S. – including two in Michigan – following complaints that the schools violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by offering “unlawful exclusionary funding based on national origin.”
The University of Michigan and Western Michigan University are both subject to an investigation the department says will determine whether they are providing scholarships only for students with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival status, or who are undocumented following complaints submitted to the department’s Office of Civil Rights by the Legal Insurrection Foundation, a conservative advocacy group. 
According to a statement from the department, the University of Michigan’s Dreamer Scholarship, which “is intended to support undocumented students or students with DACA status”, will be looked into, as well as Western Michigan University’s WMU Undocumented/DACA Scholarship “for undergraduate students who are ineligible to receive federal student aid due to an undocumented or DACA status.” The complaints argue these scholarships “provide unlawful exclusionary funding based on national origin.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The Office of Civil Rights also announced it would investigate Western Michigan University’s Elissa Gatlin Endowed Scholarship for “African American, Native American, or Hispanic American” students. 
“On January 21, 2025, President Trump promised that ‘every single day of the Trump Administration, [he] will, very simply, put America first.’ Neither the Trump Administration’s America first policies nor the Civil Right[s] Act of 1964’s prohibition on national origin discrimination permit universities to deny our fellow citizens the opportunity to compete for scholarships because they were born in the United States,” Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor said in a statement. “As we mark President Trump’s historic six months back in the White House, we are expanding our enforcement efforts to protect American students and lawful residents from invidious national origin discrimination of the kind alleged here.”
This latest action comes amid efforts by President Donald Trump and his administration to dramatically redefine the federal government’s role in education. His administration has pushed for sweeping changes, including an executive order directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to oversee the shutdown of her own department, deep staffing cuts affecting over 1,300 agency employees, threats to withhold funding from schools that implement diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, and an aggressive campaign against so-called “woke” policies in higher education.
Alongside the University of Michigan and Western Michigan University, the University of Louisville, the University of Nebraska Omaha and the University of Miami are also under investigation for scholarships benefitting undocumented students and students with DACA status. 
In an emailed statement, Kay Jarvis, director of public affairs for the University of Michigan said the college had received a letter of notification regarding the investigation and had no further comment. 
Western Michigan’s Vice President for Marketing and Strategic Communications Tony Proudfoot has yet to respond to a request for comment.

(Photo: NCGA video) Earlier this year, after the state Supreme Court effectively okayed the egregious action of Republican legislators stripping the Governor’s power to appoint members to the State Board of Elections and handing it to the newly elected GOP state Auditor, Justice Anita Earls powerfully and eloquently dissented, saying, in part:
“If the voters of North Carolina wanted a Republican official to control the State Board of Elections, they could have elected a Republican Governor. If they wanted David Boliek [the Auditor] in particular to run our elections, they could have elected him the Governor. The voters did not. The General Assembly may not grab power over enforcement of election laws by shuttling the Board between statewide elected officials until it finds one willing to do its bidding.”
We can now prepare, Earls continued, for the Agriculture Commissioner to “represent the State in criminal appeals, the Attorney General supervise the State Health Plan, and the Treasurer to run the State Fair.”
She might have added that a similar anti-democratic power was previously rejected by North Carolina voters. When an amendment removing election board appointment authority from the Governor was presented to the voters in 2018 in a constitutional amendment ballot initiative, they soundly rejected it, by a margin of 61.6% to 38.4%. In a purple state like North Carolina this was a overwhelming landslide and a decisive outcome. The people had spoken, loud and clear.
But it has become the central tenet of the North Carolina GOP under Senator Phil Berger’s leadership that he and his pals know better than the people and are more than willing to shove their agenda down our throats whether we like it or not. Not only do Republican leaders continue to put power over principles, they seem poised to keep driving forward with their right-wing authoritarian plans until they are stopped.
And that brings us to Dave Boliek, our newly elected, extreme MAGA partisan State Auditor. This office, maybe more than any office on the Council of State, is designed to fulfill a nonpartisan role. Obviously, Boliek ran as a Republican – just as the incumbent he defeated, Jessica Holmes, ran as a Democrat. Like all elected officials, he’s entitled to his beliefs and partisan tendencies and preferences and to run a campaign. But it’s also true that the duties of the State Auditor — the state’s top accountant – are overwhelmingly nonpartisan and that once in office, he needed to leave all the partisan nonsense at the door.
Interestingly, Boliek spoke a good game on the campaign trail about how he was going to bring integrity and fairness to this office if elected. But in a fashion that’s become disturbingly typical for North Carolina Republicans, he said what he needed to say to get elected and then as soon as he was, he quickly thumbed his nose at every voter that is not part of the MAGA base.
Boliek made clear just how thoroughly partisan of an actor he would be just four weeks after the election when he said, “I pledge to be that guy that stands between Josh Stein, Jeff Jackson, and Rachel Hunt doing what they want to do without answering to accountability. That will be my job as your state auditor. I pledge to do that each and every day.” As you can see, he only mentions keeping Democrats accountable and not Republicans, which is the exact opposite of how a State Auditor should approach their duties.
The moment at which Boliek could have really stepped up and acted as a true leader for the entire state was when GOP lawmakers gave him the power to make appointments to the State Board of Elections. It was obvious to anyone with two eyes and a brain that what the General Assembly was doing was corrupt as heck when it effected the power switch during a lame duck session after the 2024 election.
I know it probably sounds laughable in today’s political climate for a leader to make a stand for the integrity of our system over raw political power, but Boliek could have made just such a stand by appointing a truly nonpartisan board. Instead, however, he happily spit in the face of all voters who elected Governor Stein to have this power by choosing extreme partisans.
At my organization, Veterans for Responsible Leadership, we strive to help get people into public office that want to put their integrity and their duty to the constitution above all else. This is for the good of the country and the health of our democracy. Dave Boliek has clearly failed this test miserably and our state is worse off because of it.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Boliek-6172025.jpg,,,2025-07-23 11:59:44.837194

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Regulators questioned Evergy officials Monday about its rate case, honing in on why the company was willing to accept a $69 million decrease from its initial request.
Evergy had asked the Kansas Corporation Commission for a $197 million base rate increase. Instead, after hours of negotiations with KCC staff, attorneys for industrial consumers, the Citizens’ Utility Ratepayer Board and others, they agreed to a $128 million increase.
The unanimous settlement agreement increases residential base rates by 9.6%, which will bump an average homeowner’s bill by about $9 per month.
Darrin Ives, Evergy vice president for regulatory affairs, said much of the difference in the two amounts is attributed to a lower return on equity and changes to capital structure. Capital structure affects how the utility finances and manages its operations.
Evergy asked for a 10.5% return on equity for investors and settled at 9.7%, Ives said, calling it a “significant move.” Evergy ROE currently is set at 9.4% by the commission.
“It may be a little bit low from our view of a peer utility perspective, but it certainly is within the range of reasonableness and within a range that we feel comfortable that we can tell our investors that Kansas is supportive of continued investment and continued economic development in the state,” he said.
Ives said the settlement agreement was “moderate to slightly below average” compared to peer states and utilities.
Other Midwest utilities, such as Ameren and Xcel Energy, reported return on equities of more than 10%, according to data on Macrotrends.

Panasonic’s new $4 billion battery plant in De Soto is a new customer on Evergy’s grid that has the potential to bring in large revenue increases over time. In the settlement agreement, Evergy and KCC staff had opposing views on how to share those revenues between investors and ratepayers, Ives said.
Commissioner Dwight Keen asked Ives to explain his willingness to agree to a completely different outcome than Ives expressed in prefiled testimony.
The issue was whether the company would keep 100% of the Panasonic revenue increases between rate cases. Ives said he felt that should be the case, as Evergy is responsible for all costs between cases.
Staff took the opposite viewpoint, and parties to the settlement agreement compromised. If Evergy, between this current rate case and the next, reached the 9.7% ROE, then 50% of Panasonic’s revenue would be shared back to consumers.
Keen noted that ensuring fairness between investors and ratepayers is important work of KCC.
“The balancing proposition we have is between making sure that the monopolies, the utilities, we regulate can derive a fair rate of return, on the one hand,” he said. “We have to balance that against the affordability to the ratepayers.”
 
Panasonic production
Commissioner Andrew French questioned Ives “out of curiosity” about media reports that Panasonic would not achieve full production on its original schedule. He said a Bloomberg interview with Panasonic North American president Megan Myungwon Lee indicated that was misinformation and that the plant would be at full production by the end of the year.
Panasonic spokeswoman Alison Klooster, responding to a Kansas Reflector inquiry, said in an email the company would not be at full production by the end of the year.
“Megan Lee was referring to De Soto getting to the point of full mass production this year, meaning that the lines that are currently operational will reach that point of full mass production,” Klooster said. “She was not referring to the current maximum planned production capacity of the entire facility.”
In response to questions whether the company still planned to meet its full production capacity by the original date of spring 2027, she said the company is excited to have begun production. 
“It has always been our plan to grow our North American business in a sustainable manner within the market,” she said. “We have seen 11% growth in U.S. electric vehicle sales in Q1 this year compared with last year, and we are carefully assessing demand trends to expand production capacity while responding to the needs and requests of our customers.
KCC will make a decision on the rate case by Sept. 29.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/dwight-keen-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-07-23 11:59:44.837194

The Wilmington VA Medical Center is taking part in a nationwide initiative to tackle veteran homelessness with a large-scale outreach event targeting New Castle County on Wednesday, July 23, 2025.
“The VA recognizes how important it is to go beyond traditional ways of outreach to meet the needs of our unsheltered Veterans as effectively as possible, said Lisa Lincoln, Wilmington VA Homeless Outreach Coordinator.
The event is part of the Department of Veterans Affairs’ “Getting Veterans Off the Streets” initiative, launched May 1, which requires every VA medical center in the country to conduct a local outreach operation known as a SURGE event.
The goal: connect homeless veterans with immediate shelter and support services.

Wilmington’s effort comes as Delaware continues to face a growing homelessness crisis.
In 2024, more than 1,300 people in the state were identified as experiencing homelessness.
The VA Homeless Program at the Wilmington center will coordinate five outreach teams, operating from a central command center.
These teams will include staff from VA outreach services and several community organizations: Warriors Helping Warriors, Delaware Center for Homeless Veterans, Veterans Multi-Service Center, Home of the Brave, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the Housing Alliance of Delaware.
Teams will be deployed across Wilmington and surrounding areas, seeking out unsheltered individuals — both veterans and non-veterans — with a focus on identifying and assisting veterans. Those who accept help will be transported to shelters or temporary housing the same day.
“We will continue to serve and support our Veterans who gave so much for us,” said Wilmington VA Director Vamsee Potluri. “We plan to continue this initiative throughout Delaware and southern New Jersey.”
The outreach reflects a growing emphasis by the VA on direct, on-the-ground efforts to reach homeless veterans where they are — and get them into safe housing quickly.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-23-at-10.56.48-AM.png,,,2025-07-23 11:59:44.837194

""Opportunity Zones” – now a permanent policy – offered major breaks to investors who pursued projects in low-income communities.  But in Massachusetts and across the country, whether the program delivered much on its promise is still up for debate – a question made even harder to answer by the lack of solid data on projects it has aided.  
The post The enig[...]","THE DAYS SINCE President Trump signed the massive tax and spending bill have seen an avalanche of stories about its cuts to programs aimed at supporting low-income Americans – food stamps, Medicaid, and educational aid, to name a few. Buried in the bill, however, was a provision that builds on one of the few initiatives of Trump’s first term that was aimed at lifting up poor communities.  
“Opportunity Zones” offered major breaks to investors who pursued projects in low-income communities. The new tax and spending bill makes permanent those opportunity zone tax breaks, which were due to sunset next year. But in Massachusetts and across the country, whether the program delivered much on its promise is still up for debate – a question made even harder to answer by the lack of solid data on projects it has aided.  
Under the initial bipartisan Opportunity Zone legislation, in exchange for investing funds to boost projects in low-income census tracts, investors could postpone or reduce taxes on their capital gains or, if they held onto the investment property for at least a decade, not have to pay taxes on those gains at all.  
After the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December 2017, states across the country jumped at the chance to bring investment interest to their poorest census tracts. State officials were tasked with submitting potential Opportunity Zones to the federal government, limited to 25 percent of their state’s eligible tracts. To be eligible, a census tract had to have median income below a certain threshold or, in some cases, be next door to one than did.   
“We looked at it as an opportunity to direct more investment into communities that were in need of that investment,” said Jay Ash, the housing and economic development chief during Gov. Charlie Baker’s administration at the time. “We prioritized and spent a lot of time on it around the state.”  
Concerns also soon appeared that the policy might provide a tax windfall for deep-pocketed investors on projects that they would have pursued anyway, but not do much to improve communities.   
The state, however, energetically took up the role of middleman between interested communities and the feds. The state housing and economic development office set up a system to deal with the “robust competition” for a limited number of Opportunity Zones spots, Ash said, inviting communities to submit census tract applications, and developing a matrix for deciding the best fits.   
Ash said US Sen. Tim Scott, a Republican co-sponsor of the original legislation, even called the governor to compliment Massachusetts on its approach.  
In 2018, the US Department of the Treasury designated 8,764 census tracts as qualified Opportunity Zones. As Bay State cities and towns scrambled to have their census tracts qualified, certain zones being ignored sparked some local dust-ups. Attorney General Andrea Campbell, at the time a Boston city councilor, complained that the district she represented had been left  out.   
The state landed on 138 Opportunity Zones in Massachusetts, located in 79 communities. So did anything come from them? 
“I don’t know,” Ash said.

DATA DEFICIT  
That uncertainty stems largely from the difficulty tracking the record of Opportunity Zone projects.  
Communities, landowners, and investors can file directly with the federal government to access the tax benefit, leaving the state without a reliable way to know which groups used the tax credit or its results. Plus, most project backers don’t broadcast their financing structures. 
In his current role, as president and CEO of the business-backed Massachusetts Competitive Partnership, Ash has tried, without success, to get localized data on the success of the program from the federal government as well as from the Washington-based think tank, the Economic Innovation Group, credited with advancing the model.  
“I went to conferences and asked people to tell me more, and I can’t tell you with any certainty what projects in Massachusetts have been advanced with Opportunity Zone money,” said Ash.  
A flurry of excitement in the years between the 2017 legislation passing and the start of the Covid-19 pandemic involved state conferences dedicated to Opportunity Zone promotion, workshops from smart growth groups touting the tool, some initial burbles of investor interest, and wholehearted embrace from eager municipalities.  
Cities like Fitchburg rolled out prospectuses specifically on how best to attract Opportunity Zone development.  
SmartGrowth America, a national advocacy group, highlighted Salem in 2020 as an interesting prospect for its Opportunity Zones near the commuter rail station. “The first time it came through, Salem was trying to let developers know about it,” said Amanda Chiancola, the city’s deputy director of planning and community development. “We try to use every tool available to us.”   
To her knowledge, however, “nothing in Salem happened,” Chiancola said. “We would love it if it had.” 
The smart growth group also pointed to potential in Greenfield and Montague, highlighting the upside of bringing local governments and developers together by pointing to a seeming success story: Toward the end of an Opportunity Zones-focused conference, the town of Montague accepted a proposal from a local developer in attendance for a mixed-use development on a long-vacant site.  
But that project, which had struggled to bring in private funding and had fallen through several times, evaporated again, said Chris Nolan-Zeller, Montague’s assistant town administrator. After about 20 years of the site sitting vacant, he said, the town “decided to move on” and pursue turning it into a library with public money instead.  
While parts of the once-bustling mill town in Western Massachusetts are seeing revitalization, particularly around the arts and tourism, Nolan-Zeller said there are challenges and hurdles in attracting private investment for rural communities. Montague approached the zones with enthusiasm in 2018, he said, only to be disappointed by what transpired.   
“We’d love a private developer to come in,” he said, to clean up the dilapidated mill sites and reduce hazards. “Locally, there’s not much hope. Public investment is the most reliable thing to strive for,” he said, citing a $10 million federal grant the town received to help transform former mill sites into a park. 
For Ted Carman, president of the Concord Square Planning and Development Group, the Opportunity Zones have been a project-saver in areas deeply in need of new housing to ease the state-wide crunch. 
He says three Brockton housing projects his company developed turned on being able to pitch investors on the tax incentives. One looking to transform a vacant building into 55 apartment units was already in progress for two years before the program took hold, but Carman said the financing finally locked in after the OZ change.  
The next two, he said, needed to be in Opportunity Zones from the jump. He said he worked with the City of Brockton to redraw the zone around a current project site to put the tax incentive on the table. 
The objection that “‘investors are making a lot of money on this’ is the wrong way to look at it,” Carman said. “This program is pulling millions of dollars into projects that otherwise would not get them. It’s been a terrific program for these communities.”  
Of the 138 Massachusetts census tracts to become qualified Opportunity Zones, 18 percent are rural and 48 percent are in Gateway Cities. 
The Economic Innovation Group asserts that early results from the first batch of Opportunity Zones, which they released as the new tax bill came through, “largely validated the policy’s fundamental design.” Through the end of 2022, the group wrote, $89 billion in qualifying Opportunity Zones equity investments had been made across over 5,600 low-income neighborhoods.   
Other studies of the policy said the initiative had mixed results.  
A 2022 review of the program, based on tax filings, by the US Treasury’s Office of Tax Analysis found little data to support the conclusion that employment rates, start-up investments, new businesses, new business loan growth, or commercial investment are positively affected by OZ designation.   
Beyond that, zones “that had a higher median household income, higher measures of educational attainment, higher house prices, and lower unemployment were more likely to receive investment,” the review found. Those areas also broadly saw a drop in poverty rates and unemployment – plus experienced stronger increases in educational attainment, income, and housing values – in the five years before the policy took effect than zones that did not receive investments. 
In other words, investors across the country are putting their money into areas on the upswing but still considered low-income, while largely skipping over communities that seem to be economically stagnant.  
Whether the program spurred new projects was also a toss-up, wrote authors of a 2020 Urban Institute study. “The OZ incentives have had mixed effects in terms of making projects work that would not otherwise happen,” it said. “Some developers reported that the incentives did make a decisive difference in allowing a project to go forward, while others were clear that their project would have proceeded with or without OZ equity.”    
ZONE UPDATES 
The new law, which takes effect after the current policy expires at the end of 2026, does include adjustments responding to complaints about too much focus on urban areas, transparency, and community impact.  
One much-maligned aspect of the first Opportunity Zone policy turned on more well-off districts receiving funding because they were adjacent to a low-income tract. That provision has been removed in the new law. Meanwhile, the standards for income levels have been tightened so that the tracts generally can only qualify if median family income does not exceed 70 percent (rather than the prior 80 percent) of the applicable state or metropolitan area median family income.   
The program will also now offer more generous tax benefits for investors if the zone receiving investment is entirely within a rural area. All Opportunity Zone funds would also face stricter tax and investor reporting requirements on projects funded and their operations, though there is no regulation in place that would make those reports publicly available or accessible to lawmakers.  
Unlike the first round, there is no sunset to the new law. Governors will propose new census tracts for their state each decade, and the certified tracts will be considered qualified Opportunity Zones for another 10 years.  
Gov. Maura Healey’s administration, asked about the success of the law in Massachusetts, responded only that the state had a limited role in the selection process and no access to the federal data to determine whether the program was effective. As for whether the state would encourage cities and towns to participate in the future, “we are currently reviewing recent federal legislation regarding changes to the Opportunity Zones program,” the state Economic Development office said in a comment to CommonWealth Beacon this week.  
At its core, Opportunity Zone policy remains focused on a narrow pitch – make it easy and profitable for private investment to boost low-income areas. But for municipalities that have not already started becoming more attractive to investors, capital could flow past them toward the easier prospects.   
“I am confident that we created the environment in which an investor and community could mutually benefit from the Opportunity Zones,” Ash said. “But until I see what the benefits of the first rounds of Opportunity Zone funding was, I can’t testify as to their efficacy.”
