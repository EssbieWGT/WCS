We cannot sustain world-class institutions if we squeeze workers and residents who make them run. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Narain Batra: Growth is pushing the Upper Valley to breaking point.","This commentary is by Narain Batra, a professor, historian, journalist and author whose work spans freedom, artificial intelligence, media and geopolitics. 



The Upper Valley, a most extraordinary economic and cultural heartbeat of the vast twin-state region, is currently at a turning point where outstanding institutional growth is colliding with a bucolic infrastructure that’s pushing against its limits and raising the question of affordability.
The colossal footprint of Dartmouth Health remains the region’s major economic driver. The final phases of the Patient Pavilion at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC) are scheduled for completion in August 2026, adding new inpatient beds and specialized units, according to Tom Manion, DHMC’s chief operating officer. 
But its expansion is reaching a critical threshold, and the so-called Upper Valley paradox — it is building beds for patients but lacks roofs for staff — is evident. 
Dartmouth College is doing its part to mitigate the housing crunch through its Sugarwood Circle project in West Lebanon, a $15.2 million development specifically for Dartmouth employees.
It is slated for initial occupancy in January 2026, as part of President Sian Leah Beilock’s commitment to add 1,000 beds for faculty, staff, and students in the next 10 years.
Keeping affordability expectations in mind, the “company town” model could perhaps become a primary survival strategy for major employers in the Upper Valley: most of the stores, businesses, and housing in the town would be partially or fully owned by the same company that is also the main employer. 
Consider this: as of late 2025, the median home price in Grafton County surged 12.4%, almost triple the statewide average, according to the Fiscal Policy Institute. 
Lawmakers in both Concord and Montpelier are facing rebellion from business leaders who argue that 1970s-era regulations are strangling growth. 
The Vermont Chamber’s 2026 Legislative Priorities emphasize “workforce and housing alignment” and the need for regulatory predictability.
According to the Vermont Chamber of Commerce, “Affordability pressures, demographic decline, and rising operating costs are converging just as our state needs more workers, more housing, and greater predictability to sustain economic growth.” 
For Upper Valley residents, 2026 will raise questions about zoning laws and whether they can combine new housing opportunities with environmental preservation. The question is no longer if the region must change, but how fast it can adapt its legal framework to keep pace with its economic potential. 
The most disquieting question of 2026 is what might be termed the property tax shock. As towns upgrade infrastructure to support growth, sooner or later, the bill will arrive. 
Vermont homeowners are facing a projected average 12% education property tax increase in 2026, driven by rising school costs. For the average homeowner in the Upper Valley, rising home valuations are no longer viewed as a wealth gain but a liability. 
Property tax bills jump while the local school district is still forced to cut staff, which, to residents like me, seems a cruel joke.
The Upper Valley’s labor crisis has been worsened by federal policy. Deportations and intensified Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, such as the recent high-profile actions against farmworkers in the Champlain Valley and Upper Valley dairy farms, have created a chilling effect that extends far beyond the undocumented community. 
Dairy farmers in the region, who are largely ineligible for the H-2A seasonal visa program, are facing serious threats. According to the Business & Human Rights Centre, many workers are now afraid to leave the farms to get basic necessities. The loss of even a few key milkers can force a multigeneration family farm to close down.
In New Hampshire, the landscape shifted drastically on Jan. 1 as new anti-sanctuary laws took full effect. Communities like Lebanon and Hanover have been forced to amend their ordinances to allow police cooperation with ICE or face state penalties of up to 25% of their funding.
With deaths now outnumbering births in the region, growth is almost entirely predicated on migration. International migrants fill a disproportionate share of essential roles in health care, manufacturing and domestic services, according to USA Facts. 
The Upper Valley in 2026 is a microcosm of the modern American dilemma: high-tech and high-demand, but low inventory in housing and labor. 
It’s a region with a “We Are Hiring” sign permanently affixed to its front door, finally realizing it cannot sustain its world class institutions if it continues to squeeze the workers and residents who make them run.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The U.S. Justice Department has issued subpoenas to Gov. Tim Walz and Mayor Jacob Frey as part of a criminal investigation into whether they’ve impeded federal immigration enforcement, the Washington Post reported Friday.
The investigation intensifies an already combustible conflict between the feds and Minnesota, while also adding to the DOJ’s list of targets deemed enemies by President Donald Trump and his administration. 
A DOJ spokesperson declined comment. 
Walz’s office said he hadn’t received any notice of investigation. 
Walz replied in a statement to the news: “Two days ago it was Elissa Slotkin. Last week it was Jerome Powell. Before that, Mark Kelly,” he said, referring to the U.S. senators who made a video telling U.S. servicemembers that they can and must refuse illegal orders, as well as the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who has refused to lower interest rates as quickly as Trump desires. “Weaponizing the justice system and threatening political opponents is a dangerous, authoritarian tactic,” Walz said. 
Frey called the investigation “an obvious attempt to intimidate me for standing up for Minneapolis, our local law enforcement and our residents against the chaos and danger this administration has brought to our streets.” 
He added: “I will not be intimidated.” 
The Post reported that “the subpoenas suggest that the Justice Department is examining whether Walz’s and Frey’s public statements disparaging the surge of officers and federal actions have amounted to criminal interference in law enforcement work.”
Walz, who announced earlier this month he won’t seek a third term, also used his statement to criticize the federal government for not properly investigating the killing of Renee Good by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross. “The only person not being investigated for the shooting of Renee Good is the federal agent who shot her,” he said.   
Six prosecutors in the Minnesota Office of U.S. Attorney quit this week, The New York Times reported, because they objected to their bosses’ push to investigate the widow of Good and their ties to anti-ICE groups. 
The ICE surge, which has put as many as 3,000 federal agents in the state — or nearly five times the number of sworn officers with the Minneapolis Police Department — is just the latest round of an ongoing conflict between Minnesota and the federal government. Fraud in Minnesota’s social programs — often funded in whole or part by the federal government — has caught the attention of right-wing media and activists, and the Trump administration has followed with a wide array of investigations of Minnesota programs across a range of agencies.  
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is auditing Hennepin Healthcare — Minnesota’s largest safety net hospital — for compliance with immigrant employment eligibility laws.
The Trump administration has frozen child care payments and halted small business grants. The administration also says it’s investigating possible housing assistance fraud and looking into Minnesota’s unemployment insurance program. The federal government has also attempted to withhold funds to Minnesota for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, but a federal court issued a preliminary injunction.
Earlier this week, Trump said he would cut all federal funding to Minnesota and other states that have sanctuary cities beginning Feb. 1, but it’s unclear what that means and few details have been released.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MG_9332-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 20:57:41.157388

(Photo by Jeremy Edwards/Federal Emergency Management Agency)Landslides, storm-driven floods, infrastructure-damaging permafrost thaw and intensifying wildfires are among the expensive disasters that scientists link to Alaska’s rapidly changing climate.
Now a state legislator is proposing to levy a 20-cent surcharge on every barrel of Alaska-produced oil to fund programs that respond to and prepare for disasters related to climate change.
Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage, introduced the measure, House Bill 247, in advance of the legislative session scheduled to start on Jan. 20.
To explain why the state needs such a fund, Josephson ticked off a list of recent disasters in Alaska that imposed heavy costs — and, in some cases, killed people. Those events, which include deadly landslides in Southeast Alaska, landslides that have blocked roads, severe flooding in Western Alaska last October from the remnants of Typhoon Halong and similar damage in 2022 from the remnants of Typhoon Merbok, all had some links to climate change that is caused by greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning, he said.
“It’s a true statement that a lot of the disaster dollars we need right now are related to climate change. That, in my opinion, is sort of inarguable,” he said.
Disasters like those that have occurred in recent years are expected to continue in the future, he said: “We’re in a new normal.”
The bill is logical from a fiscal standpoint, Josephson said.
As of now, the state’s disaster relief fund is “basically a sub-fund of the general fund,” and it gets whatever lawmakers are able to appropriate, he said. But if there is a new stream of money as proposed by his bill, “we would free up those dollars we’re otherwise spending in the disaster relief fund.”
At 20 cents per barrel, the proposed surcharge would raise about $30 million a year, he said.
In comparison, Gov. Mike Dunleavy in December proposed that lawmakers approve a $40 million appropriation for the state’s existing disaster relief fund. The need could increase from that total if the Trump administration fails to reimburse 100% of the costs for Typhoon Halong relief rather than the normal 75%. The Biden administration in 2022 approved 100% reimbursement for Merbok-related costs.
As introduced by Josephson, the bill would give the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation oversight over the money generated by the surcharge. It would distribute fund money in the form of grants to local governments and other entities for purposes like disaster response, disaster preparation and upgrades that make infrastructure better protected against climate change.
The surcharge idea has precedent in Alaska. The Department of Environmental Conservation already administers another fund with money coming from a per-barrel fee on oil produced in the state.

	After the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, the state began levying a 5-cent-per-barrel surcharge on oil that goes into the state’s Oil and Hazardous Substance Release Prevention and Response Fund. The fund itself was created by the legislature in 1986, with the surcharge established after the disastrous Prince William Sound spill.
That surcharge and rules concerning the fund’s operations have been modified over the years, broadening the purposes for which the fund can be used and boosting DEC’s reporting requirements, according to the department.
In its current configuration, each 5-cent-per-barrel surcharge sends 1 cent into a spill response account, to be used for spills that have been officially declared disasters. The other 4 cents goes into a spill prevention account, which can be used to address spills that have not been declared disasters, among other functions.
In 2015, refined petroleum products were added to the program. The state added a small surcharge, 0.95 cents per gallon, on refined fuel projects sold, transferred or used at the wholesale level, according to the DEC.
The idea of a similar levy to raise money for climate change preparedness and response is not new.
Rick Steiner, a retired University of Alaska marine conservation professor who founded and leads an environmental organization called Oasis Earth, has been advocating for the approach for several years.
“The legislature has so far seemed unable or unwilling to connect the dots between the many climate-related disasters we are experiencing — typhoon Merbok, wildfires, landslides, floods, coastal erosion, permafrost thaw, storm damage, infrastructure damage, subsistence impacts, commercial fishing impacts, etc..– to see the larger picture of the threat and costs these interrelated climate disasters pose,” he said in a letter to lawmakers sent last September. “The money to address these issues will have to come from government.”
In advocating for what he called an Alaska Climate Resilience Fund, Steiner said funding issues have become more pressing because of federal cutbacks.
The climate-response surcharge idea is not unique to Alaska, either.
Hawaii has put its version of a climate surcharge into law, a measure that seeks to raise money for responses to future disasters like the deadly 2023 Lahaina wildfire on the island of Maui.
In May, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, a Democrat, signed a bill that increases the state’s hotel and lodging tax by less than a percentage point. The increase is applied to the state’s Transient Accommodations Tax, known at TAT. The governor said the increase would amount to an additional charge of about $3 on a $400-a-night hotel room fee. It is expected to generate about $100 million a year, according to state officials.

Hoskinson Health Wellness Clinic's owner, Charles Hoskinson, also laid off 136 workers from his Gillette-based construction and concrete businesses in December.
The post Gillette clinic lays off around 40 people appeared first on WyoFile .","The Hoskinson Health Wellness Clinic announced plans Friday to eliminate around 40 positions at its Gillette medical facility. 
The clinic, which opened in 2022, said it’s not at risk of closing. It will continue serving 20,000 patients with a staff of around 250 employees, according to a clinic spokesperson. Patients affected by discontinued services will be notified directly. 
“To continue fulfilling its original goal of improving rural health care, the Clinic must come to terms with some harsh realities that have hurt its ability to perform in an efficient manner,” a clinic press release stated.
The clinic, along with construction and concrete businesses in Gillette that laid off a combined 136 workers in December, were founded by Charles Hoskinson, CEO and founder of Input Output Group. 
Declining reimbursement rates, escalating costs, including high provider salaries, and the facility’s payer mix were listed as factors driving the staff reduction in the clinic’s press release. 
“To ensure the Clinic can continue serving the people of Gillette and Northeast Wyoming who depend on us, the health care facility must operate in a significantly more cost-effective manner,” the release said. 
The layoff comes as Wyoming residents face mounting obstacles to health care access. Hospitals have shut down services like delivery wards in recent years, patients increasingly drive long distances for specialty care and state residents insured on the Affordable Care Act marketplace are experiencing the highest premium increases nationwide because Congress did not extend tax subsidies. 
“Hoskinson has been a key source of care for Gillette and surrounding communities, helping residents access medical services close to home,” Wyoming Health Resources Network Executive Director Amanda Teppo said. “Like many rural and frontier providers across Wyoming, it is facing financial pressures from rising costs and ongoing workforce shortages.
“While specific service changes are not yet known, reduced staffing could mean longer wait times, fewer care options, and increased strain on patients, providers, and emergency services,” she continued. “These challenges reflect the broader struggle to sustain reliable, accessible health care in rural and frontier communities throughout Wyoming.” 
Layoffs across town 
Hoskinson companies announced in December a combined 123 layoffs among its construction and concrete businesses in Gillette and that Hoskinson Concrete would be permanently closed. The actual number of layoffs in December was 136, a spokesperson told WyoFile on Friday.
Though some employees dispute this, the December job cuts were anticipated, according to the Hoskinson firm.
“The large-scale construction needs that led the clinic to create an in-house construction company have come to an end,” Hoskinson Contracting CEO Chris Davis said in a press statement at the time. “As a result, Hoskinson Contracting is scaling back its operations, and the Hoskinson Concrete division is being closed.”
Every laid-off employee would remain on payroll through January, a Hoskinson spokesperson told WyoFile at the time. A spokesperson confirmed the information with WyoFile on Friday.
Workers affected by layoffs can reach out to the Gillette Workforce Center, state workforce officials have advised. Job seekers can look for employment and register at the HireWyo website.

Furthermore, the lawsuit alleges that the seed company, Nutrien Ag Solutions, as well as its partner, the Montana Seed Growers Association, have known about an abusive pattern by the colony’s men, but rely on the Hutterite colony’s business and so disregarded the claims, even though court documents say the company investigated the allegation and found the company should have taken steps to make the workplace more secure.
The incident involves several interactions with male members of the Hilldale Colony and the Nutrien facility in Havre. The lawsuit accuses Leonard J. Waldner of sexually assaulting the victim, and says that the religious colony leaders have actually helped the man escape to Canada.
A request for comment by Nutrien went unanswered Friday by time of publication.
Court documents filed in Missoula County District Court say that early in her employment the victim raised safety concerns because she was sometimes the only employee at the facility. She requested Nutrien install security cameras, as she was also worried about vandalism. In the court filing, she also said that the company has a very specific policy against the use of deadly force and has a policy which outlaws pepper spray and tasers.
“Nutrien refused, claiming it was too expensive, delaying the installation of cameras due to only allowing approved vendors (on site),” the lawsuit said.
The victim renewed her request after an April 8, 2024 incident in which she recalled a semi-truck pulling up just as she was leaving work. It appeared the man, an unidentified Hutterite worker, needed help unloading pallets. She said the man asked if she was alone, and she told him she’d quickly unload them.
“Take your time, please. I like to watch a woman work,” the court documents said.
“He then watched the plaintiff very closely as she bent over to unload the pallets, making her physically uncomfortable,” the documents said.
When the victim told her supervisors about it, her boss said that he would be fired because of it, but seemed to blame the victim for not addressing it herself.
She then renewed her request for security cameras. According to the court filing, Nutrien did not install cameras.
On Oct. 17, 2024, she was working around lunch when the other employee was making deliveries. That’s when she interacted with Waldner. Often, the documents say, Hutterite colony workers would bring produce for sale, and she asked if they had any pumpkin pies. Though he said no, they agreed she’d buy one of their turkeys. As Waldner was leaving he stretched his arms to give her a hug, and she “awkwardly complied.”
“She felt uncomfortable, and even more so when Waldner whispered to her, ‘This is just between you and me,’” the court documents said.
The victim went back inside the office and saw the truck pull behind the building. He appeared in her office and brought her a pie. Notably, the victim said he had never come inside the office. He then walked around to her desk and looked at her family photos. The court documents record the alleged conversation:
“Isn’t it fun,” he asked.
She replied that she loved her family.
“No, the best part — and why I have five kids — is making them,” he said, recounting how nice the hug from her was.
Waldner asked about her coworker and she replied that he was at another colony.
“They sure leave you alone a lot and without cameras,” he said, according to court documents.
At that point, the court documents say that he physically moved toward her, pinning her with his legs, arms and body grabbing at her chest and pants. He pulled her pants down. She recounted that she feared if she tried to fight, he’d only become more aggressive, but felt him kissing her and making noises. When he stopped, he went to the bathroom, and the victim noted semen on the floor.
She told a coworker and then called her husband.
“They immediately called to report the assault to Havre Police Department. When (the victim) was put on the phone to try to tell police what had happened, she could not stop crying or calm down enough to articulate everything that had just occurred,” the court filing said.
The lawsuit alleges that the Havre Police never did follow up and Waldner was never questioned. She also reported the incident to Nutrien.
As a result, the lawsuit said she has been through therapy and has post-traumatic stress disorder after the assault.
According to court documents, when Nutrien investigated the assault, it found that she needed mental health support because of the “assaults and violent acts.” The report also said that the incidents also occurred within “Nutrien’s zone of influence” and that the company would need to further review “systemic deficiencies.”
Even after the incident, the victim witnessed three men from the Hilldale Colony telling the victim when she was alone, “You still don’t have cameras, huh?”
  Scope of the lawsuit 

The lawsuit doesn’t just describe the alleged incident in Hill County or Nutrien’s role. It also claims that the other defendants in the lawsuit, including the colony, and the Montana Seed Growers knew about this problem, and had documented other incidents.
The victim was employed by the Seed Growers to perform seed inspections and the organization had a rule about field inspections: Women were not allowed to conduct them alone because of the “Hutterite men like Waldner had a propensity to treat female MSGA employees in an unsafe manner.”
“Despite a known risk of sexual violence and o/or sexual harassment that Hutterite men like Waldner pose to women in the ag industry, the industry does not talk about it, warn women or take meaningful action to prevent it,” the lawsuit said. “The Hutterites’ business is important to the ag industry and defendants here put business over women’s safety.”
The lawsuit said that Nutrien’s general manager said that normally they’d cut off a client, in this case, the Hutterites, which engaged in behavior like this.
“But the accounts are too lucrative for Nutrien to do so,” the lawsuit said. “The Safety and Health Advisor for Nutrien communicated to the plaintiff that Hutterites are important because they keep prices low for the little farmers by buying in bulk.”
The lawsuit alleges a female employee at a Nutrien location in Idaho was attacked by a Hutterite truck driver and left her job. It also states that a woman working at a different Nutrien branch was attacked at approximately the same time and the company did nothing to remedy the problem, or take future actions to protect or warn employees.
The lawsuit said that all organizations knew about the behavior and did nothing to stop it, and the colony is being sued because Waldner was an employee and it should have taken precautions.
“Our aim is not only to secure justice, but to hold fully accountable all those who failed in their duty to protect her and to ensure meaningful change is implemented to protect other women working in Montana’s agricultural industry,” said attorney Michelle Simpson Tuegel.

This story by Sophia Langlois was first published in Valley News on Jan. 13, 2026.
WHITE RIVER JUNCTION — Isaiah Taylor recalls growing up in Woodsville in an extended family beset by violence and drugs. When he sought help for his addiction as a teenager, he felt no one would listen.
After seven years of incarceration for various crimes, Taylor, now 29, has spent the past year and a half rebuilding his life with help from the Hartford Community Restorative Justice Center, or HCRJC, which guided him as he reentered the job market and secured housing, he said. Its volunteers listened and empathized. 
“It’s not only breaking the cycle of addiction and abuse, but being a better parent to my kid and being a good partner,” said Taylor in an interview earlier this month at the Listen Dining Hall where he now works.
The Justice Center, first established in 2003, is a nonprofit organization that provides community housing, employment opportunities and basic necessities to those seeking a fresh start.
Many clients are referred by the Department of Corrections, but some visit the office on N. Main Street in White River Junction by their own volition. 
The Center currently has five employees and 40 volunteers from the community, Larry Blake Harvey, the Justice Center’s executive director, said. The organization is primarily funded by the Vermont Department of Corrections through transitional housing and restorative justice grants, in addition to other grants and community donations.

Harvey hopes to increase awareness about the work they do and bring in more volunteers.
“We are in a political and public climate where concerns about safety and crime feel more visible, and there is growing pressure on law enforcement and courts to respond more harshly,” Harvey said in an email.
The Center offers a safer, more effective response to harm, said Harvey.
There are programs to ensure mental wellness, including creative classes and Circles of Support and Accountability, or CoSA — which involve meeting with a support system of volunteers devoted to helping clients work through personal issues and plan for the future.
“The evidence is really clear. When the folks who are reentering society or communities after incarceration do not receive support and services similar to what we offer here, recidivism is a high likelihood,” Harvey said in an interview at the Center.
Of the more than 100 clients the center supports each year, more than 90% find employment and stability, and do not reoffend during program participation, according to the HCRJC website. About half of the Justice Center clients participate in its programs as an alternative to jail time for more minor crimes if completed successfully. 
As a child, Taylor’s home life involved drugs and abuse, he said. He felt stuck in this environment and remained surrounded by people who promoted a similar lifestyle, leading to an addiction to opiates, heroin and crack cocaine as a teenager.
After spending years in the prison system as a result of drug charges, aggravated assault and burglary, Taylor was released in 2024, hoping for stability. When first offered support by the Justice Center days prior to getting out, he thought it was too good to be true. Promises of housing and work had been made to Taylor before, but always seemed to fall apart.

“I’ve dealt with a lot of trauma, and been let down so much in my life,” said Taylor. “I’ve been through the system and the system is so corrupt that I felt like they were selling me hopes and dreams.”
The Center connected Taylor with Larry Lowndes, the former manager at Listen Dining Hall in White River Junction.
After Taylor volunteered at Listen for a summer, Sherise Simpson, Listen’s community meals manager at Listen, hired him, she said in an interview at the Listen Dining Hall Tuesday. As a recovery-friendly workplace, the organization is all about second chances, she said.
When Taylor first started working at Listen, the Human Resources department gave him an opportunity to explain his record based on information online regarding his past crimes. They listened to Taylor’s story, and he said he felt they trusted that his days of using drugs were behind him.
“I just think it’s good to be honest about it and talk about it because I feel like a lot of people don’t talk about it and that’s kind of the problem,” said Taylor. 
After one month as a dining hall food service assistant, Taylor was promoted to senior associate, Simpson said. He also earned two raises this year. She has no concerns about Taylor’s working ability and considers him kind and self driven.
“He cares about the guests; he cares about the food that goes out, about the quality,” said Simpson. “You can’t teach people skills. You can’t teach how to be nice.”
He now lives, with his girlfriend and 4-year-old daughter, in a post-transitional apartment with affordable rent coordinated by the Center, Harvey said. In his free time, Taylor focuses on health and fitness by going to the gym. 
The Justice Center also helped Johnathan Gordon, 45, reintegrate into society when he was released from incarceration in 2018, after serving an 11-year sentence. The Center helped Gordon find a restaurant job in White River Junction less than a week after he got out.

Gordon worked with his CoSA of 12 people over that first year to become more open about his past. He said that he had the biggest group of any client because he asked for extra support. 
“I wasn’t quite open about my offense or anything. They wanted me to be more open about it,” Gordon said in an interview at the Center earlier this month.
When it came to getting through the hiring process for later roles in White River Junction, Gordon decided to be upfront about his sex crime conviction, oftentimes having a conversation with the manager before even applying. 
“It took me a while to figure out how to say it, but I got used to it,” said Gordon.
A criminal record can create difficulty when seeking employment. However, both Taylor and Gordon say they found it effective to let their work ethic speak for itself. 
“I’m the type of employee who will show up 10 minutes before I’m doing the work,” said Gordon.
Gordon has worked at the Britton Lumber Company based in Bath, N.H., for about three months. Reached by phone, product manager John Moses, Gordon’s boss, declined to comment on his work ethic.
After his release from incarceration, in addition to finding work, Gordon began living independently in East Corinth and purchased a vehicle. In 2024, he married his husband, Phil Garland.
As of May 16, Gordon will no longer be on parole, meaning he’ll be completely free and unsupervised after 20 years in the justice system. He is interested in volunteering with the Center and, ultimately, finding a job that involves operating construction vehicles. Harvey said over the phone that Gordon already volunteers on a monthly basis, and is often the first to offer his advice and phone number to new clients.
Gordon advises future clients to ask for help and be open. The most important step is a willingness to change, he said, and the volunteers will help from there.
Kitty O’Hara, a Woodstock resident, is the longest-serving volunteer at the Center, having been involved since 2012. Gordon described her as his “strongest supporter” since the beginning of his time there, even teaching him to drive so he could get a license for the first time.
“We all make mistakes, and that doesn’t mean you can’t change,” said O’Hara. “To just dismiss them like they’re throwaway people, I just think that’s such a big mistake. They really can contribute back to society. They just need a little help.”
O’Hara said that those who complete long prison sentences often have never owned a cellphone before and need assistance setting up a bank account and getting a job. The goal is to help people move on by providing those initial resources as well as mental health support along the way. 
O’Hara teaches art classes at the Center for any interested clients. The creative projects promote mindfulness and connecting with other community members in a low-pressure environment, O’Hara said.
One student, Jonney Reisinger, 58, has a particular interest in art. As a member of the AVA Gallery in Lebanon, Reisinger had his art on display for a member show. 
Reisinger has been with the Center for two years, since completing a six-month sentence. During his first visit, Reisinger wasn’t sure who to trust. Now, he is proud to have created works of art and formed friendships with both volunteers and other clients. He bought a car and works in the warehouse at Upper Valley Produce, and looks forward to seeing what other opportunities come his way. 
“It’s so exciting to see that somebody I work with now is a member of the AVA Gallery (and) is showing some of his work,” said O’Hara. “And I look at John (Gordon), and how he’s progressed. It makes you feel good.”
The Center is seeking more volunteers as it expands programming in 2026. The organization plans to add new housing units, as an average of 140 people in Vermont stay in jail longer than their sentences due to a lack of transitional housing, Harvey said. The Center also wants to increase outreach by teaching community members — particularly youth — how to handle conflict and repair harm.
Harvey calls on community members to join the cause by taking an active role in helping respond to harm. Ways to contribute could include mentoring clients, supporting victims of crimes, practical assistance in transportation, job searches, etc., and teaching a special skill as a class at the Center.
Even as he is starting to move on from his past, Taylor said he wants to keep in touch with the people at the Justice Center because of how much they helped him. His job at Listen also gives him the chance to pay it forward. 
“I really like being here because I can help people that are in the same position as I was. I see a lot of homeless people my age come in and a lot of people who aren’t working, and I’ve helped a lot of people,” said Taylor. “It feels good to give back.”
Those interested in volunteering on a regular or occasional basis are encouraged to fill out the interest form on the HCRJC website.

Language in park’s 75-year-old founding legislation means its staff will have to make recommendations to provide more hunting, though opportunities may be limited. 
The post Trump administration wants to boost hunting in Grand Teton National Park appeared first on WyoFile .","The National Park Service has four months to develop ideas for how to increase elk hunting in Grand Teton National Park following a directive from U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.
A Jan. 7 secretarial order requires federal land managers to come up with recommendations for increasing hunting and fishing opportunities on public lands managed by the U.S. Department of Interior. 
Typically, the Park Service doesn’t allow hunting — the agency’s founding legislation, the 1916 Organic Act, generally prohibits it. But there are dozens of parks where Congress made an exception, and Grand Teton National Park is one of them. 
Teton Park spokeswoman Emily Davis referred WyoFile to the agency’s headquarters in Washington, D.C. for questions. The 310,000-acre park is still awaiting specific guidance regarding Burgum’s order, she said.

But the secretarial directive makes it clear that Teton Park has until May 8 to provide recommendations for “expanding opportunities” related to hunting authorized by Congress. Additionally, park staff must review regulations to “identify restrictions on hunting or fishing” that exceed their authorities and then identify “appropriate” modifications. 
In Grand Teton, elk hunting is the only type of hunting authorized by Congress. Language in the park’s enabling legislation calls for a “controlled and managed reduction” of elk by “qualified and experienced hunters” who are considered “deputized rangers.” Partly because of the setting — it takes place near roads and sometimes in view of tourists — the annual park hunt has proven controversial at times, even triggering litigation. 
The Park Service sets hunting seasons and quotas for Grand Teton’s annual fall hunt, dubbed a “reduction program,” in consultation with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department.

Because the Jackson Elk Herd has hovered slightly below its 11,000-animal objective and long-distance migrating elk pass through Teton Park, hunting there has been scaled back significantly. Although hundreds of licenses were once available for the hunt, tag numbers have fallen to 20 in the park, classified as hunt area 75 by Wyoming. 
Wildlife disease experts predict the Jackson Herd will shrink considerably in the years and decades to come because of the effects of chronic wasting disease. A planning process is underway to alter the historic practice of elk feeding and avert the worst consequences of the always-fatal disease.

Those factors may make it difficult for federal and state wildlife managers to achieve Burgum’s vision and ramp up elk hunting opportunities in Teton Park. 
“The Wyoming Game and Fish Department objective for the Jackson Elk Herd is 11,000, and it’s been below that for the last three years,” Wyoming Wildlife Advocates Executive Director Kristin Combs told WyoFile. “It seems like Game and Fish would not want to increase hunting within Grand Teton National Park.” 
The Wyoming Game and Fish Department declined an interview for this story. 
Grand Teton isn’t the only park that may run into difficulties, National Parks Conservation Association lobbyist Kristen Brengel said. There are nearly 70 Park Service units where hunting is permitted, including the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway, where hunting seasons are broader and mirror those set by Game and Fish. But the Congressional language authorizing park-specific hunts is oftentimes quite restrictive, she said. 
“You can’t abandon the Organic Act to hunt,” Brengel said. “That’s why I think this is going to be a fruitless exercise.” 
Brengel also questioned the wisdom of adding duties — in this case, requiring a planning process — for national parks that have been steadily shedding staff. The Park Service has lost a quarter of its staff since the second Trump administration began, she said, and as of October, Grand Teton’s full-time, year-round workforce had dwindled by 20%. 
“If Doug Burgum wants more of something, he should focus on more staff,” Brengel said. “You’re not going to get any of these things that he wants done with the amount of staff he has now at the Park Service.” 
Although Park Service advocates have not met Burgum’s directive favorably, the reception has been warmer in other circles. The order applies to all Interior Department agencies, including those where hunting is more commonplace, such as the Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

Greg Sheehan, president and CEO of the Mule Deer Foundation, called the directive “one of the most important conservation and access actions taken in decades.” 
“Secretary Burgum is reaffirming that hunting and fishing are not fringe activities on public lands,” Sheehan said in a statement. “They are foundational to how wildlife is conserved, funded, and managed in America.”
In a Congressional hearing Tuesday, Wyoming resident and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Brian Nesvik cited Burgum’s order as an example of the good he believes the Trump administration is doing for public lands. 
“I don’t believe that anybody should be worried about what this administration is doing with public lands,” Nesvik said.

Vermont should prepare for a future with more mysterious objects in the sky, one lawmaker argues.

Troy Headrick, I-Burlington, speaks before the House Government Operations Committee at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Friday, Jan. 16. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger

He started with an apology.
“If your inbox looks at all like mine since the introduction of this bill, I think I owe you all an apology,” Rep. Troy Headrick, I-Burlington, told the House Government Operations and Military Affairs Committee.
Why had Headrick’s bill — one of more than 600 in play in the House this session — caused such a stir?
Because H.654 is about UFOs. Sorta.
The bill proposes creating a state task force to evaluate reports of unidentified aerospace and underwater objects, assess airspace safety risks and coordinate with federal partners and academics on the topic, with the goal of recommending better policies for the future. The new body would be led by officials from Vermont’s departments of public safety and transportation, with additional membership from lawmakers and relevant experts. 
In short, the legislation concerns UAPs, or unidentified anomalous phenomena, a topic that’s attracted increasing federal attention and lawmaking.
There’s potential for fun in the proposed task force, too. 
“For the cryptids fans in the room, there’s an underwater provision to this as well, so if we want to investigate Champ, we can do that,” Headrick said, nodding to Vermont’s favorite sea monster. (In an interview, Headrick described himself as “agnostic” on the existence of extraterrestrial life.)
“I am not a subject matter expert at all,” Headrick said. “As policymakers, I think we have an obligation to remain attentive to emerging” trends in public safety, he added. 
And he expected military and commercial airline officials would line up to testify on Vermont’s attempt to stay ahead of the atmospheric curve. 
But if skeptics remain unconvinced of the need for his proposed task force, Headrick highlighted a more down-to-earth purpose.
“The proliferation of drone use — this is where I see the need for data,” Headrick told the committee. In the years to come, Vermonters might receive their groceries and packages via drones, as is already happening in other parts of the country. Buzzing propellers in the sky might not cause anyone to think twice as these unmanned aircrafts become normalized, but if they’re not regulated, Headrick suggested, there could be new safety concerns. 
Whether the gov ops committee, which typically examines the inner workings of state and municipal government, has the appetite to exit the stratosphere, time will tell. The body did take testimony from Tucker Anderson, a legislative attorney, to walk through the bill in all its legal detail — the last agenda item in a morning packed with new bills.  
“Appreciate the committee’s patience and tolerance for the last several hours of walkthroughs and overviews,” Anderson told lawmakers. “I always appreciate a close encounter with all of you.”

In the know
“Everything is on the table.”
That’s how Rep. Teddy Waszazak, D-Barre City, framed three bills that would transform the state’s approach to taxing Vermont’s high earners to his colleagues in the House Ways and Means Committee on Friday morning.
“The rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer,” Waszazak said. 
Waszazak’s H.619 would create a “surcharge” tax of 3% for those earning over $1 million, while H.621 would create two new top-level tax brackets that raise income tax by 3% and 5% for those making over $500,000 and over $1 million, respectively. He described the two measures as different approaches to the same idea.
H.620 would create a “wealth tax commission” tasked with analyzing the state’s taxation of wealth with a focus on areas that are “escaping taxation.” 
Waszazak pointed to his constituents in Barre City, some of whom he said are struggling to keep up with health care costs and the price of housing. “These are the folks … who we want to invest in as a state,” he said.

On the move
The House passed a bill Friday morning that would create an emergency aid fund for farms and forestry operations affected by natural disasters. Qualifying business owners could apply to recoup up to half of damages they can’t cover another way, up to $150,000. Despite devastating damage from floods and drought in recent years, roughly 70% of farms statewide don’t carry crop insurance.
S.60, which was introduced last year by Sen. Ruth Hardy, D-Addison, will return to the Senate for consideration. Several House committees made changes to the Senate’s version of the bill, which included making forestry outfits eligible for the fund, and adding a provision legislators say will streamline the payout process. 
The latest version of the bill doesn’t carry an appropriation, meaning the program won’t run — even if the bill becomes law — unless the Legislature sets aside money for it in the state budget. Some senators’ efforts to write an appropriation into the text of S.60 failed last year.

A fancy new floor plan
What good is the people’s house if people don’t know how to get in, or — if once they do get in — they don’t know where to go? 
That’s the question Sergeant-at-Arms Agatha Kessler posed to the Senate Institutions Committee. She showed the committee renderings Friday of a proposed new Statehouse entryway that a committee of lawmakers have been working to create with an architecture firm since 2023. 
“If you are not a regular here, it’s actually quite intimidating to figure out how to get into the building,” Kessler said. But with a new entryway, she hopes that could change. 
The proposed entrance is set to be on the west side of the building (or to the left if you’re facing it from the front). The curved glass facade would extend from the current building, giving space for a security screening area that funnels to a main lobby with a reception desk. 
The public would only be required to use that entrance during the session, said David Schutz, the state curator, while lawmakers and staff could enter the building through any door with their badge. 
The proposed design could address a need for enhanced security when, as Schutz put it, “important people” are in the building. 
Like everything in government, the project will take time. If everything goes as planned, the new entrance could open its doors for the 2030 session, Kessler said, though the timeline could change if lawmakers don’t want construction going on during the session.

Notable quotable
Vermont’s top economists had a shorter-than-usual timeframe this year to compose their January revenue forecast. Buried in one of their reports, which Tom Kavet and Jeff Carr presented to the Emergency Board on Friday, was the following:
“In an attempt to maximize our analytic time during this compressed schedule, and determine how close our jobs are to being replaced by AI, we explored feeding the economic and revenue facts we determined to be pertinent to various AI models, asking them to draft the text for this report in ‘our style.’”
The result? “Our jobs are safe for now,” the report said, though noted that “it won’t be long before AI could free up at least a day or two of time.”

(Provided by American Prairie)American Prairie’s permit to graze its bison on federal land has been revoked, according to a new decision from Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.
The nonprofit conservation group will lose its right to graze bison on seven plots of land in Phillips County. American Prairie has sought to reintroduce bison to parts of Montana, owning more than 500,000 acres in the state. The nonprofit organization has 940 head of bison across 46,000 acres and a mission to create one of the largest nature preserves in the country.
AP has grazed bison using federal leases since 2022. They stand to lose at least 63,000 acres of land they were leasing to graze on. The organization is also concerned about impacts to other livestock owners.
“Our organization and conservation model remain resilient, but that does not negate the fact that this creates uncertainty for all livestock owners who depend on public lands for grazing,” American Prairie CEO Alison Fox said in a press release. “We have followed the law, complied with every requirement, and prioritized transparency at every step.”
Opponents of their bison operation say the Taylor Grazing Act, a bedrock 1934 piece of agricultural legislation, does not allow for conservation grazing, which is essentially grazing that is done for multiple purposes, including ecological benefit. The act does not define what animals can be grazed, only that the Secretary of the Interior can permit “free grazing within such districts of livestock kept for domestic purposes.” 
In fact, the act appears more concerned with impacts to other industries, specifically naming various resources, like stone and clay, that can be used on those grazing lands and also protecting the ability to mine in those areas.
The Interior’s argument in the decision rests on two words that are not defined in the act: “livestock” and “domestic.” Two other federal laws cited in the decision — the Federal Land Policy and Management Act and the Public Rangeland Improvement Act don’t define the terms either.
“The BLM’s regulations define the term to mean “species of domestic livestock—cattle, sheep, horses, burros, and goats,” the decision said, citing federal code. “But that definition does not answer the question whether livestock can mean anything other than animals managed as part of a production-oriented operation.” 
The decision attempts to answer that question, saying that the term “stock” is tied to commerce and “domestic” is the opposite of “wild.”
“The dictionary definition, therefore, supports the proposition that livestock as used in the TGA and related authorities refers to animals “kept for sale or trade,” id., and that the authority to issue grazing permits and leases is limited to applicants who will use the animals to graze the public lands in that manner,” the decision reads.
American Prairie has insisted that there’s nothing in those laws preventing grazing by conservation herds. Even more, for they’ve said they qualify as a stock owner and that they are engaged in the livestock business. And they have sanctioned bison hunts as well.
“Our bison herd has supported food security, improved rangeland health, and created valuable opportunities for local nonprofits which include veterans associations, youth organizations, and local sportsmen’s chapters,” Fox said in a release. “Those benefits should matter. Instead, we’re seeing a departure from consistent application of the law that puts producers and working lands at risk.”
Burgum assumed control of the case last year, which came after pressure mounted from Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte and the four members of the state’s Congressional delegation.
He praised the decision in a press release.
“Today’s decision by BLM is a win for Montana’s ranchers, our agricultural producers, and the rule of law,” Gianforte said in a statement. “For years, we have raised serious concerns about the federal government’s failure to listen to the folks who live and work the land. By proposing to cancel these permits, BLM is finally acknowledging that federal overreach cannot come at the expense of our local communities and the production agriculture that feeds our nation. I’m proud of our administration’s work to achieve this decision and I would like to thank Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and BLM for following the law and putting Montanans first.”
In that letter, the politicians say American Prairie is harming the state economy, which the nonprofit has bristled at, calling the notion “absurd” last year. 
Gianforte painted the decision as a win for farmers and ranchers, though some ranchers have expressed that billionaire ranch owners are a bigger problem than any issues they might have at American Prairie.
“This administration will always stand with our farmers and ranchers against federal overreach,” Gov. Gianforte concluded. “We will continue to protect our way of life and ensure that Montana voices are heard in Washington, D.C.”
American Prairie has 15 days from receiving the decision to file an appeal. 
“American Prairie is reviewing the decision and determining its course of action, and will continue to advocate for a public-lands grazing system that is lawful, predictable, and applied equally,” a press release from the organization said.

With tricorn hats on their heads, the elementary school students attended South Carolina’s inaugural Liberty Day, a hands-on learning experience about the Revolutionary War.
Historical reenactors in more elaborate time-accurate garb dotted the House chamber and wandered the Statehouse lobby, where they explained to the children what life was like when the first shots of the American Revolution were fired in Massachusetts in 1775.

The idea came from the National Society of the Colonial Dames’ state chapter, said Molly Fortune, who leads SC250, a commission dedicated to recognizing the country’s 250th anniversary.
The commission put out applications to schools across the state, and when more applications came back than there was space for students, officials prioritized those with teachers who completed the dames’ 10-week course on Charleston’s colonial-era history, she said.
The goal was to get children out of the classroom and bring history to life for them, Fortune said.
“Kids learn really, really well when it’s hands-on,” Fortune said. “So, when the kids get to shake a rattle, or they get to actually touch the flax and weave with it, it opens a door that is not just history. It’s not just dates.”
One of the commission’s missions is to highlight stories that often go untold, including those of Native Americans, Black soldiers and women during the war.

A representative of the Catawba Nation, the state’s only federally recognized Native American tribe, showed children feathers, rattles and drums tribal members would have used during the Colonial era.
Beaufort-based Gullah Kinfolk Traveling Theater put on a version of Da’Gullah American Revolution Experience, a play about the Gullah Geechee experience during the American Revolution. Spinsters from Belle Sisters, who make period-accurate gowns for battle reenactments, demonstrated how to use a spinning wheel to make yarn.
Those stories can help engage children who don’t often see people like themselves in their history books, Fortune said.
“All these kids here today, if you saw it, it was a melting pot,” Fortune said. “Anybody can be a leader. That’s what I want them to take away from this.”
Names and dates were also important Friday. Fourth grade is when students start learning about American history, and those who visited the Statehouse came prepared. During a trivia contest that could have stumped some of the adults in the room, students knew nearly every answer.
Students divided into two teams representing the Continental Army, moving from colonies in the North and South. With each correct answer, the student troops advanced — using Post-It notes on a map — closer to Philadelphia, home of the Second Continental Congress where the Declaration of Independence was adopted on July 4, 1776.
Katherine Saunders Pemberton, SC250’s education and outreach manager, called the questions. A few examples:

What female plantation manager, who turned indigo into a major cash crop for South Carolina, supported the Patriots financially and helped Francis Marion escape the British? (Eliza Lucas Pinckney)
Which American general famously betrayed the Patriots and defected to the British? (Benedict Arnold)
What South Carolina fort built of palmetto logs and sand famously defended Charleston from the British Navy? (Fort Moultrie)

The team representing the southern colonies won.
The students impressed Gov. Henry McMaster, a history buff who talked the children through some of the battles fought in South Carolina.
“That was a great thing,” McMaster said afterward of watching the students answer trivia questions. “We’ll do it next year and do it right on, because our history, we’ve got a great story.”
The goal is to make the event annual, Fortune said. The celebration of the nation’s history doesn’t end with a big bash July 4. Instead, events will continue through 2033, the anniversary of the Treaty of Paris that formally ended the war.
Younger children have a lot to look forward to when they get their own turns at Liberty Day, said three students from Latta Elementary School in Dillon County.
History is already fun, said the three students, but seeing it happen in front of them made it even more so.
“This has been the most exciting field trip I’ve ever had,” said fourth grader Alexander Barnhardt.

(Photo by Jeff Fisher/ACEP)For much of the past half-century, nuclear energy in the United States has occupied an uneasy space between a technology of the past and a technology of the future — but not quite one of the present. That is beginning to change, and Alaska is part of that shift. 
A couple of months ago, Project Janus, an initiative led by the Department of the Army, identified Fort Wainwright as one of nine candidate sites for deploying a new generation of small, advanced nuclear reactors. While the announcement received little public attention in Alaska, the program is significant. Janus is designed not only to support the energy security of military installations, but also to move advanced nuclear from isolated pilot projects toward repeatable, “nth-of-a-kind” deployments, where costs are expected to become more predictable and decline over time relative to first-of-a-kind efforts.
This follows on the heels of a June 2025 announcement that Oklo Inc. was selected to move forward on a planned microreactor deployment at Eielson Air Force Base. Taken together with other demonstrations and commercial proposals now moving through testing and licensing, these projects point to a broader shift: new nuclear is no longer hypothetical — it is beginning to move into real-world deployment.
Why nuclear stalled
Nuclear power in the United States generates roughly 20% of the nation’s electricity — about the same share as all renewable sources combined — yet it is often perceived as static and outdated. While wind, solar and battery storage have seen rapid, highly visible innovation and have dominated conversations about the energy future, nuclear has largely been associated with aging plants, long development timelines and high costs.
From time to time, talk of a nuclear renaissance has resurfaced. But for years, that renaissance seemed perpetually just out of reach — always promised, but not delivered. Large projects such as the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia came to symbolize this tension. Built around conventional, large-scale reactor designs developed decades earlier, Vogtle’s long delays and multibillion-dollar cost overruns ultimately hardened public skepticism about whether nuclear still had a role to play in the nation’s future energy supply.
For many observers, the question became not whether nuclear power could work, but whether it still made sense in an energy landscape increasingly shaped by shorter build times and greater flexibility in how capacity is sized and deployed. Wind, solar and natural gas plants can often be built quickly, with far less up-front capital and can be scaled incrementally. Against that backdrop, large, conventional nuclear projects increasingly appeared obsolete.
Reimagining nuclear
This new generation of nuclear technologies is not trying to solve old problems by building better versions of the same systems. Instead, it represents a fundamental rethinking of how nuclear power is designed, built and used. New designs emphasize smaller-scale, standardized systems that can be factory-assembled and rapidly deployed to a site. This shift reflects an effort to adapt nuclear technology to the practical realities of today’s energy landscape.
A major focus of this new wave of nuclear innovation has been safety. Traditional nuclear plants rely on multiple engineered systems, layers of redundancy and highly trained operators to manage risk. By contrast, many advanced reactor designs place greater emphasis on inherent or passive safety: Both the reactor and its fuel are designed to remain stable under extreme conditions.
These more accident-tolerant approaches are being put into practice. A major milestone occurred a few months ago, when the first fuel shipment designed specifically for these advanced reactors arrived at Idaho National Laboratory. The fuel, known as TRISO, is configured differently from conventional nuclear fuel. In TRISO fuel, uranium is encapsulated within multiple ceramic layers designed to withstand extreme heat and physical stress. As a result, a significant portion of the safety function is built directly into the fuel itself. 
This initial production run will support the first advanced reactors to be tested at Idaho National Laboratory in several decades. Commercial demonstrations are expected to follow, with multiple vendors seeking access to the laboratory’s limited testing infrastructure, including Oklo Inc.
What Alaskans are saying
Surveys conducted by Strategies 360 on behalf of the Alaska Center for Energy and Power at UAF over several years show that Alaskans across a broad spectrum of communities and political views consistently favor greater diversification of the state’s energy systems. Respondents support expanding hydroelectric, solar and wind resources while reducing reliance on gas and coal.
Views on nuclear energy remain more mixed, though they are evolving. In the most recent poll, a slim majority of respondents said they would be open to greater use of nuclear energy in Alaska, while the share of those strongly opposed has dropped below 10 percent. Support increases when respondents are provided with additional information: Those who report greater familiarity with nuclear energy tend to be more supportive overall, and among less familiar respondents, interest rises substantially after hearing a brief, neutral description of advanced nuclear technologies. Taken together, these results suggest that many Alaskans are receptive to learning more and engaging on the issue as new information becomes available.
Taking stock: Where are we now?
While progress is encouraging, we still have a way to go before these technologies are available off the shelf. Even the vendors closest to market remain in design, licensing or early demonstration phases. New nuclear technology is no longer purely theoretical, but it is still far from an established technology.
There are also important unresolved questions: how these systems will perform over time; how they will be financed, owned and operated; how regulatory frameworks will adapt; and how issues such as waste management and emergency planning will be addressed. These questions can only be answered through experience — by moving projects from concept to operation and learning from them along the way. And that’s exactly what’s happening.
One reason this moment feels different is the level of sustained federal involvement and investment — an area of rare continuity in U.S. energy policy. Support for advanced nuclear has continued across both the Biden and Trump administrations, enabling momentum in addressing long-standing barriers that have kept these technologies from moving beyond paper studies and early prototypes.
Alaska is already playing an important role. Through defense-led demonstrations, research activities and early commercial proposals, it is reasonable to expect continued discussion and activity in the coming years. Decisions about how far Alaska ultimately leans into a new nuclear era will rest with Alaskans themselves. In the near term, the state clearly has a seat at the table. The question ahead is not whether nuclear can be developed, but when — and under what conditions — Alaskans will decide whether it belongs as part of the state’s future energy mix.
Where to learn more
In that spirit, on Jan. 27–28, the Alaska Center for Energy and Power at the University of Alaska Fairbanks will host a free, online workshop bringing together national experts and Alaskans to explore where nuclear energy actually stands today — technically, regulatory-wise and programmatically. The goal is not to advocate for a particular outcome, but to ensure Alaskans have access to clear, current information as these conversations continue.

Travis denied a motion for a temporary injunction in a suit challenging a Kentucky licensing law. (Getty Images) LEXINGTON — A judge on Friday declined to enjoin enforcement of a state law that governs the licensing of alcohol and drug counselors and peer support specialists.
The decision came as a new state law threatens to put many Kentucky peer support specialists out of work.
Fayette Circuit Judge Thomas L. Travis
Two applicants for licenses and a Lexington-based nonprofit filed suit contending that it’s impossible for them to comply with the new law because the state Board of Alcohol and Drug Counselors has failed to enact any regulations implementing it. They say the board has let other regulations expire, including those governing disciplinary actions and appeals and the code of ethics that license-holders must promise to follow.
The legislature approved and Gov. Andy Beshear signed the new law — contained in House Bill 505 —  in 2024. It took effect Jan. 1 and changes credentialing standards to work and be paid in many treatment and recovery settings. 
During an afternoon hearing, Fayette Circuit Judge Thomas L. Travis said, “In an ideal world the regulations should have been promulgated long before now. Maybe there’s a reasonable explanation for that. I just don’t know.”
But Travis ruled that the plaintiffs had failed to satisfy the requirements for issuing a temporary injunction, including a showing of irreparable harm.
The lawsuit was filed on behalf of peer support specialists Wes Hagenbuch and Adrianna Kenley and Grin Grant Inc., a nonprofit that employs and trains peer support workers. 
Kentucky set to pull funding from peer support for recovery, is asked to reconsider

The defendants are the Kentucky Board of Alcohol and Drug Counselors; the Cabinet for Health and Family Services and its secretary, Dr. Steven Stack, and the state Department for Behavioral Health, Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities.
A state lawyer representing the Board of Alcohol and Drug Counselors argued that enjoining enforcement of the board’s statutory framework would preclude the board from issuing any licenses or enacting regulations, thereby delaying the relief the plaintiffs seek.
The lawsuit, which asks the judge to declare the law void, will now proceed on its merits. Travis gave the state agencies until Jan. 30 to file pleadings responding to the suit’s allegations.
Peer support is considered an essential ingredient in recovery. Peer support specialists, who earn $15-$18 an hour in Kentucky, share their first-hand experiences of addiction and hope with those new to recovery. Their duties range from providing transportation to medical appointments and court dates to teaching problem-solving skills.
As of Friday the board had licensed 78 individuals as registered alcohol and drug peer support specialists compared with 16,883 who are certified under the previous standards.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1135138396-scaled-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-16 18:57:57.277827

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Three Washington state senators said the biting testimony Pierce County’s sheriff delivered during a committee hearing Thursday was threatening to legislators.
Sheriff Keith Swank delivered the remarks to the Senate Law and Justice Committee, stating his opposition to legislation that would set stricter eligibility requirements for people to serve as sheriffs and in other law enforcement leadership jobs. In his roughly 90 seconds of comments, Swank also remarked on a bill that would restrict officers from wearing masks.
“My deputies don’t wear masks, but once you pass this law that they can’t, I would not only allow them, but I would encourage them to do so just to see what you do,” he said.
“I don’t recognize your authority to impose these controls over me and when you try to remove me from office, thousands of Pierce County residents will surround the County-City Building in downtown Tacoma and will not allow that to happen,” he continued. “I hope it doesn’t come to that, but I, and they, are prepared. Are you prepared?”
The sponsor of the bill on eligibility standards for law enforcement officials, Sen. John Lovick, D-Mill Creek, served as a state trooper and Snohomish County sheriff.

He saw Swank’s comments asking if lawmakers were “prepared” as “very, very threatening.” He compared Swank’s intimidating behavior to Eugene “Bull” Connor, the 20th-century Alabama police leader who opposed civil rights for Black people and was known for ordering the use of fire hoses and police dogs on demonstrators. 
“He just doesn’t represent what law enforcement is supposed to represent,” Lovick said. 
As a sheriff, Lovick said he wanted to set the example for his rank-and-file deputies. 
“I want them to display the same characteristics I have,” Lovick said. “If I go and talk to legislators like that, they might feel compelled to speak to the public that way.”
Law and Justice Committee Chair Manka Dhingra, D-Redmond, said she has a thick skin after being a prosecutor for 20 years. 
“I recognized threats in his speech, but I do not get intimidated by bullies,” she said Friday.
The Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs condemned Swank’s comments as “inflammatory” and said it plans to initiate proceedings to consider expelling him from the organization.
“The scope of his testimony went beyond reasonable dialogue and devolved into what could be perceived as threatening to legislators and he challenged their constitutional authority,” association leadership said in a statement. “The manner in which he conducted himself was not in line with the professional behavior we expect of members.”
The association noted it also has “grave concerns” with the legislation.
Dhingra appreciates the association’s move to potentially expel Swank, but it is “something that should’ve been handled a long time ago,” citing Swank’s history of controversial behavior in office. 
Just this month, Swank clashed with Thurston County Sheriff Derek Sanders in the aftermath of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shooting a woman in her car in Minnesota. 
“PSA: if law enforcement tells you to stop. STOP,” Swank wrote on social media. “You can always sue later if your rights were violated. Even if you are right, do you want to be dead right?”
Sanders believed Swank was mocking the woman’s death, leading to a tense back-and-forth. Swank has also faced backlash for disparaging transgender people and defending those who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.
A spokesperson for the association of sheriffs and police chiefs declined to comment on whether Swank’s prior controversies played a role in its decision to begin expulsion proceedings.
Sen. Yasmin Trudeau, who serves as vice chair of the Law and Justice Committee, said she felt more directly threatened by Swank’s comments Thursday as she lives in Pierce County. The Tacoma Democrat argued it showed how “off the rails he actually is.”
“I think he’s an embarrassment to the profession,” she said.
There isn’t a timeline for a decision on Swank’s future with the Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs, spokesperson Barbara Smith said. 
Eight members of the organization’s 14-member board would be needed to remove Swank from the organization, which wouldn’t affect his position as the elected county sheriff. The influential group advocates on behalf of law enforcement leaders and administers some state-funded programs.
Swank worked for the Seattle Police Department for 33 years before retiring in 2023. He won a tight election to become Pierce County sheriff in November 2024. Pierce County, home to Tacoma, has about 940,000 residents.
Swank didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But in a social media post, he included the testimony he would’ve given if he had more time. In it, he called Democratic lawmakers “evil” and compared them to President Donald Trump. 
“You Democrats hate President Trump so much, yet you do the very things you accuse him of doing such as imposing these types of controls over other independently elected officials,” Swank wrote. 
Swank also wrote that his potential expulsion from the sheriffs and police chiefs association “is what happens when you don’t tow the party line.”
Lovick’s bill would require elected sheriffs to meet the same, new heightened eligibility standards as appointed police chiefs and marshals and would force them to undergo a background check. It also limits the use of volunteers amid concerns of so-called “posses” that rural sheriffs sometimes build. It is set for a vote from the Law and Justice Committee next week.
Swank is the subject of three Criminal Justice Training Commission cases related to his certification as a law enforcement officer, but none appear to have been assigned to an investigator, according to the commission. Under the bill, if he were decertified, he would have to vacate his role as sheriff.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sen.-Manka-Dhingra-State-of-the-State-2026-1-e1768603676110.png,,,2026-01-16 18:57:57.277827

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The American Farm Bureau Federation, along with soybean and specialty crop farm organizations, has asked congressional leadership for economic support to “fill in the gap of remaining losses for both field and specialty crop farmers.” 
The letter follows a December announcement from the Trump administration of a $12 billion one-time package to offset farmer losses across the country.
“These funds could provide a meaningful first step but do not cover the extensive and cumulative losses that farmers have absorbed over the last several years,” the letter said after acknowledging the farmer bridge payment program.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture is allocating the funding with commodity specific payment rates and set aside $1 billion of the $12 billion for specialty crop farmers. 
The American Soybean Association, a signee on the recently submitted letter, said in a news release the $30.88 per acre allotted for soybeans from the payment package was not enough to cover the “significant financial damage soybean farmers sustained this year due to the high cost of production and losses sustained during the China trade war.” 
Grant Kimberley, Iowa Soybean Association’s director of market development, said the additional need from farmers is “complicated” and is a result of more than just one event in the past year. 
“I think people don’t really realize this has been going on for a couple years now,” Kimberley said. “… Just about every row crop agriculture sector in the whole country has been losing money, probably, for the last three years.”
Kimberley said the ongoing downturn in the industry is due to several factors, including low commodity prices, high input costs, changes in global trade and uncertainty in domestic markets. 
Data from Farm Bureau show that commodity prices for major row crops like corn, soybeans, cotton and wheat have declined each year since 2022. 
Kimberley said as the prices that farmers can get for their crops has declined, expenses have not declined, and have instead increased.  Land, rent, equipment and inputs like fertilizer, seed and chemicals continue to squeeze farmers’ bottom lines, he said.
Farm Bureau economists found that farm expenses in 2025 were 12% higher than the previous five-year average cost. 
Another piece to the puzzle, Kimberley explained, is the growing soybean and row crop markets in Brazil and other South American countries. He said the expansion of these markets has interrupted U.S. demand, especially with big buyers like China. 
China also declined to purchase U.S. soybeans for the beginning part of harvest season due to President Donald Trump’s trade policies. While the country later agreed to a trade deal, Kimberley said it’s less than what the country previously bought from the U.S. and the gap in purchasing this year has also had an effect. 
Kimberley also pointed to the lack of finalized guidance from federal agencies on renewable fuel standards and tax credits. Many of these initiatives, like 45Z tax credits for low-carbon fuel, were initiated during the Biden administration and still do not have finalized guidelines.
Other standards, like the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s blending standards, were proposed over the summer and have yet to be finalized. Kimberley, who is also executive director of the Iowa Biodiesel Board, said this uncertainty means overall biodiesel production has declined in the state, causing a “ripple in the pond” for soybean demand.
“You can’t really just say it’s this or that, you know, it’s all of these things that have kind of added up a little bit over time,” Kimberley said.
The letter from American Farm Bureau Federation also noted the compounding factors squeezing farmers. According to the letter, farmer bankruptcies are increasing and nationwide farmer losses are approaching $100 billion. 
“These trends aren’t just statistics; they represent an economic crisis in rural America,” the letter said. 
Specialty crop farmers are also struggling under similar pressures and asked Congress for relief. 
The majority of the more than 50 organizations that signed the letter represented specialty crop growers. 
In a news release about the letter, the Specialty Crop Farm Bill Alliance said that despite the fact that specialty crops account for more than one-third of all U.S. crop sales, the farmer bridge program from USDA allocated just $1 billion to the industry. 
“Any agricultural aid package should reflect the economic contribution of specialty crops, which support rural communities and provide key nutrition,” the alliance leadership said in the release. 
The letter, addressed to House and Senate leadership, ask for “immediate” congressionally approved support. 
Kimberley said additional changes need to occur in the farm economy for farmers to be profitable, but those changes won’t happen overnight.
“None of these things make farmers whole, and (aid packages) are not preferred, but sometimes they’re necessary,” Kimberley said.

(Pool photo by Tanner Ecker/Bismarck Tribune)The North Dakota Attorney General’s Office on Friday ordered a Fargo nonprofit to stop promoting certain abortion pill providers on its website.
The order accuses the Prairie Abortion Fund of violating a state consumer protection law by including links on its website to sites where counterfeit pills may be purchased without a prescription or the oversight or a doctor.
Caitlin Wachsmuth, co-chair of Prairie Abortion Fund’s board, said Friday afternoon the organization was holding off on speaking publicly about the cease-and-desist order until it could seek input from legal counsel.
Abortion is almost entirely illegal in North Dakota. There is no abortion clinic operating in the state.
The mission of Prairie Abortion Fund, which dates back to 1999, is to help women access abortions in North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota. This includes providing financial assistance with the cost of abortion-related medical care, transportation and birth control, among other expenses, its website states.
In the order, the Attorney General’s Office says the Bureau of Criminal Investigation was able to successfully purchase abortion pills without a prescription from two businesses listed on Prairie Action Fund’s webpage.
The agency says these pills “are not FDA approved” and contain ingredients that must be prescribed by a doctor.
By facilitating access to the pills, Prairie Abortion Fund lends credibility to “counterfeit, unapproved, untested, misbranded or misrepresented products,” the Attorney General’s Office argues in the order.
The order states that the Attorney General’s Crime Laboratory Division conducted some tests on the pills purchased through retailers found through the nonprofit’s website.
The test found “at least some of the tablets contained the represented content mifepristone,” and no controlled substances were detected in the pills.
The laboratory could not test whether the dosage strengths of the pills were the same as advertised by the retailers, according to the order.
The agency notes the North Dakota’s Abortion Control Act requires doctors to be physically present any time the abortion medications mifepristone and misoprostol are administered to a patient.
The order also claims the nonprofit is breaking federal and state laws that prohibit the sale of misbranded drugs.
Prairie Abortion Fund’s website says that it is “intended for informational purposes only” and “does not provide medical or legal advice.”
North Dakota abortion ban deemed constitutional in split opinion from state Supreme Court

“Prairie Abortion Fund is making efforts to comply with applicable law and regulations to the best of its understanding and ability,” the website states.
If Prairie Abortion Fund wishes to challenge the cease-and-desist order, it has 10 days to request an administrative hearing with the attorney general, according to state law.
Violating the order could result in fines of $1,000 per violation. Additionally, North Dakota’s Consumer Fraud Law carries penalties of up to $5,000 per violation.
According to Prairie Action Fund’s website, the nonprofit has served more than 600 callers. Its work has included distributing more than 1,000 Plan B contraception pills, providing at least $104,000 to patients seeking abortion care and $172,000 in birth control assistance. 
Abortion is illegal in North Dakota except in cases of rape or incest if the mother has been pregnant less than six weeks, or when the pregnancy would be considered a serious physical health threat under “reasonable medical judgment.”
The law was upheld late last year after the North Dakota Supreme Court ruled 3-2 that the ban is unconstitutional. A supermajority vote of four of five justices is required to strike down a law.

Jan. 14, 2026. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — The Nebraska Medicine Board of Directors is officially suing to stop the University of Nebraska Board of Regents from securing sole ownership of the nonprofit using an $800 million deal with Clarkson Regional Health Services.
Nebraska Medicine filed the lawsuit Friday, less than 24 hours after the regents voted unanimously to proceed with the $800 million deal. Regents and NU President Dr. Jeffrey Gold had described it as similar to divorce proceedings or selling a house, with sole ownership expected to be transferred by June 30.
Both NU and Clarkson have maintained a 50-50 split of the hospital, clinical and medical nonprofit since 1997.
The transaction, plus a promised donation from Clarkson to NU, is as follows:

$500 million for NU to buy out Clarkson’s 50% share of Nebraska Medicine.
$300 million for NU to purchase related Clarkson-area properties.
$200 million that Clarkson pledges to donate to NU for “Project Health” in Omaha, a $2.19 billion endeavor to build up the next generation of health care.

NU regents unanimously approve $800M Clarkson deal for Nebraska Medicine

In a brief statement Friday, Nebraska Medicine wrote: “This is a necessary but unfortunate step to take, but it is aligned with our commitment to protect the mission of Nebraska Medicine. Out of respect for the judicial process, we will let our complaint explain our serious concerns and requests, and we will not provide further comment.”
An NU spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment. 
Gold and NU regents have argued they are following their legal interpretation of the joint agreement, including advice they said came from the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office. NU leaders also said they acted quickly, in part, to prevent Clarkson from seeking to sell its share to an out-of-state or for profit entity.
The lawsuit, filed in Douglas County District Court, asks the court to decide whether the regents and Clarkson can “unilaterally” enter into transactions that Nebraska Medicine leaders argue violate a joint agreement between NU and Clarkson and Nebraska Medicine’s governing documents.
Nebraska Medicine leaders have argued Clarkson can withdraw from its ownership stake only if the Nebraska Medicine board and NU sign off.
“Plaintiffs believe this answer is clearly no, and thus, file this lawsuit to stop an imminent, harmful and, in part, unlawful, set of transactions,” the lawsuit reads in part.
Nebraska Medicine leaders had argued the deal was unlawful ever since NU and Clarkson publicly announced the idea Jan. 2 after a year and a half of closed-door negotiations that both entities said were subject to “strict” nondisclosure agreements.
This is a developing story.

Democrat Hannah Pingree and Republican Jonathan Bush have each raised more than $1.3 million, and Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat, has also received more than a million in contributions. But while the Democratic candidates’ contributions are in part from many Mainers chipping in small amounts, most of Bush’s donors contributed the legal maximum: $2,075.
That’s according to a Maine Morning Star analysis of the latest campaign finance reports published on the Maine Ethics Commission website, detailing fundraising from the second half of 2025.
Former Maine House of Representatives Speaker Pingree has consistently led the race in fundraising since she launched her campaign in June, amassing more than $1.4 million, according to the January 15 report. Her campaign said donations came in from all 16 counties and nearly 300 Maine towns, “reflecting the campaign’s statewide reach and growing support as Hannah continues to meet with workers, families, small business owners, and community leaders across Maine.”
According to Maine Ethics Commission data, Pingree’s campaign reported contributions from more than 1,800 unique donors, including several state representatives and officials, including Attorney General Aaron Frey. That aligns with the endorsements she’s received from more than 100 former and current state leaders. She raised more than $58,000 in small contributions of $50 or less. Pingree also received two donations for the maximum amount from her mother, U.S. Representative Chellie Pingree, as well as contributions from Gov. Janet Mills’ siblings, Dora Mills and Peter Mills.  
Bush, a health care entrepreneur, entered the campaign months after Pingree and Bellows in October, but has assembled the second largest war chest.A significant part of that is the $300,000 loan he gave himself, but Bush’s fundraising stands out for the large number of out-of-state contributions. He also received a high number of contributions for the legal maximum, including a donation from his cousin, former President George W. Bush. Overall, Bush raised close to a million from fewer than 700 unique contributors.
Bush is currently leading the Republican gubernatorial candidates in fundraising, with attorney and Leeds resident Bobby Charles in second place with more than $500,000 raised. Bush’s campaign manager Eamonn Dundon highlighted his fundraising as proof that he can beat Democrats in the general election.
“The rest of the candidates in the Republican field are nice guys with some good ideas, but they’ve shown now that they can’t compete with Democrats’ massive money machine that will be trained at whoever our nominee is in June,” Dundon said in a press release. 
With just over a million dollars in the bank, Bellows’ — who was first to announce her run last March — leads in the most small dollar contributions: more than $146,000 in amounts of $50 or less.
“The Maine Ethics Commission’s end of year reports show what Mainers have already known: Shenna Bellows is the leading candidate for Maine Governor,” her campaign said in a press release.
Democrats Angus King III, a businessman, and former Maine Senate President Troy Jackson follow, with $900,000 and $600,000 raised, respectively. And although former head of Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Dr. Nirav Shah only entered the race in October, he has already raised more than $500,000, as has independent Sen. Rick Bennett. Republicans David Jones and Owen McCarthy have raised $400,000 and $300,000 each, although both gave their own campaigns big loans.

(Photo by Max Nesterak/MInnesota Reformer)Two videos add new details to what happened before and after an immigration agent shot a man in the leg in the Hawthorne neighborhood in north Minneapolis Wednesday night.
One video, a livestream of a 911 call from inside the house, includes a woman saying that the immigration agent shot the man, who she said is her husband, as he was entering the house. The livestream also shows at least one child present in the house.
Another video, taken by a north Minneapolis resident from across the street and shared with the Reformer, shows federal agents firing numerous times into the house, breaking a second-floor window.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in an email to the Reformer on Friday that the agents had fired tear gas, not live rounds.
The incident began on Interstate 94, where federal agents were trying to apprehend a man, federal law enforcement and Minneapolis police said. The man drove toward a house on the 600 block of 24th Avenue North in north Minneapolis, where he wrecked the car outside the house and ran towards the house, federal and local law enforcement said.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement Thursday that the man who was shot is Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, an undocumented Venezuelan national, and that he “began to resist and violently assault the officer.”
“While Sosa-Celis and law enforcement were in a struggle on the ground, two subjects came out of a nearby apartment and attacked the law enforcement officer with a snow shovel and broom handle,” the official federal statement said. The statement goes on to say that Sosa-Celis then began striking an officer with a shovel or broom stick.

According to the DHS statement, the officer, fearing for his life and safety, then “fired a defensive shot to defend his life,” after which the three men ran into the house.
Federal immigration agents arrested all three men, the statement said, and Sosa-Celis and the officer who shot him were at the hospital when the statement was published.
The Washington Post interviewed Sosa-Celis’s mother, Alicia Celis, who said her son told her that the man who was pursued by federal agents was actually Sosa-Celis’s friend, one of the three men arrested.
Facebook livestream of 911 call and observer video
According to Celis, Sosa-Celis opened the door to let his friend inside, and as Sosa-Celis went to close the door, an ICE officer shot him in the leg, reported the Post.
A Facebook livestream video, which appears to show the moments after the man was shot from the perspective of his wife and other people inside the house, partly lines up with Sosa-Celis’s account. The video was published by an account by the name of Lachamaka Mendoza and is timestamped to Wednesday 6:51 p.m., the exact time Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said local police started receiving 911 calls about the shooting.
The Reformer has requested records of the 911 calls made after the shooting to further verify the video.
In the video, at least five people, including one small child, are in a house while law enforcement lights flash outside. They speak on the phone in Spanish to what sounds like a 911 operator, saying that someone has been shot in the leg by “guys from ICE.”
“Please help, we have kids,” one person said.
A woman then tells the operator: “It was ICE, they were chasing my husband for like half an hour and they were trying to crash into him. He got to the house and as we were closing the door they shot him.”
Another woman adds: “Tell them that they shot the door.” It is not clear from the video whether she meant that the agents shot through the doorway or at a door.
The 911 call suggests that the agent shot at the man as he was trying to escape into the house, which would contradict the Department of Homeland Security account that the federal immigration agent fired a shot defensively.

A separate video taken by a north Minneapolis resident starts around 7:26 p.m. and shows the vantage from across 24th Avenue North.
In that video, over a dozen agents surround the house. At minute 2:55 in the video, the agents fire what DHS said was tear gas into the house, shattering the second floor window; at least three more shots are heard later.
At around 5 minutes into the video, federal agents enter the house. One observer yells that there are children in the house. Around 16 minutes into the video, a woman who appears to be wearing a pink shirt exits the house — the Facebook livestream video also included a woman with a pink shirt.
“This is something I would have never expected to see in my life,” said the man who took the video and was granted anonymity by the Reformer. “It’s still hard for me to believe that this is actually happening in my city, so close to my home.”
The BCA’s independent investigation
The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, the state agency that investigates law enforcement shootings, was on the scene Wednesday night along with FBI agents to process evidence.
Also present at the scene were Minnesota State Patrol and Hennepin County sheriff’s deputies, which O’Hara said were there to help control the crowd of over 100 protestors and observers who had gathered, as well as Federal Bureau of Prisons officers.
The BCA said in an X post Wednesday night that it is investigating the shooting in an independent investigation.
The shooting comes one week after the killing of Renee Good by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross in south Minneapolis touched off a wave of protests. In the immediate aftermath of the killing of Renee Good, the Trump administration said she was attempting to run over the ICE officer and kill him. But bystander footage shows a chaotic scene with the officer to the side of her car when he shoots her as she seemingly tries to flee.
All three men are from Venezuela and came to the U.S. in 2022 and 2023, according to the DHS statement. The statement describes two of the men as criminals, though the only listed offenses for Sosa-Celis are driving without a license and giving a false name to a law enforcement officer.
Minnesota court records show that a 24-year-old Julio Cesar Sosa Celis has been fined for speeding and driving without a license or proof of insurance.

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Leaders of the New Mexico House of Representatives gathered Friday at a South Valley health care clinic to tout their agenda for the upcoming session, one they said will make life better and more affordable without overspending amid a possible economic downturn.
The Democrats gave general outlines for how they intend to use legislation and the budget process to increase health care access, protect immigrants and improve public safety all within 30 days. House Speaker Javier Martinez (D-Albuquerque) predicted the Legislature’s achievements will offer a stark contrast to the “dysfunction” in Washington, D.C. 
“We will have to make hard choices as we build the state budget, because, unlike the federal government, we have to have a balanced budget every single day,” he said. “So we’ll have to make sure that we put families first and not balance those budgets on their backs, which I can assure you, we will not.”

In addition to passing a roughly $11 billion operating budget, the Legislature will consider legislation regarding medical malpractice and other health care reforms, a ban on local government involvement in immigrant detention, public safety and road repairs.
According to the speakers and a news release the House released Friday afternoon, House Democrats are hoping to attract and retain more doctors; hold gun dealers accountable for straw purchases; protect license plate data from being shared with the federal government; and create an independent commission overseeing the Children, Youth and Families Department, among other proposals. 
“We may not know all that the future holds, but we’re ready to protect our people, regardless of the immigration status, the color of their skin or the languages they speak,” said Rep. Dayan Hochman-Vigil (D-Albuquerque). “Because all New Mexicans deserve to feel safe in their communities.”
Advocacy groups push to expand immigrant services, driver protections during session

Much of the news conference focused on the Democrats’ plans for health care amid a statewide doctor shortage that has prompted sharp criticism from Republicans and advocacy groups. 
Martinez and Rep. Reena Szczepanski (D-Santa Fe) described a medical malpractice reform bill that aims to reduce the number of malpractice lawsuits as well as protect doctors from losing their practices if they get sued. 
The bill has not yet been introduced. Rep. Liz Thomson (D-Albuquerque), chair of the House Health and Human Services Committee, told Source New Mexico after the news conference that House lawmakers are still working with the governor’s office on the reforms, which she expects to be wrapped into one piece of legislation. 
Republicans and Senate Democrats are expected to introduce their own legislation on the topic, as well, including measures that will cap the amount of damages that can be paid or raise the standard at which a jury can find health care workers liable for injuries. 
Szczepanski said the bill aims to “make targeted changes to the medical malpractice laws to change the climate that our doctors are practicing in.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7254-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 17:57:34.809138

Condos make up nearly half of the 1,039 short-term rental properties in Stowe, over two-thirds of which are located within the town's six resort complexes.

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in the Stowe Reporter on Jan. 15, 2026.
As the Stowe Selectboard continues to consider a cap on the number of short-term rentals, the town’s major resorts are arguing that they should be exempted from further regulation.
Consideration of a short-term rental cap began last fall, when the planning commission sent a letter to the selectboard recommending such a regulation, but with the exemption of short-term rentals in zoning districts dedicated to the preservation of land owned by resorts like Spruce Peak, Topnotch Resort and von Trapp Family Lodge — properties the planning commission noted were never meant to house year-round Stowe residents.
In a September letter to town manager Charles Safford and shared with the selectboard from assistant manager Will Fricke, condominiums were identified as the predominant housing structure of short-term rentals in Stowe, making up nearly half of the 1,039 rentals that have signed up for the short-term rental registry that went live last May.
Over two-thirds of those condos are located within the six resort complexes: Spruce Peak, Topnotch Resort, Mountainside Resort, Stonybrook, Village Green and Notchbrook, according to Fricke.
Overall, Fricke said, properties in zoning areas designated for skiing and resort operations, which include von Trapp Family Lodge, Spruce Peak and Topnotch, account for 360 short-term rental registrations, which is about one third of total registrations and approximately 60% of units in those zoning areas.
Sam Gaines, president of the Mount Mansfield Company, which manages Spruce Peak, has advocated that short-term rentals at the resort should have been exempted from registry entirely, and they certainly shouldn’t be included in a cap, and if the town wants to install a short-term rental cap, they have little choice but to ensure areas like Spruce Peak are exempt.
“What most people think of when they think of a short-term rental, it’s something that is taking place in a residence, a residential dwelling unit, as opposed to something that’s taking place in a lodging unit, which most people would just consider to be a hotel stay,” Gaines said. “While I’m appreciative of the carve out, I’m not sure that the selectboard has another option.”
AWH Partners, the hospitality group that owns Topnotch Resort, was also eager to ensure its properties were left out. In a letter sent to the selectboard last November, the group wanted to make sure they were exempted alongside timeshares and skiing adjacent complexes like Spruce Peak.
Topnotch is in the midst of constructing new buildings that include 31 new condos, which “are intended to be included in the resort’s hotel inventory when not in use by their owners,” the partnership’s general counsel, Nicholas Mayer, wrote.
“The nature and use of these units has been central to Topnotch Resort’s business plan from the beginning,” Mayer wrote. “Should the Selectboard’s proposed ordinance, as we understand it, not exempt Topnotch Resort from STR limitations, the expansion project will become immediately irretrievably infeasible.”
To avoid this “catastrophe,” Mayer called on the board to exempt them as well.
Selectboard chair Paco Aumand emphasized that discussions of any short-term rental cap are only in the draft stage and still ongoing, but the board is actively looking at determining “which housing units might not develop into long-term housing units if they were further included in an (short-term rental) cap regulation.”
The board will further discuss this potential regulation at a public hearing to be held on Feb. 11 at the Akeley Memorial Building in Stowe.

Splitting rentals
Over half of all condo short-term rentals in Stowe are located at Spruce Peak alone, according to Fricke, and two-thirds of those condos are located at The Lodge at Spruce Peak.
When a visitor to Stowe books a room at The Lodge, the process may not be much different than renting a traditional hotel room. But what they’re really renting is technically a short-term rental.
These rooms aren’t regulated like a short-term rental in a single-family home by the state of Vermont. While stand-alone short rentals have to pay a 3% surcharge tax on their bookings, the Vermont Department of Taxes views rentals within a complex like The Lodge differently, exempting them from the surcharge tax because they’re regulated under the Vermont Department of Health like a traditional hotel.
Fewer than 20% of the condominiums or single-family homes within the Spruce Peak complex but outside of The Lodge are registered as short-term rentals with the town, according to Fricke, and Spruce Peak is far from the only resort or hotel maintaining short-term rentals like traditional hotel rooms, but it is a prime example of the spectrum of short-term rentals operating in nuanced ways in Stowe, both within and adjacent to resort complexes and hotels.
While it’s relatively easy to excise the resorts in zoning areas identified specifically for resort and ski-lodging stays from further regulation, the number of condos being let as short-term rentals while their owners are often elsewhere offers a tougher challenge.
According to Fricke, of the 930 short-term rentals registered without a homestead declaration — meaning the property is maintained as a rental or second home — about 600 are not in either of those zoning areas and are not timeshares.
Condo associations outside of resorts have begun clamoring for their own exemptions. Among the slew of letters protesting any further regulation of short-term rentals from property managers whose livelihood depends on the growth of that market in Stowe, these associations have also written to make their objections heard.
Of the 55 condominium complexes in Stowe, 37 have at least one short-term registered with the town, according to Fricke’s analysis.
A handful of letters sent by owners at the Mountainside Resort, a condo association off Cottage Club Road, make the case that those properties, too, were never intended for year-round residence, were always meant to be rented out while their primary owners were away, would impact the value of real estate throughout the town if not exempted and function similarly to properties being considered for exemption at places like Spruce Peak and Topnotch.
Mark Vandenberg — who is on the board of trustees at Mountainside and owns Sun and Ski Inn, where he operates both traditional hotel rooms and some short-term rentals — reiterated that Mountainside was “never intended for full-time occupancy,” and has operated as a “vacation resort, with a strong emphasis on timeshare until very recently.”
“Furthermore, I’d like to point out that many of our out-of-state owners have owned here for decades — some over 40 years — and paid plenty of property taxes during that period. Is it fair for them to see their unit values crumble as a result of this proposal?” he said.
Charles Stevenson, president of an association representing 32 condo owners adjacent to Stoweflake Resort, also submitted a memo to the selectboard lobbying for exemption from any potential short-term rental cap.
The selectboard still has tools to regulate short-term rentals that have yet to be discussed. An entirely new zoning overlay district could be created to accommodate condo owners concerned about being locked in to simply owning property that could no longer generate income. The question of how a short-term rental designation under a cap regulation could be maintained or transferred in the event of property sale or inheritance is another thorny, open question the selectboard will have to address.
If the selectboard does decide to draw a line on what properties can be rented in the short term, as part of a multi-pronged regulatory effort to make housing in Stowe more accessible to the workers who make Stowe’s hospitality economy run, it’s unlikely that all parties will be pleased.
“I think there’s all types of gray areas, and that’s going to be part of the hard work that the selectboard and planning commission have to do,” Gaines said. “Where do you establish some boundaries that are appropriate, keeping in mind what you’re trying to accomplish.”

(Grant Stringer/States Newsroom)Washington and Oregon will not have to build a drawbridge as part of the project to replace the aging Interstate 5 bridges across the Columbia River, the U.S. Coast Guard decided on Friday.
Instead, the states can go with a less expensive fixed span that provides 116 feet of clearance for vessel traffic on the river below. The savings from this design will be welcome news for the states, which are confronting rising cost estimates for the multibillion-dollar project before construction is even underway.
Coast Guard officials informed elected leaders and transportation officials in the two states Friday. A written decision was expected to follow.
The approval “will eliminate the only stoplight on Interstate 5, put an end to commute interruptions, and save millions in construction costs,” said U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington.
“The vast majority of the maritime community agrees that the new bridge design will not only allow river commerce to continue but also improve safe passage down the river,” added Cantwell, the senior Democrat on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, which oversees the Coast Guard. 
Cantwell had pressed Admiral Kevin E. Lunday, Commandant of the Coast Guard, for a decision by Jan. 16.
Washington state Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, said he was “really excited to see that the Coast Guard listened to the communities. We’re one step closer to getting this bridge replaced.” 
Liias, the chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, said this is “a really critical decision point” that allows planners to drill down on what the bridge might look like and the costs.
The existing bridge is in danger of collapse in a major earthquake, and one of its spans is over a century old. Supporters of the project predict fewer crashes, faster commutes and more transit options when the new bridge is done.
A fixed span has always been the official first choice of Washington and Oregon. Project planners argue a movable span would perpetuate the same issues travelers experience with the existing bridge, including delays, freight bottlenecks and crash risks.
While Friday’s announcement answers one major question, others, such as what the bridge will cost, when construction will begin and when traffic will finally drive on it, remain unknown.
Program managers are looking to get federal government sign-off on environmental review and a record of decision so contracts can be negotiated this year. Once rolling, construction is expected to last until at least 2032.
For the past couple years, project planners have said the price tag for replacing the bridge ranges from $5 billion to $7.5 billion, with the likely figure of around $6 billion. And they’ve said constructing a movable span would be $500 million more than a fixed-span.
In September, legislators said they anticipate the total could reach $10 billion because costs have escalated 30% on transportation projects in the Seattle and Portland regions in recent years. 
Project planners have been recalculating the estimate for months. The work involves examining “100 risk factors,” including inflation and tariffs, staff have said.
Joe Cortright, a Portland economist and project critic, said earlier this month that the revised expense could range between $12.2 billion and $17.7 billion based on public records he obtained and shared with reporters. 
Funding is coming from several sources. Each state has committed about $1 billion. Tolls — which will be imposed in both directions on the existing bridge starting in 2027 and managed by Washington — are relied on for a minimum of $1.2 billion. Oregon has a moratorium on any tolls other than the bridge.
Federal grants totaling $2.1 billion were awarded last year under the Biden administration. Planners are pursuing $1 billion from the Federal Transit Administration’s Capital Investment Program. This would help pay for a 1.9-mile extension of light-rail from North Portland to a future station near Evergreen Boulevard in Vancouver, Washington. A decision on that funding isn’t expected until the project is further along.
The question of cost should become clearer in the coming weeks, Liias said.
“We know it will be more than the resources we have,” he said Friday. “We will have to figure out how we phase it.” 
He has previously said work may need to be delayed on some of the nearly 30 separate items — from new bus shelters to off-ramp improvements — in this endeavor.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/i5-bridge-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-16 17:57:34.809138

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island and Providence education officials say a loan forgiveness program for educators of color is “no longer in effect,” according to documents both organizations filed Friday in response to a U.S. Department of Justice complaint.
Both defendants want the feds’ complaint dismissed and are demanding a trial by jury.
The case began in September 2025 and identified the Educators of Color Loan Forgiveness Program offered by the Providence Public School District (PPSD) as an example of racial discrimination because, in the suit’s words, it “exclud[ed] white teachers” and afforded benefits on the basis of race.
DOJ sues Providence schools over teacher loan forgiveness program it says excluded white hires

With up to $3.175 million in funding pledged by the Rhode Island Foundation, the program started in 2021 and offered up to $25,000 in student debt relief for new district hires who identified as Asian, Black, Indigenous, Latino, biracial, or multiracial. Applicants would need at least $5,000 in debt to participate.
Now, in separate and mostly similar responses to the DOJ complaint, both defendants say the program is defunct, with the phrase “no longer in effect” repeated a total of more than 30 times across both documents.
“The Plaintiff fails to allege facts sufficient to show that it is entitled to recover any damages from RIDE,” the education department’s response reads. “The Plaintiff’s allegations are moot in whole or in part.” 
It’s still unclear exactly when the program ended. When the lawsuit was filed last September, the DOJ alleged that the program “continues to operate on behalf of applicants accepted.” References to the program had been removed from the district’s website in certain places, although publicly cached copies can still be accessed. 
The program lasted until at least the 2024-2025 academic year, according to PPSD’s response Friday. 
The original federal complaint says that “PPSD accepted applications for the Program for at least four school years: School Year 2021-2022, 2022-2023, 2023-2024 and 2024-2025.”
The Providence school district admitted to “the truth of the allegations” in its response. RIDE maintained it was “without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of the allegations” in its own response.
The Justice Department argues the loan forgiveness program violated Title VII by compensating employees differently because of their race. In their formal responses, RIDE and PPSD argue that they acted in good faith.
“RIDE acted reasonably and in good faith and has not violated any established right under the Constitution or laws of the United States or any political subdivision or any act of Congress providing for the protection of civil rights,” the response reads.
The two parties diverge a bit, however, when responding paragraph-by-paragraph to the latter portions of the DOJ’s argument, which detail the mechanics of the loan forgiveness process at the Providence school department.
Providence school officials confirm most of the feds’ timeline and schematics for how the program worked, while the education department — which has controlled the Providence school district since 2019 — repeatedly says it lacks the necessary knowledge to confirm the truth of these allegations.
Both defendants confirmed they were investigated by the DOJ prior to the complaint’s filing.
Providence officials said in September that they were taken aback by the complaint, as they had cooperated with the investigation earlier in 2025. At that time, neither RIDE nor the school district had been formally served.
According to the case docket, the state and city school department were not formally served, and therefore compelled to respond, until early December. 
The defendants had a deadline to respond by Dec. 29, but RIDE and PPSD asked for an extension to file their responses, moving the deadline to Jan. 16. RIDE and PPSD filed their responses Friday.
RIDE and PPSD did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.

(Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)The State Investment Board on Friday approved about $1.3 million in performance bonuses to 12 Retirement and Investment Office staff members.
Two state lawmakers had called on the board to delay the vote, citing unanswered questions about whether the bonuses comply with state law.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who chairs the State Investment Board, on Friday urged the bonuses to move forward, noting an assistant attorney general and legal staff within his office said the payments are legal.
Armstrong said that while he has problems with the structure of the bonus pay program, he doesn’t want to abruptly take back money that was promised to the agency.
“In North Dakota, when we make a deal, we honor it,” he said.
The program, established in 2024, is intended to reward Retirement and Investment Office staff when its internally managed funds outperform the market.
Sen. Sean Cleary, R-Bismarck, and Rep. Mitch Ostlie, R-Jamestown, in letters to the board this week, said the bonuses were based on the performance of funds mostly managed by outside firms on the Retirement and Investment Office’s behalf. They said this appeared to conflict with the statute’s mandate for the additional pay to only be granted if money directly invested by the state agency surpasses revenue benchmarks.
The law doesn’t specify what qualifies as internally managed funding. Armstrong said that while the language of the statute is “opaque,” testimony on the proposal from the 2023 Legislature indicates that the bill’s authors never intended for the program to award bonuses exclusively based on funds managed by Retirement and Investment Office staff. 
The bonuses were approved almost unanimously. Board member Adam Miller was the only no vote.
Seven of the 12 bonuses exceed $100,000 and the largest is $293,000. 
Lawmakers urge investment board to delay action on bonuses, citing lingering questions

The Retirement and Investment Office still has a hand in overseeing money managed by third-party firms, executive director Jodi Smith said during the meeting.
The incentive pay is awarded if the state’s top four funds outperform the market. Those four funds are the Legacy Fund, the Public Employees Retirement System, the Teachers Fund for Retirement and Workforce Safety and Insurance.
Those funds surpassed benchmarks by $191 million between July 1, 2024, and June 30, 2025.
State data indicates only a fraction of the four funds was invested by in-house employees during the period of time the bonuses cover, Cleary wrote in his letter.
Smith said during the meeting that even if the agency were to follow Cleary and Ostlie’s narrow interpretation of the statute, the Retirement and Investment Office’s investments still did well enough to merit the bonuses.
“It doesn’t matter how you do the math,” she said. “Our team succeeded.”
Cleary and Ostlie have also raised concerns that the board lacks continuing authority to appropriate the bonus money. The lawmakers have asked for an attorney general’s opinion on the matter.
Armstrong said that the executive branch has already had internal discussions about changing the bonus pay program in the future.
He said that even though one of the goals of the program was to attract and retain Retirement and Investment Office staff, it hasn’t been effective in reducing turnover.
“Since December of 2024 this agency, had turnover in 11 of 32 positions,” he said. “We have to address base pay to be more competitive with other public funds across the country.”

Since 2020, 36 states have lost at least one rural labor and delivery department.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images) North Carolina will have $213 million in federal funds to spend this year to improve rural health care, and will be eligible for more money each year over the next four years. 
The money for the new “rural health transformation program” is coming from $50 billion that was included in the OBBBA, the massive federal law passed last year that cut taxes and cut Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for people with low incomes. 
The fund is meant to help ease the impact of the cuts on rural areas, where residents have a harder time accessing care and where health care providers are more likely to rely on Medicaid payments than providers in urban areas. 
Every state received money from the rural health fund. The federal government will review states’ progress to determine future funding. Debra Farrington, deputy secretary for health at the NC Dept. of Health and Human Services, said it will be important to demonstrate early wins by delivering immediate and visible benefits to communities.  
“Year-one successes are vitally important,” she said. It’s also critical to use the first year to build momentum toward achieving long-term goals, she added.
During an online discussion Friday about the rural health transformation program rollout, Farrington said North Carolina plans to spend the money on:

Six locally-governed NC ROOTS hubs to connect medical, mental health, and social supports  
Prevention, chronic disease management, maternal health, and nutrition programs  
Increased access to mental health services, including substance use disorder treatment  
The rural health care workforce  
Rural providers’ transition to to value-based care, where providers are paid based on keeping people healthy and out of the hospital rather than on how many services are provided
Enhanced technology in health care through artificial intelligence and expanded broadband access 

“This is really potentially a generational opportunity to invest in the things that we really need to be investing in for our rural communities,”  said NCDHHS state health director Dr. Larry Greenblatt, “things that will make a difference to the individuals living in those communities to improve their health, but also to recruit and support the workforce.”
The federal government is giving states money with one hand, and taking money away with the other.  
“This funding will improve health care delivery for the more than 3 million North Carolina residents who live in rural communities,” Gov. Josh Stein said. 
But, he warned, the same federal legislation that created the rural health transformation program will cost the state tens of billions of dollars in Medicaid funds over the next 10 years. 
“It is without doubt that these cuts will inevitably hit rural communities hard,” despite the rural funding program, he said. 
Stein said his administration will continue to urge Congress to repeal the Medicaid cuts.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/infant.jpg,,,2026-01-16 17:57:34.809138

The justices will consider whether the Environmental Protection Agency’s approval of the Roundup weedkiller without a cancer warning should rule out the state court claims.
The Trump administration has weighed in on Bayer’s behalf, reversing the Biden administration’s position and putting it at odds with some supporters of the Make America Healthy Again agenda who oppose giving the company the legal immunity it seeks.
Some studies associate Roundup’s key ingredient, glyphosate, with cancer, although the EPA has said it is not likely to be carcinogenic to humans when used as directed.
Bayer disputes the cancer claims but has set aside $16 billion to settle cases. At the same time, it has tried to persuade states to pass laws barring the lawsuits. Georgia and North Dakota have done so.
The high court will take up a case from Missouri, in which a jury awarded $1.25 million to a man who developed non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma after spraying Roundup on a community garden in St. Louis.
The Supreme Court in 2022 declined to hear a similar claim from Bayer in a California case that awarded more than $86 million to a married couple.
But Germany-based Bayer, which acquired Roundup maker Monsanto in 2018, contends the Supreme Court should intervene now because lower courts have issued conflicting rulings. In 2024, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Bayer’s favor.
Bayer faces about 181,000 Roundup claims, mostly from residential users. It has stopped using glyphosate in Roundup sold in the U.S. residential lawn and garden market. But glyphosate remains in agricultural products. It’s designed to be used with genetically modified seeds, including corn, soybeans and cotton, that resist the weedkiller’s deadly effect. It allows farmers to produce more while conserving the soil by tilling it less.
Bayer has said it might have to consider pulling glyphosate from U.S. agricultural markets if the lawsuits persist.
“It is time for the U.S. legal system to establish that companies should not be punished under state laws for complying with federal warning label requirements,” Bayer CEO Bill Anderson said in a statement.
Environmental groups said Bayer wants to keep juries out of the lawsuits because it keeps losing in state courts.
“It’s a sad day in America when our highest court agrees to consider depriving thousands of Roundup users suffering from cancer of their day in court,” said Lori Ann Burd, environmental health director at the Center for Biological Diversity.
It’s unclear if the case will be argued in the spring or at the start of the next court term, in October.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26016713345414-1024x684.jpg,,,2026-01-16 17:57:34.809138

Preyer, who joined the board in 2019, was instrumental in founding the North Carolina Collaboratory. He also helped establish the university’s School of Civic Life & Leadership, which was touted by supporters as a model for restoring debate and critical thinking on campus. Faculty critics, however, called the new school a “blatant overreach” by the Board of Trustees and an effort to dictate a more conservative curriculum.

More recently, during his time as board chairman, Preyer was a key figure in helping the university hire former New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick as the university’s head football coach. The team went 4-8 in Belichick’s first season.
Preyer’s term was set to end in 2027.
“I’ve never felt better about the University and its leadership, so now is the time for me to get back to my day job,” wrote Preyer in announcing his departure.
Preyer’s day job is serving as president of Raleigh-based Restoration Systems, an environmental permitting company that specializes in wetland and stream mitigation.
On Thursday, Senate President Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) praised Preyer’s impact.
“John’s tenure on the UNC-Chapel Hill Board of Trustees was defined by incredible reforms,” said Berger on social media. “I’m thankful for his leadership and vision, especially his role in getting the School of Civic Life & Leadership up and running.”
Now it’s up to the UNC Board of Governors to select a replacement to complete Preyer’s term. The Board of Governors is wholly appointed by the Republican-controlled NC General Assembly, and it has been criticized as overly partisan and lacking in diversity.
Governor Josh Stein, a Democrat, said he hoped that partisan politics would not dictate who fills the opening.
“I think the way that the General Assembly has politicized the university system, has politicized the courts, has politicized the Board of Elections – all of this is bad,” said Stein.
Stein called partisan intervention by UNC Boards of Trustees or the Board of Governors “absolutely counterproductive.”
“I think that we would be better served if these were not partisan, but rather they represented the broad representation of the entirety of the state, which includes unaffiliated voters, which includes Democratic voters, which includes Republican voters, not exclusively one party,” said Stein.
There’s no timetable for announcing Preyer’s replacement. UNC-Chapel Hill’s Board of Trustees meets Jan. 21.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Stein_1152026.jpg,,,2026-01-16 17:57:34.809138

In an order from Judge […]","Michigan Capitol | Susan J. DemasUpdated 5:48 p.m.
The state must not spend a portion of the disputed $645 million in state work project funds slashed by the Michigan House Appropriations Committee late last year despite the State Budget Office authorizing departments and agencies to do so, a Michigan Court of Claims judge ruled Friday.
In an order from Judge Michael Gadola, the court ruled that the Michigan House of Representatives and its key committee allocating state funds would suffer irreparable harm if the Michigan State Budget Office “encumbers, expends or otherwise utilizes those funds designated for work projects that were unencumbered within 15 days before the end of the 2025 fiscal year.”
“This harm outweighs the harm an injunction may cause,” Gadola wrote.
The order came after the court heard oral arguments in the matter on Friday morning. Gadola had indicated earlier on Friday that he would rule on the spending matter later next week, which focused on the State Budget Office’s decision to activate spending codes on the work project dollars slashed previously by the House Appropriations Committee. 
The office did so after Attorney General Dana Nessel issued a formal opinion that the cuts to work projects from the Appropriations committee were unconstitutional, bucked the separation of powers doctrine and violated presentment requirements.
Unconstitutional: Nessel says $645M Michigan House GOP project cuts violated separation of powers

Yet, Gadola moved swiftly to opine on the spending matter while the question of constitutionality as it related to Nessel’s opinion was still being resolved.
“The public interest will be served by the entry of this preliminary injunction order,” Gadola wrote.
He further ordered that the budget office’s agents, officers, and employees were immediately enjoined from encumbering, expending, transferring, or otherwise obligating any of the $645 million in unencumbered funds associated with the specific line-item appropriations disapproved as work projects by the House Appropriations Committee on Dec. 10, 2025.
The order did not, however, apply to any funds that were paid out by the budget office as of Sept. 15, 2025.
Michigan Dems say $645M work project cuts are ‘cruel’; GOP’s Rylee Linting also calls foul

The status quo of the order was to be maintained until the court ruled otherwise, with Gadola noting there were other pending questions in the case.
The drastic work project cuts were made by House Republican appropriations chair Rep. Ann Bollin, and championed by House Speaker Matt Hall, who said the money was an area of concern in their push to wipe what they’ve labeled “waste, fraud and abuse” in the budgeting process.
Several of the cuts slashed community services and other projects that residents have come to rely on. Democrats in the state House and Senate unified to call the cuts cruel, and some Republicans joined their repudiation of Hall and Bollin.

Nessel said earlier this month that the cuts were accomplished through an unconstitutional process, which led the budget office to start spending the money.
Hall filed a lawsuit almost immediately, the merits of which are still pending before Gadola and the Court of Claims.
The speaker ran a victory lap in a statement following Gadola’s order.
“I’ve said all along that we were going to win this easily, because any fair court would rule in the House Republicans’ favor,” Hall said. “While ultimate Lansing insiders and Senate Democrats are desperate to protect their pork spending, House Republicans are fighting for hardworking taxpayers. This ruling has stopped Dana Nessel’s bogus legal opinion in its tracks, forcing the Whitmer administration to stop illegally spending their slush fund dollars.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-16 21:59:13+00:00,CT Mirror,Lawmakers question DOC leaders after audit flagged shortcomings,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/16/lawmakers-question-doc-leaders-after-audit-flagged-shortcomings/,Connecticut legislative leaders said they're concerned about findings in a recent audit report showing failures by state prison staff.,"Lawmakers said they’re concerned about findings in a recent audit report showing failures by state prison staff to distribute medications on time, inform individuals who were released about money left in their accounts, and provide proper training for employees. 
An audit report released in July, which reviewed the years 2022 and 2023, found the Connecticut Department of Correction had administered medications to incarcerated individuals late — or, in some cases, not administered them at all. A review of medications given out to 10 people showed delays roughly 10% of the time. 
“This could really put inmates and correction officers in danger for folks not receiving their medication,” Rep. Lucy Dathan, D-New Canaan, said during a forum at the Capitol on Friday.
Dathan is co-chair of the legislature’s Government Oversight Committee, which convened the forum, along with the Judiciary Committee to discuss the audit. Lawmakers at the forum also raised concerns with the functioning of the state’s correctional health care system as a whole. 
Rep. Steve Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, who co-chairs the Judiciary Committee, said the legislature has heard for years about problems with medical care for incarcerated men and women. He said he wanted to see data from the department showing improvement. 
“Frankly, I don’t know what else we can do to track that we’re getting better. I don’t see that we’re getting better. And maybe we are. But I would like the data to back that up,” said Stafstrom. 
DOC Commissioner Angel Quiros told lawmakers Friday that the department has struggled to fill positions for nurses and prescribers. That was the case in 2022 and 2023, and it’s still the case, he said. Quiros said the state’s nursing ranks declined during the pandemic and DOC is competing with other health care facilities — like hospitals, which offer better pay — for a limited number of providers.
That may have resulted in there not being enough nurses to distribute medication, Quiros said.
Robert Richardson, chief operating officer for DOC’s health services, said the department changed its policies to allow for a larger window of time when medication could be distributed. He said nurses were coached on the importance of documenting any delays. The electronic health records system now allows for exceptions for “exigent circumstances” that might cause delays in medication distribution, such as a facility lockdown. 
Stafstrom said he wanted to receive a direct report monthly on the doses of medicine delivered and the percentage of compliance, so he could track whether compliance was increasing or decreasing over time. 
Sen. Sujata Gadkar-Wilcox, D-Bridgeport, said she felt there needed to be a way to prioritize individuals with serious conditions for whom delays in medication could lead to significant health risks. 
“ There could be certain medications, [that] when they’re missed even by an hour, could be critical for a patient,” she said. 
In a press conference in advance of the hearing, advocates called for heightened scrutiny on medical care for inmates, particularly in light of the deaths of Tyler Cole and Ronald Johnson, who died from an overdose of methadone and other prescribed medications while incarcerated at Garner Correctional Institution. 
“We will never know how many deaths in custody actually resulted from misdiagnosis and overdosing clients without adequate professional oversight,” said Barbara Fair, executive director of Stop Solitary CT. “Incarceration was not meant to be a death sentence, and yet countless people have died in just the last five years.”
State auditors are in the process of completing a performance audit with a specific focus on medical care for incarcerated men and women. 
Other findings
According to the audit, DOC continued to hold money that had belonged to individuals who had been released from prison. As of August 2024, there were 7,813 inactive accounts that held a total of about $483,000, according to the report.
Several lawmakers pointed out that the money, which had been held in commissary accounts while the person was incarcerated, could be critical for someone who was newly released from prison.  
“Most of the inmates are going to be released at some point in time, and we want them to be good upright, law-abiding tax paying citizens,” said Sen. John Kissel, R-Enfield, ranking member on the Judiciary Committee. “In this day and age, any dollars in your pocket are going to be helpful, and there’s just no real reason why someone should not be alerted as they’re walking out the door, ‘Hey, you’ve got $500 coming to you.’” 
The audit also found lapses in training for DOC employees. Auditors said 19 of the 20 employees’ training they reviewed did not meet requirements. Employees must have 16 hours of training per year if they don’t have direct contact with incarcerated individuals, and 40 hours per year if they do work directly with the incarcerated population. 
Quiros said he had raised the requirement for in-person training from 8 to 24 hours and reduced the amount of training on computers at individual facilities. He said training numbers had improved in recent years, but were not at the levels he would like to see. He estimated that at each facility, between 88% and 100% of staff who work directly with the population had completed required training. 
Costly leaves of absence and overtime
A series of extended administrative leaves of absence among DOC employees also drew the attention of lawmakers. Several expressed concerned about the amount of money being paid to employees under investigation for misconduct or awaiting criminal charges.
The report found that, while paid leave is capped at two months, nine employees remained on administrative leave for over a year. In at least one case, it lasted for over three and a half years. 
Together, the department paid these nine employees more than $800,000 during the time they spent on administrative leave beyond the permitted 60 days. 
According to the Department of Correction, most of the employees who are on administrative leave are either under investigation for use of force, under investigation for “undue familiarity” — usually for bringing contraband into a facility — or have been arrested for a felony outside of work. 
The department attributed the lengthy periods of paid leave to delays in investigations. 
Dathan questioned why someone with pending charges could not be brought back and placed on an administrative desk duty rather than being paid while not doing any work. 
Quiros told lawmakers that there were 26 individuals currently on administrative leave, a decrease from 61 in August. He said he had been bringing people back to work who were awaiting trial proceedings for felony charges. In some cases, he said, the delays were caused by lengthy court procedures.
Quiros said that of the people who were on administrative leave, he estimated that about half would return to the department and half would be dismissed, depending on the severity of the charges.
Lawmakers also took issue with overtime pay. According to the audit, DOC spent $96.6 million on overtime hours in 2022 and $103.4 million in 2023. The audit found that a number of employees who were ineligible for overtime were paid a total of $81,500 in those two years. 
State Auditor John Geragosian said understaffing puts both the correction officers and incarcerated men and women at risk, which can lead to more people being injured and receiving workers’ compensation. 
According to Quiros, about 300 people completed training for correction officers at the academy in 2025, and the department was preparing to hire 100 people. But Quiros also noted that during that time, 287 people had left the department for various reasons. He said the department plans to bring on 300 more correction officers, filling between 92% and 93% of the open positions for officers.
But Quiros noted that even with every position filled, there are situations where overtime was necessary. He said the number of people on leave for workers’ compensation has been rising. In December, the department had about 200 people on workers’ compensation leave for more than a month and another 230 out on short-term leave.
“ Just throwing more resources into getting more correctional officers may decrease the amount of overtime. [It] will definitely decrease the facility emergency lockdowns that we have for lack of staff,” said Quiros. “But we’re still going to have the problem that, anytime a correctional officer is off on accrued time, it generates overtime.” 
State Auditor Craig Miner noted that there had been a wave of retirements within state government shortly before the audited time period. He said there was likely a high number of new employees at the department in those years, and that the findings of the audits might be more concerning if they were to continue in the future. 
But lawmakers expressed frustration over what they saw as persistent problems.
Rep. Renee LaMark Muir, D-Deep River, questioned whether the addition of more correction officers would really solve the problems. She said the department had the same number of officers as it had in 2010, despite having closed multiple facilities and decreased the number of people incarcerated. 
“It’s not just simply throwing more staff at the problem, it’s stepping back and fixing the management problems,” said LaMark Muir. LaMark Muir said she wanted to see a staffing analysis done. 
Quiros said he was open to the idea. Currently, he said, the department has nearly 500 vacancies. 
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, urged Quiros to ask the legislature this year for funding to create a better system. 
“ I need an ask that is visionary. I need an ask that has a vision for a prison system that works for everyone in the prison system,” said Winfield.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Quiros-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 17:57:34.809138

Crowley, who launched his campaign in September, has raised $800,949, including $789,281 in donations and $11,666 in in-kind contributions. About $138,000 was transferred to his governor’s campaign from his county executive campaign committee account. 
According to his campaign finance report, he spent $187,529 and finished the period with $602,181 cash on hand. Seven contributors gave the maximum $20,000 donation allowed in the governor’s race, including executive of the Milwaukee Bucks Alex Lasry. 
“People across Wisconsin are feeling the financial squeeze, and they want a governor who knows how to get things done,” Crowley said in a statement. He said the support is providing him “the resources to build a serious, statewide operation focused on delivering results for working families.”
Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, who launched her campaign in July becoming the first Democratic candidate in the race, raised $618,284 in donations and $2,034 in in-kind contributions. She spent $174,894 and ended the period with $603,075. 
The Democratic Lt. Governors Association pledged in October to invest $2 million in independent expenditures in 2026 to support Rodriguez’s campaign. She listed a $86,000 contribution from the PAC. 
Former Department of Administration Sec. Joel Brennan, the latest candidate to launch a campaign, reported raising $566,212 in donations and $1,610 in in-kind contributions. He spent $13,873 and reported having $552,339 on hand at the end of the period. 
Former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes raised $555,647 since launching his campaign on Dec. 2 from 3,790 donations. He spent $88,265 and ended the period with $471,471. Shortly after launching his campaign, Barnes said his fundraising goal is $50 million over the course of his campaign.
According to his campaign finance report, he received donations of the maximum $20,000 from megadonors George and Alexander Soros. 
Former Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation CEO Missy Hughes reported raising $465,403 and $13,681 in in-kind donations. She spent $63,059 and ended the period with $402,344 on hand. 
State Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison), a Democratic socialist, raised $368,685 in donations and $1,188 from in-kind contributions, though she also spent a majority of the funds during the period. According to her report, Hong spent $234,782 during the period and ended it with $134,588 on hand.
Hong’s fundraising came from over 7,300 donors. According to her campaign, the average donation was $49.96 and about 75% of the total dollars raised came from donors in Wisconsin.
State Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) raised $355,455 in donations and $23,132 from in-kind contributions during the period. According to her report, she spent $84,930 and reported having $334,032 on hand.
Roys reported four donations of the maximum $20,000, including from her husband and Peter Gunder, a former executive at American Family Insurance, and his wife. 
In a statement, Roys’ campaign said that about 82% of the donations to her campaign came from Wisconsin residents and that she isn’t accepting corporate donations. 
“Kelda’s campaign is funded by grassroots donors from every corner of the state. With our disciplined financial management and a committed Wisconsin donor base that is growing every day, Kelda will have the resources necessary to win the primary on August 11,” Roys’ campaign manager Jasper Bernstein said in a statement. 
Tiffany leads Schoemann in fundraising
Tiffany, who launched his campaign in September, led the field of GOP candidates, reported over $2 million raised — raising the most of any candidate in the Democratic or Republican field. The Republican primary field is much smaller than the Democratic field with only two candidates.
According to his campaign finance report, Tiffany raised $2,122,489 in donations and also received $3,808 in in-kind contributions. He spent $438,160 and ended the period with $1,695,038 on-hand. 
Tiffany also received $20,000 each from Republican megadonors Diane Hendricks, Dick Uihlein and Liz Uihlein. 
The largest donation Tiffany reported was $86,000 from the Wisconsin Federation of College Republicans. Wisconsin state law allows for unlimited donations from political parties to candidates.The College Republicans, who boasted raising over $1 million, had received $500,000 from the Uihleins.
Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann, who launched his campaign in early May, reported raising nearly $1 million over the course of the year.
During the reporting period from July to December, he brought in $535,650 in donations and $3,649 in in-kind donations. He spent $381,394 during the period and ended it with $492,495 in-hand.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderLegislators, religious leaders and community members gathered at Georgia’s state Capitol in Atlanta Friday to commemorate civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. the day after what would have been his 97th birthday. 
The ceremony, held amid a nationwide backlash to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and growing calls for increased affordability, highlighted King’s efforts to fight for racial equality and economic justice.
In this year’s keynote address, John Hope Bryant, the founder, CEO and chair of Operation HOPE, highlighted King’s efforts to expand economic empowerment, calling him the “embodiment” of what it means to have financial freedom.

King’s family was able to send him to the historically Black Morehouse College in Atlanta when he was 15 years old in the 1940s. He would go on to earn advanced degrees.  
“That took economic freedom. That took the ability to have a voice,” Bryant said. 
Bryant also called on lawmakers, advocates and everyday Georgians to work toward improving financial literacy, calling it “the civil rights issue of this generation.”
“What good is it to get the lunch counter access if you can’t pay the bill for the burger?” he said.
The ceremony was also attended by some of King’s surviving family members, the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus and other elected officials.
Government facilities across the state will be closed Monday in observance of King’s birthday, celebrated every third Monday in January. In 1968, King was slain at the age of 39 after becoming the face of the nonviolent Civil Rights Movement fighting the systemic racism Black people endured across the deep South and other parts of America.
But this year, the celebration for some might look slightly different: visitors to national parks across the nation will no longer be granted free access on Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday after the U.S. Department of the Interior removed the holiday from the calendar of fee-free days. Free access to national parks was also revoked on Juneteenth, a holiday that commemorates the official end of slavery in America.
Trump has also recently made comments to the New York Times criticizing the Civil Rights Movement, claiming that it led to white people being “very badly treated.”
But in Georgia, where King was born and lived for much of his life, representatives from both sides of the aisle were united in commemorating his birthday. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp celebrated King’s advocacy and legacy of nonviolence in his remarks to the crowd Friday.
“It goes without saying that one of the towering figures of America’s rich history is Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,” Kemp said. “He did as much — if not more than anyone — to ensure we work toward fulfilling those founding principles that inspired the very birth of the United States: liberty, truth and justice for all.”
Sen. Nikki Merritt, a Grayson Democrat and chair of the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus, spoke at a ceremony celebrating the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder
Sen. Nikki Merritt, a Grayson Democrat and chair of the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus, urged attendees to continue fighting for King’s message of equality.
“Dr. King envisioned a world where children of all backgrounds could join hands as equals, and that vision is not a relic of the past,” Merritt said. “It is a living challenge to each of us every day.”
MLK Day celebrations across metro Atlanta will continue throughout the weekend, with a commemorative service at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King once served as a pastor, as well as a parade, a 5K race, and numerous community service events.

(Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Leaders of the two federally-recognized tribes in Colorado spoke to the Legislature on Friday morning about the relationship between state and tribal governments, as well as a desire to further confer on policy proposals at the Capitol.
“In many places, state and tribal relations remain strained. But here in Colorado, we have chosen a different path,” said Southern Ute Indian Tribe Chairman Melvin Baker. “It is one rooted in collaboration, consultation and trust.”
Leaders of the Southern Ute Indian Tribe and Ute Mountain Ute Tribe address the Legislature at the beginning of the session every year about their priorities, successes and challenges. The Southern Ute Reservation and Ute Mountain Ute reservations sit next to each other in the southwest corner of the state and have about 3,600 enrolled members combined.

Ute Mountain Tribe Councilmember Marilynn House said that she would like for tribes to formally meet with legislators more often. Tribal consultation is usually honored, she said, but is not always consistent.
“Open communication is what all tribes in this country should have and be entitled to, as the government has broken many promises and treaties,” she said. “A way to move forward from the past would be to always consult the tribes.”
House highlighted recently-passed legislation related to tribes, such as last year’s Colorado Voting Rights Act, which enables members to use their tribal identification cards for voter registration and requires drop boxes on reservation land if the tribe requests one.
“This allowed more access to voting for our tribal membership and provided the tribe with an opportunity to be involved in their state’s elections and have proper representation,” she said.
She also praised a law passed last year that gives tribal members free access to state parks. That law is the center of a lawsuit from the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation in Utah, which alleges they also have longstanding rights to hunt, fish and access the lands now considered state parks in Colorado.
Baker used a portion of his speech to call on the state to help more with cleanup efforts from a major gasoline spill on the reservation over a year ago. An estimated 97,000 gallons of gasoline spilled from a ruptured pipeline owned by Texas-based Enterprise Products in December 2024. It is the largest spill in the state since 2016.
“This presence of gasoline contamination in the groundwater raises serious concerns for public health, environmental safety and long-term impacts to the Animas River, our wildlife, our reservation, our cultural resources and those who live downstream,” he said.
He said the spill is a reminder of the risk posed by aging infrastructure and weak oversight, and the state has not allocated “appropriate” resources to the cleanup, he said. Late last year, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it would work with the tribe and the state to implement a corrective action plan.
“We believe that if a similar spill occurred on the Front Range, the response would be immediate and direct,” he said.
Baker also said the tribe has entered into mediation with the state over the tribe’s ability to launch an online sportsbook without being subject to a 10% tax, which the tribe said is not allowed under the state’s gaming compact with the tribes. Colorado voters legalized sports betting in 2019. The tribe sued the state over the issue in 2024 — the Ute Mountain Ute tribe joined the lawsuit later — but a federal judge ruled that the state is immune to the lawsuit late last year.
“Our relationship depends on cooperation,” he said. “We need to enter into agreements with the state and trust that they will be respected.”

(Photo by Getty Images, board seal courtesy the State of Iowa) The Iowa Board of Medicine has issued an emergency order suspending the license of a Des Moines surgeon accused of posing an immediate danger to the public.
In recent years, the surgeon, Dr. Qasim L. Chaudhry, has faced three lawsuits alleging negligence and medical malpractice. State records indicate the suspension of Chaudhry’s license stems from two separate board investigations that were launched in 2023 and 2024.
In public filings, the board alleges it has received complaints related to Chaudhry’s practice of medicine and concluded that he has failed to meet the required standard of care “in multiple patients and that failure led to significant harm” to patients.

Chaudhry, the board says, “poses an immediate danger to the public,” adding that it the board finds it is necessary to immediately suspend Chaudhry’s medical license through an emergency adjudicative order.
The suspension is “necessary to protect the public health, safety, or welfare until this case is resolved due the severity of the potential consequences of (Chaudhry) practicing medicine in a surgical or clinical setting,” the board stated, adding the imposition of any other “interim safeguards would not be sufficient to protect the public.”
Chaudhry is charged with professional incompetence and with knowingly making misleading, deceptive, untrue, or fraudulent representations in the practice of medicine.
The board has not publicly disclosed the alleged conduct that has given rise to the allegations and charges but has stated that Chaudhry is a “surgeon who practiced in the Des Moines area at all times relevant” to the emergency order.
A disciplinary hearing in the case is scheduled for Feb. 5 and 6, 2026.
Chaudhry has been an Iowa-licensed physician since June 2010. His practice specialty, according to board records, is transplant surgery.
The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Chaudhry for comment.
Three medical malpractice lawsuits
The board’s comes order comes four weeks after a medical malpractice and wrongful death case against Chaudhry and Iowa Methodist Medical Center was dropped by the plaintiffs after an out-of-court settlement was reached.
In that case, the estate of the late Donna Burton of Des Moines alleged Chaudhry performed a hernia repair on Burton on Nov. 23, 2020. Six days later, Burton allegedly went to the Iowa Methodist Medical Center emergency room to report that she was in pain, had not had a bowel movement since the operation, and was vomiting two or three times per day. She was allegedly admitted to the hospital and was found in her room the next morning, vomiting and gasping for air. She died minutes later, the lawsuit alleged, due to a bowel obstruction.
Prior to the settlement in the case, Chaudhry and the other defendants denied any wrongdoing.
In February 2025, Chaudhry and Iowa Methodist Medical Center were sued for negligence by Jasmine Hart, a 37-year-old woman who underwent a kidney transplant on Feb. 23, 2023. In her lawsuit, Hart alleged Chaudhry observed in his surgical notes that the donor’s kidney was “oozy,” and that after the surgery was completed, Iowa Methodist received a call from the Iowa Donor Network indicating the donor had tested positive for cancer.
The lawsuit claimed Chaudhry then determined the transplanted organ needed to be removed. After that operation was completed, Hart resumed dialysis and underwent regular cancer screenings as a result of her exposure to the cancerous donor organ, the lawsuit alleged.
In December 2023, Hart was allegedly diagnosed with kidney cancer. The cancerous kidney was removed, but Hart continued to suffer from nerve damage and pain as a result of the operations, the lawsuit claimed.
Chaudhry and the other defendants in the case denied any wrongdoing. The lawsuit was dropped by Hart in August 2025, with no reference to any out-of-court settlement that may have been reached.
In May 2025, Chaudhry and Iowa Methodist Medical Center were the focus of a third lawsuit alleging medical malpractice. In that case, the estate of the late Faye Jean Robinson of Waterloo alleged that in May 2023, Chaudhry performed surgery on Robinson to repair a hernia and to remove her kidney and spleen.
After the operation was complete, Chaudhry allegedly left the hospital and Robinson twice went into cardiac arrest and was placed on a ventilator. The lawsuit alleges that a second surgery was planned to repair suspected internal bleeding, but before it took place, Robinson went into cardiac arrest three more times, became “visibly swollen with blood coming from the orifices protruding from her body,” and then died.
Chaudhry and the other defendants in the case have denied any wrongdoing. A trial-setting conference in the case is scheduled for Jan. 29, 2026.

(Photo by Meghan O'Brien/South Dakota Searchlight)A committee of South Dakota lawmakers deadlocked on Friday in Pierre on a bill that would remove an economic development fund from the governor’s exclusive control.
A motion to approve the measure tied on a 4-4 vote with one senator excused due to illness, leaving the bill to potentially be considered again later.
The bill would change how money is awarded from the Future Fund, which receives money from a fee paid by employers. The bill would require any Future Fund award to be approved by a majority vote of the governor-appointed Board of Economic Development, rather than by the governor alone, which is already a requirement of many other funds administered by the Governor’s Office of Economic Development. 
The bill would also require the office to write rules outlining an application process, methods of assessing economic impact, selection criteria, requirements to qualify for a grant, and the process for disbursing awards.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Bill sponsor Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, told the committee the measure is not meant to eliminate the fund, but to add minimum safeguards and transparency. The only specific legal restraint on the fund currently is a state law that says it must be used “for purposes related to research and economic development for the state.” 
“Under current law, millions of dollars can be committed without mandatory board approval, without a standardized application process, without objective economic impact criteria, and without consistent public reporting,” Howard said. “This is not conservative governance. It’s simply an oversight failure.”
“And we have seen the consequences through the years,” she added. 
The Future Fund has drawn controversy in recent years over former Gov. Kristi Noem’s uses of it, including funding for a shooting range that lawmakers declined to fund, a rodeo where Noem rode in on horseback with the American flag and a workforce development advertising campaign that featured Noem as the star.
Opponents prefer governor’s new executive order
Opponents of the bill included Gov. Larry Rhoden’s economic development commissioner, Bill Even, along with multiple economic development and business organizations. They said the bill would slow South Dakota’s ability to compete for projects by adding bureaucracy and reducing flexibility. 
Even pointed to Rhoden’s recent executive order, signed Thursday, as a better approach, saying it adds transparency while keeping the governor as the decision-maker so the state can “move at the speed of business.” 
Governor pledges transparency in funding decisions that lawmakers might vote to take away

Rhoden’s executive order lays out procedures for how Future Fund awards are handled and requires public posting of awards and agreements, while still preserving the governor’s sole authority over the fund.  
When asked during a Thursday press conference if he’s pushing back against allegations that he and his predecessor improperly used the fund, Rhoden said that’s not the case.
“I think it’s just to put in writing and give the legislators a comfort level that this is what we’re looking at when we’re making these decisions on Future Fund projects,” Rhoden said.
Howard and other supporters of her bill countered that executive orders can be changed or rescinded by future administrations.
The tie vote was on a motion in the Senate State Affairs Committee to send the bill to the full Senate. Sen. Arch Beal, R-Sioux Falls, was excused due to illness, leaving the panel one vote short of the majority needed to advance the bill.
Among the seven committee members who were present, four Republicans voted in favor of the bill and three voted against it. The committee’s only Democrat, Sen. Liz Larson, of Sioux Falls, voted against the bill.
Broader debate over economic development
Separately on Friday, state senators declined to reconsider a nonbinding resolution from Sen. John Carley, R-Piedmont, asserting that “the free market and the private sector, left alone, will best serve our economic interests” without “enticement from tax credits and subsidies.” The Senate rejected the resolution Thursday, and after Carley had announced his intention to seek reconsideration, no reconsideration motion was made Friday.
Howard’s bill and Carley’s resolution are part of a broader discussion this legislative session about economic development in the state. 
Another bill, from Sen. Tim Reed, R-Brookings, would require former state officials or employees to wait for two years before going to work for any entity that was the beneficiary of a contract the officials or employees approved, awarded or administered, if the contract value was more than $1 million. Existing state law requires a one-year waiting period for all such officials or employees.
Reed’s bill is a response to South Dakota Searchlight reporting about Steve Westra, who was the commissioner of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development during the Noem administration. 
Westra left his state job in 2023 and took a job with CJ Schwan’s a year later. While Westra worked for state government, he signed the first pledge of state aid benefiting the company. That aid now totals $69 million of grants, loans and tax rebates for the company’s $550 million, 650-employee food production plant under construction in northern Sioux Falls.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EM8A4379-copy-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 16:57:50.062523

Free.,US Education Department delays plan to garnish wages of student borrowers in default,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-education-department-delays-plan-garnish-wages-student-borrowers-default,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Education, for now, is backtracking on plans to garnish wages and seize tax refunds of student loan borrowers in default, the department announced Friday.Less than a month after the agency said it would begin garnishing wages by sending notices to roughly 1,000 borrowers in default the first full week of January, the department said that the temporary delay would allow it to implement “major student loan repayment reforms” under Republicans’ tax and spending cut bill that President Donald Trump signed into law in 2025.The delay would “give borrowers more options to repay their loans,” the department said. It was not immediately clear from the announcement how long the pause would last. Education Secretary Linda McMahon signaled earlier this week during the Rhode Island portion of her Returning Education to the States Tour that wage garnishment has been “put on pause for a bit.”  The agency resumed collections for defaulted federal student loans in May after a pause that began during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic.A borrower can have their wages garnished as a consequence of defaulting on their loans, and a loanholder can order an employer to withhold up to 15% of their disposable pay to collect defaulted debt without being taken to court, according to Federal Student Aid, an office of the Education Department.The delay also applies to the Treasury Offset Program, which “allows the federal government to collect income tax refunds and certain government benefits (for example, Social Security benefits) from individuals who owe debts to the federal government,” per FSA. Aissa Canchola Bañez, policy director for the advocacy group Protect Borrowers, said in a Friday statement that “after months of pressure and countless horror stories from borrowers, the Trump Administration says it has abandoned plans to snatch working people’s hard-earned money directly from their paychecks and tax refunds simply for falling behind on their student loans.” “Amidst the growing affordability crisis, the Administration’s plans would have been economically reckless and would have risked pushing nearly 9 million defaulted borrowers even further into debt,” she added, while pointing to a Jan. 7 letter from Protect Borrowers and other organizations calling on McMahon to “immediately halt its plan to resume garnishment of millions of struggling borrowers’ wages.”",,,,2026-01-16 16:57:50.062523

Jan. 16, 2025. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. At the year’s first Consensus Revenue Estimating Committee, staff from the House Fiscal Agency, Senate Fiscal Agency and the Michigan Department of Treasury gathered to formalize estimates for economic growth both in Michigan and nationally, as well as state budget forecasts for upcoming fiscal years. 
“My biggest takeaway would be that the economy is stable,” State Treasurer Rachael Eubanks told reporters after the conference. “That’s not to say that there aren’t challenges. There’s a lot of uncertainty at the federal level, but despite that, Michigan has shown resilience and continues to see some growth.”
She added that this growth, fueled in part by revenue performance meeting expectations, allows the state to invest in services and infrastructure now while also planning for the future. 
Looking ahead to the upcoming year’s budget debate, State Budget Director Jen Flood added that, as “the federal government is passing the buck and handing the tab to states across the country,” there have been increased pressures on Michigan’s budget — though she expressed confidence in getting a bipartisan budget done on time. 
Flood noted that while some states have had to pull money from emergency “rainy day” funds amid major changes in federal policy, Michigan has continued to make deposits into its own. 
The consensus forecast that was approved during the conference forecast a 0.2% increase in the state’s combined general fund and school aid fund for FY26, a 1.1% increase in FY27 and a 2.4% increase in FY28.

However, those estimates —especially for the general fund — were much lower than the previous estimates for Fiscal Years 2026 and 2027, by about $780 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, than the last consensus forecast in May 2025. 
House Republican leadership took the chance to criticize spending that they considered to be “waste, fraud and abuse,” a refrain that has become common in the GOP through budget discussions. 
House Appropriations Chair Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township) said that she expected the state might have to cut down its budget in the coming year given the lowered revenue predictions. 
“I think that it actually supports our approach to the budget for the current fiscal year, and that we were very prudent, if not preemptive, and what’s ahead for us by taking that budget and going through it line by line and making cuts,” she told reporters after the conference.
House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) similarly cited GOP budget priorities — including the controversial cuts to $645 million in departmental work project spending, the constitutionality of which is currently being debated in court — as the correct response to the forecasts given in the conference. 
“Now, with all the COVID money gone and our $9 billion surplus wasted by the Democrat trifecta, we have a more than $1 billion hole in the next budget,” Hall wrote in a press release. “As I predicted, we now have to keep doing what House Republicans did in this last budget. Eliminate more ghost jobs. Stop the Democrat pork spending. And slash even more waste, fraud, and abuse.”
When asked about those statements, Flood declined to directly respond to the framing used by Bollin and Hall, but said that the results of the conference were “largely expected.”
“These are adjustments from the May CREC, which happened before reconciliation. It happened before the tax policy and budget that we passed in September, October, and so we’re not surprised by this,” she said. “The Fiscal Year 26 budget accounts for these changes, and we look forward to working with Republicans and Democrats in the legislature to finalize another balanced budget by June of this year.”
However, Michigan Senate Appropriations Chair Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing) said Democrats had fought to make responsible investments in the state’s rainy-day fund. 
“As revenue growth flattens, we will remain committed to governing with discipline and maturity, always keeping the needs of the people and the financial health of the state top of mind,” Anthony said in a press release after the conference. “Thanks to smart investments and the extremely accurate forecasting of our state economists, I am confident in our state’s ability to create another fiscally responsible budget that delivers real results for the people of Michigan.” 
The budget analysts also provided more general forecasts for the economy in Michigan and the United States for the next three years. 
Unemployment rates for Michigan were predicted to stay relatively flat, between 5.3% and 5.6% — slightly higher than the national predictions, which sit around 4.8%. 
Those predictions aligned generally with a presentation from researchers at the Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics at the University of Michigan. 
Gabriel Ehrlich, the director of the program, explained that Michigan’s unemployment rate has actually dropped since last April, despite the national rate increasing slightly — even though statewide, the number of employed state residents is falling. 
What that indicates is a declining labor force participation rate, even as the labor market in Michigan remains fairly tight — “the reasons for the decline in the unemployment rate aren’t necessarily the reasons we prefer to see,” Ehrlich said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC_3701-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 16:57:50.062523

It has been 25 years since I lived in Jackson, Mississippi, and whenever someone finds out I’m Jewish and from there, their first response is usually, Wait, there are Jews in Mississippi?
I am proud to always answer yes.
Beth Israel Congregation in Jackson, and the loving community that calls it home, shaped me into the person I am today.
My family has been part of that community for decades. My grandfather and father served as temple presidents; my mom grew up in the community and later served as sisterhood president.
I have vivid memories of my grandmother walking up and down the aisles during Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, asking people if they had somewhere to go and inviting dozens back to her house to make sure no one observed the holidays alone.
Beth Israel was where my parents were married. It was where my sister and I both became Bat Mitzvahs, where we formed our Jewish identity through religious school and participation in our small but mighty youth group. It was where my husband and I married.

Last Saturday, Beth Israel Congregation was set on fire by someone who hates Jews simply for being Jews. Seeing the charred images of the library is painful. I have vivid memories of being in that library playing hide-and-seek, participating in classes and youth group meetings, getting ready for my wedding  and signing my ketubah in that room.
If I close my eyes, I can see the ark where the Torahs—now reduced to ash—once sat. I can see the books lining the walls that held our community’s history. I remember showing my children the plaques commemorating congregants’ milestones, including several from my own family, which have now been reduced to debris.
Growing up Jewish in Jackson made me a member of two diaspora communities – the Jewish one and the Mississippi one. In the aftermath of the fire, I have received messages from many people who are part of my Mississippi diaspora—some Jewish, mostly not—who have beautiful memories of visiting Beth Israel with me. 
For many of my friends, Beth Israel and my family were the only meaningful encounters with Jews they have ever had, and this fire has affected them in ways they did not expect.
This is not the first time Beth Israel has been targeted. In September 1967, the Ku Klux Klan firebombed the synagogue in retaliation for Rabbi Perry Nussbaum’s support of the Civil Rights movement. I grew up always knowing it was part of my community’s history.
What history books rarely emphasize is how that bombing brought the Jackson faith community together. In its aftermath, white and Black clergy were among the first to condemn the hatred, and members of the Jewish community played a significant role working secretly to help uncover the KKK bombings of the 1960s.
Last week’s fire was not an isolated incident. It is the most recent symptom of the dangerous rise in antisemitism facing Jewish communities across the country and around the world. Since the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, the European Jewish Congress reports at least 20 attacks on synagogues across the globe. 
Jews make up less than 2% of the U.S. population, yet we are the targets of roughly 16% of all hate crimes and nearly 70% of religion-based hate crimes, according to the FBI. American Jewish Committee’s State of Antisemitism in America 2024 report found that 56% of American Jews have altered their behavior out of fear of antisemitism, and 1 in 3 has personally experienced it. Each one of these statistics is a person — a mom or dad, a brother, sister or child.

These troubling numbers highlight why antisemitism is not just a Jewish problem to solve. We need people to listen when we explain why antisemitic violence must be confronted clearly, forcefully and without hesitation. Our fear — rooted in generational trauma — of rising hateful rhetoric from all sides of the political spectrum is real and has consequences.  We need allies who refuse to look away and choose to stand up and take action.
That was apparent last May, when I was staffing an American Jewish Community event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., in which Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky were murdered after leaving the event.
The event was devoted to how grassroots diplomacy can transform the Middle East through humanitarian aid and cross-cultural collaboration. Many of the more than 100 people there were not Jewish. But they came together in a time of need, unified in purpose and in hope. 
A few months later, a German journalist asked me how I can stay optimistic despite that horrible night. That wasn’t a question I have ever considered. Growing up Jewish in Mississippi has always meant that optimism is the only option.
Being a part of Beth Israel taught me many things, most importantly that community is an antidote to many of the problems of the world, that Jewish joy is always stronger than hate, and that showing up for people in their time of need is often the holiest thing you can do. Jews in Mississippi – and pretty much anywhere else, for that matter – need that help more than ever.

Meanwhile, attorneys for the State of Montana said the challenge to these laws should be dismissed.
In a court hearing Thursday afternoon in the Lewis and Clark County District Court, Judge Christopher Abbott heard oral arguments about when parents must be notified. EmpowerMT and the ACLU told the judge that two laws are overly broad, unconstitutional, and violate rights to privacy and a quality education. 
The lawsuit centers on Senate Bill 99, passed in 2021. The lawsuit was also updated to include House Bill 471, passed during the 2025 session, which an attorney for the state said was intended to fix issues stemming from SB 99.
It’s unclear, the complaint says, what teachers and school counselors are allowed to say and do in school, what books they are allowed to assign and even what they can do if a child asks a question about gender identity or sexual orientation. 
“As a result of SB 99 and the Defendants’ efforts to marginalize 2S-LGBTQIA+ students, a hostile environment has been created in Montana public schools that threatens 2S-LGBTQIA+ students,” the complaint reads. “The requirement that all teaching or presentations that reference gender related issues and human sexuality first be reviewed by parents along with the related prohibition on teaching these topics in the absence of parental notice, does a serious disservice to all Montana students.”
Legislators tried to pass a bill in 2023 in an attempt to adjust SB 99, with Rep. Kerri Seekins-Crowe, a Billings Republican, saying some schools sent out notices once per year, while others would send them out daily. Attorneys for the ACLU pointed to the broadness of the law in their arguments.
The worry among school counselors as well is whether they could be potentially revealing information a child does not want their parents to know and potentially opening the child up to problems at home if counselors inform the parents they’d like to talk about a topic with their child. By not being able to provide some help to a student, there is concern that it’s also impacting their educational experience.
​​”Even before enactment of HB 471, school counselors report that they are routinely required to choose between violating SB 99 or breaching their ethical obligations, which require them to maintain confidentiality with students,” the complaint reads. “School counselors routinely meet with students to discuss or confer on issues related to gender identity or sexual orientation. Many students do not feel safe sharing that same confidential information with their parents, yet this is what SB 99 requires, regardless of whether students or counselors consent to such disclosures.”
It could also be confusing for teachers who might have a partner the same sex as them — for example: Does mentioning their relationship constitute a violation of the law?
“We’re talking about anything that has to do with a human being, because we’re talking about gender identity and sexual orientation anytime we acknowledge I’m a woman, I’m cisgender woman who’s married to a man, that’s talking about my sexual orientation and gender identity,” Ashlee Rossler, an ACLU Montana attorney, said during during arguments.
Attorneys for the state argued anyone with a state contract is expected to “promote government speech.”
“Any service that a school counselor provides is done in accordance with the contract with the school district,” said George Clark, a state attorney. “That is government speech that they are giving to the student under the guise of advice.”
He added in his rebuttal: “I don’t think a privacy right includes conversations with a government employee.”
Clark also said that he thinks there is a workaround for school counselors.
“The counselor doesn’t have to say, ‘Hey, your kid came to me. He thinks he’s gay. I need to talk to him about this,’” Clark said. “The counselor just has to say, your son approached me. He expressed some concerns. I want to ensure I’m complying with the law. Do you give me permission to discuss with him, you know any topics related to HB 471, under SB 99.”
The short title of HB 471 is “Revise education laws related to human sexuality and identity instruction” and for SB 99, it’s “Establish parameters for K-12 human sexuality education.” 
Montana legislators also tried to push through a bill allowing religious leaders to become school counselors, though that bill from Sen. Theresa Manzella, R-Hamilton, failed.
“Classrooms and learning spaces are supposed to support expansive and imaginative thinking. They’re not supposed to be limited by the whims of parents and legislators who are injecting their faith-based beliefs into curriculum,” Rossler said. “Especially given that parents do have a role in their child’s education, they have an opportunity every single year to democratically elect their school boards.”
Religious organizations, including the Montana Family Foundation, lobbied in support of HB 471. Clark called injecting religion into the case was “unfair” though a belief among some Christians that being gay is a sin is clearly present in the Montana Legislature and some legislators have used the Bible to justify proposed legislation targeting the state’s LGBTQ community. 
The lawsuit also mentions the inclusion of certain religious values into public education. According to 2024 report by the Public Religion Research Institute, only two major religious groups lack majority support for same-sex marriage, Hispanic Protestants and white evangelical Protestants.
“SB 99’s sponsor, Sen. Cary Smith, explained that the purpose of SB 99 is to reinforce ‘Christian values’ in Montana public education,” the complaint reads.
Clark added there’s due process for teachers and that they have a code of conduct they’re required to follow. Teachers found in violation of the law would have consequences, he added.
“Just like a teacher can be fired for showing a child pornography, a teacher can be fired for disobeying the law,” Clark said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/B86A4213-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 16:57:50.062523

The $5 million proposal would staunch the loss of housing vouchers this year, but is much less than housing authorities had requested.

David Littlefield / Vermont Public
This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
With federal funds dwindling for a key housing assistance program, Vermont lawmakers are looking at using state money to slow the loss of vouchers that help thousands of Vermonters cover rent. 
Legislators have said they want to earmark $5 million in a mid-year spending package to soften the blow of funding reductions to the Section 8 program. The bill has plenty more hurdles to clear, but a key housing panel registered its support for the funds on Thursday after local public housing authorities have spent months crying for help.

Still, the earmark falls far short of the $18 million housing authority leaders had originally bid for last fall, an amount that would have maxed out Vermont’s voucher ceiling set by the feds and boosted the number of vouchers in rotation.
“What we’re trying to do with this one-time, strategic intervention is to…slow the decrease in the number of vouchers in this calendar year as much as possible,” said Rep. Marc Mihaly, D-Calais, who chairs the House General and Housing Committee.
As Vermont faces steep housing costs and persistently high levels of homelessness, federal housing vouchers play a crucial role in sustaining housing for low-income people who can’t afford market-rate rents. Voucher recipients pay a third of their income toward rent; a local agency administering the federal program pays for the rest. The vouchers offer one of the few avenues out of homelessness for the thousands of Vermonters sleeping in shelters, motels and outdoors.
But over the last year, local housing authorities in Vermont have seen reductions in funding from Congress. That has led many of the nine local authorities to stop issuing new vouchers off their lengthy waiting lists, rescind vouchers from people looking for an apartment to use them, and shelve vouchers when tenants have died or moved out. The state lost hundreds of housing vouchers in 2025 through attrition.
Still, many of the nine Vermont housing authorities are entering 2026 in a budget shortfall which they don’t expect to ease anytime soon. Berk is now worried VSHA might need to take the extraordinary step of withdrawing vouchers from people currently using them to help pay their rent if the state does not intervene.
Draft bills in Congress would result in the loss of roughly 300 to 600 more vouchers in Vermont – or $3.6 million to $7.2 million – according to Berk.
“Preserving housing assistance and keeping Vermont families stably housed has to be a priority,” Berk told lawmakers Thursday.
The federal government bases future years’ Section 8 voucher funding on past years’ spending by local housing authorities. That means that as Vermont authorities shrink their voucher rolls, they can expect to receive less money in the future even if need remains great, leading to what Berk has called a “downward spiral” in the number of vouchers available to Vermont renters.
The $5 million in state aid is meant to halt that spiral, at least for a year: It would allow Vermont housing authorities to slow down the erosion in the number of vouchers available to Vermont renters and ensure the state gets more federal money in the coming years. 
“It means that we will always get a greater share of whatever [Congress chooses] to give us [in] future years,” Mihaly said.
Rep. Robin Scheu, D-Middlebury, chair of the powerful budget-writing panel in the House, said Friday morning that her committee is looking at the funding ask “very seriously.”
“If the Section 8 voucher goes away, these people will not be able to afford to pay full market value, and if they can’t pay, then they don’t have a place to live,” Scheu said.
The stopgap funding would help local housing authorities offset funding shortfalls and prevent the displacement of families, according to Berk.
The earlier public housing authorities can receive the funding, the more vouchers they can save this calendar year, Mihaly said – hence, lawmakers’ attempt to earmark the funds as part of the mid-year spending bill typically passed in March.
But Republican Gov. Phil Scott’s administration has signaled it wants to hold off and consider the ask as part of the budget for fiscal year 2027, which begins in July.
“[The governor] believes that in the face of federal uncertainty, we should not be appropriating funds without first understanding the full budget picture and weighing all priorities before making those decisions,” said Amanda Wheeler, Scott’s press secretary.
The House Committee on Appropriations is expected to hash out its version of the mid-year spending package over the coming weeks, before the bill is sent to the House floor and then to the Senate.

Lola’s Fine Sauces of West Des Moines is suing EcoIdeas Innovation Inc. of Canada, in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, alleging it has incurred $700,000 in damages due to Ecoldeas’ breach of contract.
In court filings, Lola’s says that for the past 10 years, it has produced a variety of hot sauces and salsas using fresh and unique ingredients. In the process, the company says, it has grown from a farmer’s market stand to a large company that sells its products throughout the nation at retailers such as Target, Walmart and other grocery stores and supermarkets.

In 2023, Lola’s alleges, it attempted to address growing demand for its product by entering into a contract with EcoIdeas to manufacture “mini bottles” of certain Lola’s sauces for distribution to retailers. EcoIdeas allegedly promised it had the ability to meet Lola’s need for more than 1 million units that met stringent production standards.
Lola’s alleges that in 2024, EcoIdeas breached the contract by failing to prepare labels and products in the manner required. As a result, the lawsuit claims, Walmart was forced to remove defective products from shelves, and Lola’s incurred nearly $155,000 in expenses.
In addition, the lawsuit alleges, there were “issues with defective goods and raw materials that were unusable” due to a failure to follow protocols, resulting in an additional $20,000 in losses.
In 2025, issues allegedly arose with Lola’s Mango Scotch Bonnet products. “Several calls, emails, messages, YouTube videos, and complaints came flooding into Lola’s due to a manufacturing issue in which bottles were bubbling, exploding and fermenting,” the lawsuit claims. “Sauce in several of the bottles also was discolored, and the taste was not in line with Lola’s standards.”
Over the years, some brands of hot sauce are known to have had issues with bottles exploding on shelves due to a buildup of gas caused by fermentation in improperly processed sauces.
In the lawsuit, Lola’s states that it “appears that EcoIdeas failed to fill the bottles at correct temperatures and/or utilize a correct bottle-fill process.” Although those issues did not present any food-safety or health risks, the lawsuit alleges, they significantly affected taste and customer satisfaction.
In total, Lola’s alleges it has suffered reputational harm, plus $700,000 in out-of-pocket costs and product-disposal and shipping fees, and has struggled with retailer chargebacks and lost inventory.
According to the lawsuit, EcoIdeas has acknowledged its breach of contract and promised to take remedial action, such as filing an insurance claim and reimbursing Lola’s for losses, but has failed to follow through.
“EcoIdeas is now claiming it has no insurance coverage,” the lawsuit alleges, and it “has not reimbursed Lola’s for any costs.”
EcoIdeas has yet to file a response to the lawsuit, which was filed in Polk County District Court before being transferred this week to U.S. District Court. The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach company officials or their Iowa attorneys on Thursday.

(Photo by Alexis Bonogofsky/U.S. Fish and WIldlife Service)Calling it an attempt to “prioritize profit over people,” the Gwich’in Steering Committee and twelve conservation groups renewed litigation Tuesday to block the federal government’s oil and gas leasing program in Alaska’s National Wildlife Refuge, one of the last vast, untouched habitats in the United States. 
The lawsuit marks the latest chapter in a decades-old dispute over the refuge’s coastal plain, an undeveloped expanse of roughly 1.5 million acres believed to hold billions of barrels of oil.  The area is also the ancestral homeland of two Indigenous groups long at odds about drilling there.  For the Gwich’in, the tundraland is the center of their creation story — “The Sacred Place Where Life Begins.”  For the Inupiat, who own the surface and mineral rights to a portion of the plain, it represents a  promise of prosperity yet to be fulfilled. 
Tuesday’s filing originates from a 2020 complaint entered during President Trump’s first term when he signed a 2017 tax bill that required two oil and gas lease sales for the area.  Characterized then as a leasing program that “flagrantly breaks the law,” Trustees for Alaska, the firm representing the coalition, temporarily paused litigation to re-draft a plan with Biden-era agencies. That resulted in fewer acres to lease in the refuge and called for a sale to be held in January 2025 which drew zero bids.   
In October, the Trump administration re-adopted the initial program and suggested that another auction would happen as soon as this winter.  Meanwhile, seven oil and gas leases, canceled under Biden, were reinstated to the only entity that currently owns leases — the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, the agency that promotes economic development in the state.
The amended lawsuit, in U.S. District Court in Anchorage, now seeks to vacate those leases. 
“AIDEA’s leases were issued unlawfully on a number of grounds, as the Biden Administration acknowledged when cancelling them,” wrote Bridget Psarianos, a senior staff attorney with Trustees for Alaska.  
“The Biden Administration cited violations of the Tax Act as the primary reason for cancelling the leases, the very law that allowed the Leasing Program to be established in the Refuge,” she said in an email Thursday. 
In response to the litigation, AIDEA fired back with a prepared statement on Thursday.  
“Federal law says the Secretary of Interior ‘shall,’ which means ‘must,’ “establish and administer a competitive oil and gas program for the leasing, development, production, and transportation of oil and gas in and from the Coastal Plain” read the statement.  
“The Department of Interior simply does not have the ability or authority to refuse to develop the Coastal Plain.”
The groups joining the Gwich’in Steering Committee’s lawsuit  include a roster of environmental organizations based in Alaska, nationally and in Canada. The Alaska Wilderness League, the Sierra Club, and the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society-Yukon are each named as plaintiffs. 
Together, they are suing the Interior Department and its secretary, Doug Burgum, the Bureau of Land Management, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The lawsuit names seven other intervenor defendants, including the State of Alaska, the Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation, AIDEA and the American Petroleum Corporation, to name a few. 
The debate of whether to drill in the Arctic Refuge has been mired in heated political and legal battles for nearly fifty years. The Gwich’in and Inupiat have long locked horns over the coastal plain. 
Gwich’in beliefs center on a profound, spiritual connection with the Porcupine Caribou Herd that uses the coastal plain, viewing them not just as food, but as integral to Gwich’in identity, culture and survival. 
“The Gwich’in have been fighting–and succeeding–for decades in protecting the calving grounds of the Porcupine Caribou Herd,” said Kristen Moreland, executive director of the Gwich’in Steering Committee in a press release, Tuesday. 
Pro-oil Inupiats, meanwhile, see drilling in the refuge as their sovereign right.  Under the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, commonly referred to as ANCSA, which ceded Native land to the state and organized more than 200 tribes as for-profit corporations, part of the idea was that capitalism through natural resource development would create quality-of-life improvements for impoverished villages.
The Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, which co-owns rights to parts of the greater Prudhoe Bay oilfield, is ANCSA’s most shining example.  In 2024, ASRC earned $5.5 billion in gross revenue, a financial windfall enjoyed by its eight affiliated Alaska Native villages — Kaktovik among them.
“In this modern time, we need the ability to be able to provide jobs and resources for our families,” said Charles Lampe, president of the Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation. 
The tribal leader and whaling captain said he took issue with Gwich’in interference in Inupiat economic affairs, backed by well-funded nonprofits, and especially by those from outside. He pointed out that Kaktovik is the only settlement situated within the coastal plain. 
“It’s unfortunate the way that our two Indigenous tribes have been pitted against each other,” Lampe said. “And the way they’re using that animal — the caribou — as a reason to push back on our Inupiat people, our Inupiat right to be able to provide an economic future for our community.” 
The Gwich’in Steering Committee did not immediately respond to questions addressing that criticism. 
As temperatures in the Arctic continue to warm far faster than the rest of the planet, the Trump administration has been working to commodify Alaska’s natural resources, opening up previously protected waters to oil and gas drilling, and allowing for other contentious projects, such as the 211-mile-long Ambler road to cut through the fragile foothills of the Brooks Range.  
Among these plans is also the repeated promise to ramp up Arctic drilling.  But oil companies have shown little interest in the last two lease sales. As of now, there has been no public notice for another lease sale. 
For AIDEA’s part, the company was seeking professional support to carry out three-dimensional seismic testing of the refuge’s coastal plain, according to a request for proposals posted last summer with an early August deadline. 
The only available seismic data for the area is dated by three decades and was gathered with less-advanced technology. As a result, no one knows how much crude actually lies beneath the plain, though the U.S. Geological Survey estimates it could be anywhere between four-to-11 billion barrels of oil. A more exact read will require heavy trucks with treads to roll across the snowy tundra sending acoustic signals below to detect oil and gas deposits. 
The Gwich’in and others warn in their amended complaint that the heavy equipment could harm maternal polar bears who make their dens and give birth in the snow along the coastal plain.
In its Thursday statement, AIDEA said the Gwich’in lawsuit “misses the mark.” 
“The Coastal Plain represents an estimated $2.3 billion a year from multiple revenue sources to the State of Alaska and royalties to grow and build the Permanent Fund.  Revenue that would be extremely helpful to the State Treasury,” it said.
The case is before U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason who determined, last year, that the Biden administration did not have the legal authority to cancel AIDEA’s leases.

The Together for School Meals coalition spearheaded the ballot measure after lawmakers last year rejected two similar bills that aimed to provide free school meals to students. Instead, lawmakers narrowly expanded the number of families that qualify for free or reduced lunch.
The ballot measure would require public schools to provide free breakfast and lunch to students. Private schools, Bureau of Indian Education schools and other tribal schools could opt in to participate in the program. 
North Dakota lawmakers weigh impact of free school meal proposal

Under Nathe’s bill, the state’s free school meals program would start this fall, while the ballot measure would start the program in fall 2027.
The bill has a $65 million appropriation attached to it for the first year, with funding coming from the state Strategic Investment and Improvements Fund. That figure is on par with what the Department of Public Instruction has estimated the program will cost per year, although the agency has said the cost is difficult to project.
“When we come back in January 2027, we’ll have half a school year under our belt and we’ll see what’s working and what’s not working and we can adjust,” Nathe said. “At that time, we’ll figure out the funding going forward for the next biennium.”
Providing free school meals would provide about $1,000 in savings per student for North Dakota families, said Nick Archuleta, president of ND United and a member of the ballot measure sponsoring committee
“This is everything we’ve asked for, for two legislative sessions in a row,” Archuleta said. “We are absolutely going to support the passage of this.”
Previously, Robin Nelson, chair of the sponsoring committee, said the group remains cautiously optimistic about Nathe’s bill, but will move forward with signature gathering for the proposed ballot measure.
Legislative Management meets at 1 p.m. Tuesday to discuss the school meal proposal and other bills lawmakers plan to pitch for the special session. Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, who chairs that committee, has previously said he is not in favor of relitigating issues the Legislature debated last session.
If the committee does not advance a bill, a lawmaker could still attempt to introduce it from the Senate or House floor. The bill would need support from at least two-thirds of the members to be introduced.

Greg Gianforte formally requested a presidential major disaster declaration this week for a windstorm late last year.
The windstorm impacted most of the state, toppling trees and powerlines, blocking roads and generally creating hazardous driving conditions. The winds lasted for hours, as winds from the upper atmosphere blasted the state, with some areas just beginning the early recovery process from devastating floods.
Some schools also lost their roof in the storm, five in all, Gianforte said in a press release. And in one of those schools, vermiculite asbestos was found.
In a press release from his office, Gianforte stated the ask from the federal government for windstorm damages is $6.5 million. Flooding in western Montana, which Gianforte also asked for a separate presidential disaster declaration on Jan. 9, totaled almost $10 million.
“The totality of impact from the most detrimental windstorm in 30 years is estimated to be $13.3 million,” Gianforte said in a press release. “Damages, response, and recovery efforts impacted 45 of 56 Montana Counties, five of seven Tribal Nations including one with significant water system damages, five school districts, and 19 of 25 Rural Electrical Cooperatives. Damage from the storm is spread across 80 percent of Montana.”
Gianforte went on to say the damage was “unparalleled for this time of year.”

A coalition of immigrant advocacy groups, as well as Democrats in Santa Fe, are calling on the Legislature to pass additional immigrant protection measures during the session beginning Jan. 20, 2026. (Patrick Lohmann/SourceNM)A group of eight New Mexico immigrant advocacy groups say they’ll push the Legislature to expand data privacy protections and increase funding for services during the session beginning Tuesday. 
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office has said the governor will include for consideration a proposal banning public entities from enabling immigrant detention during the 30-day session, which is otherwise focused primarily on passing the state budget. 
Groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and El Centro de Igualdad y Derechos said in a news release this week that they support the detention measure, known as the “Immigrant Safety Act.” 
“The Immigrant Safety Act is a critical step to protect New Mexican families by closing existing gaps in state law and prohibiting new detention contracts,” the groups said in a statement. 
But they are also calling on lawmakers to go farther to protect immigrants. They released a platform in English and Spanish calling on the Legislature to restrict the sharing of license plate data; make permanent the existing Office of New Americans; expand funds for immigrant legal services; and expand workforce development opportunities for immigrants. 
NM governor will include proposed ban on immigrant detention on legislative agenda

Groups comprising the “New Mexico Immigration Legislation Working Group” include Contigo Immigrant Justice, the Semilla Project, Semilla Action, CAFé Accion and the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, along with the ACLU and El Centro. 
“During these unprecedented times of uncertainty and growing challenges for immigrant communities, it is essential that we work together to promote safety, expand opportunity, and support our families across New Mexico,” the groups said in a statement. 
On Friday, the Democratic Party of Santa Fe endorsed a similar platform, including a “New Mexico Driver Safety and Privacy Act” that the party says would ensure people “residing in New Mexico and engaged in lawful and constitutionally protected activities would not have their private and confidential information shared with any agency seeking to detain or deport them.” 
Earlier this week, New Mexico Sen. Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) and Rep. Christine Chandler (D-Los Alamos) pre-filed legislation that sought to provide “limitations on the sharing of automated license plate reader information and requiring reporting,” according to the bill description. 
The bill text was not immediately available, House Democratic leaders said during a news conference Friday, but they said they are pushing for the legislation. 
By the #s: See where the New Mexico governor, Legislature disagree on $11B in budget priorities

The advocacy groups said the state currently has “no limits” on automatic license plate reader technology, which means outside organizations including the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency can access it. 
So they called on the Legislature to pass a bill that “would establish guardrails so surveillance data cannot be misused against immigrants, patients seeking medical care, or protesters,” the coalition said in a statement. “The Legislature must adopt these protections to safeguard privacy and prevent federal overreach.”
Regarding the immigrant detention legislation, Democrats in the majority have said they have reached a consensus on the bill and are hoping to pass the “Immigrant Safety Act” within the first two weeks of the session. 
But Republicans said Thursday they oppose the legislation that they said would undermine federal immigration law and also would devastate local economies. 
“The only outcome of ‘banning’ ICE Detention Facilities in New Mexico would be the destruction of New Mexico jobs and economic support for local communities,” Sen. Bill Sharer (R-Farmington) said in a statement. “Furthermore, by disrupting the enforcement of federal law with this virtue-signaling, Democrat lawmakers would enable violent criminals, who are in the United States illegally, the ability to continue terrorizing our neighborhoods.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9797-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-16 16:57:50.062523

It could come to an end under legislation filed in response to Hasbro’s plan to move out of the Ocean State. (Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles)As Pawtucket-based Hasbro Inc. makes its move to Boston later this year, one Rhode Island lawmaker thinks the state should stop issuing new license plates featuring one of the company’s most iconic toys.
Legislation introduced Wednesday by Rep. Brian Newberry, a North Smithfield Republican, would repeal the 2002 law that created the Mr. Potato Head plates to commemorate the toy’s 50th anniversary and raise money for the Rhode Island Community Food Bank.
Newberry told Rhode Island Current Friday that repealing future production of the plates is “a matter of self-respect” for the state. 
Hasbro to move to Boston Seaport by end of 2026

“Hasbro has abandoned Rhode Island and there’s no reason we should be advertising their products on our license plates,” Newberry said. “It’s as simple as that — to make a point.”
The toymaker announced last September that it would move to Boston’s Seaport by the end of 2026 to the dismay of state leaders who scrambled to put together a counteroffer to try to keep Hasbro and its 1,000-member workforce in the Ocean State. They tried to entice the company to buy a prime piece of undeveloped land in the I-195 Redevelopment District for $1.
The 765 drivers who still have the special plates affixed to their vehicles would be able to keep them, Newberry noted. But their plates would not be allowed to be transferred to other vehicles, according to the legislation.
Newberry’s bill was referred to the House Committee Special Legislation, which has not yet scheduled a hearing on the proposal. 
As of this year, the Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles issues 17 different charity license plate designs, ranging from shortfin mako sharks promoting the Atlantic Shark Institute to a Rose Island Lighthouse graphic featuring the Claiborne Pell Bridge — a design the Automobile License Plate Collectors Association named the world’s best last year.
State law authorizes the DMV to issue the charity plates after obtaining 600 pre-orders within five years of their creation by the state. 
“Some groups never reach the production minimum and their plate design option is pulled,” Paul Grimaldi, a spokesperson for the DMV said in an email.
But the only way to get an already-in production plate out of production is for the General Assembly to pull the plug— a power even the DMV hasn’t seen before.
“To the best of our knowledge this is the first time authorization for a plate that’s been issued would be repealed,” Grimaldi wrote.
Launched in 2002, the plates which say “Help End Hunger,” cost $43.50 to purchase. Half of the proceeds go to the DMV, while the rest go to the food bank.
Since its introduction over two decades ago, sales of the license plates have raised more than $60,000 for the Providence-based nonprofit — most of which came in the first few years of the plates’ existence, food bank spokesperson Kate MacDonald said.
“It was at a time when Mr. Potato Head was popping up everywhere!” she said in an email. “It hasn’t been as popular in the last few years.”
MacDonald declined to comment on Newberry’s legislation, but understands the negative feelings toward Hasbro after the company announced in September it would abandon its century-old Rhode Island roots after months of speculation about the company’s future in the Ocean State.
Should state leaders adopt Newberry’s repeal, MacDonald said the food bank is open to a new charity plate design. Newberry already had one in mind.
“Let’s come up with one with the Big Blue Bug,” he said, referring to Nibbles Woodaway, the giant termite mascot of Big Blue Bug Solutions on Interstate 95 in Providence.

Una victoria reciente puso fin a un despliegue de la Guardia Nacional en Los Ángeles.","This article is also available in English. Read it here.
A finales de diciembre, la situación cambió radicalmente en contra de la decisión de la administración Trump de desplegar la Guardia Nacional en tres estados, a pesar de las objeciones de sus gobernadores, incluido el de California.
 En primer lugar, el 23 de diciembre, la Corte Suprema de Estados Unidos falló a favor de Illinois en su intento de impedir que Trump enviara la Guardia Nacional a Chicago como parte de su ofensiva contra la inmigración. El tribunal rechazó el mismo razonamiento legal que Trump utilizó para federalizar y desplegar la Guardia Nacional en Los Ángeles el verano pasado cuando estallaron las protestas allí.
“El gobierno no ha cumplido con su carga de demostrar que (la ley) permite al Presidente federalizar la Guardia en el ejercicio de la autoridad inherente para proteger al personal y la propiedad federal en Illinois”, se lee en la orden de la Corte Suprema.
 Luego, la administración retiró discretamente su apelación contra la decisión de un tribunal federal que establecía que el presidente no podía mantener a las tropas de la Guardia Nacional de California bajo control federal a perpetuidad. Esta retirada representó una victoria para el fiscal general de California, Rob Bonta, quien había presentado un escrito amicus curiae en el caso de Illinois.
 “La ley se desarrolló de tal manera que evitará que lo ocurrido en los últimos seis meses se repita”, dijo Bonta. “Creo que esta puerta está cerrada para Trump”.
 CalMatters habló con Bonta esta semana sobre estos casos y su opinión sobre el enfoque actual de la administración Trump en Minneapolis . La entrevista ha sido ligeramente editada para mayor claridad.
CalMatters: En términos de lo que el estado de California hará a continuación sobre este tema, ¿hay algo que estén haciendo en preparación para tal vez que (las redadas de inmigración a gran escala) regresen, o tal vez una escalada en tácticas como las que estamos viendo en Minnesota?
 Bonta: Estamos preparados para cualquier cosa. Creo que cuando se ven incidentes como los de Minnesota, hay que asumir que podría ocurrir aquí en California.
Ya saben, la administración Trump no ha ocultado nada. Van tras los estados demócratas, y solo a por ellos. Y es político, es instrumentalización, es partidista. Intentan controlar a los liberales y a los demócratas. Esa es su razón de ser. Y, sobre todo, el estado más grande del país, que ha rechazado a Trump tres veces durante su campaña, le molesta, no le gusta.
 CalMatters: En Los Ángeles, no recuerdo que fueran puerta por puerta para intentar atrapar gente como vemos en Minnesota. ¿Es esto una escalada?
Bonta: Creo que están escalando. Minnesota muestra que parece haber una escalada. O sea, hubo algunos momentos similares, horribles, aterradores, traumatizantes e inapropiados, como quitar las placas de matrícula, usar camiones de mudanzas, llegar a un Home Depot y ver a la gente salir corriendo por la parte trasera, y toda la discriminación racial (racial profiling) que se estaba cometiendo.
 Creo que es una escalada, y están haciendo más. Están intentando atacar duramente a Minneapolis y Minnesota. Es el hogar del candidato a la vicepresidencia que compitió contra Trump, ¿verdad? Es el lugar donde su racismo se manifiesta plenamente con sus ataques a los somalíes. Es donde el YouTuber intentaba insinuar que había guarderías sin niños y que había algo inapropiado en lo que mostraba.
 Minnesota es un objetivo importante ahora mismo. California siempre lo ha sido, y creo que nos volverán a poner en la mira en algún momento, y estaremos preparados.

 CalMatters: ¿Qué pasó en la Corte Suprema?
 Bonta: La Corte Suprema intervino y básicamente dijo que la teoría sobre la que el presidente había estado operando todo este tiempo era completamente ilegal y sin fundamento, realmente una bofetada en la cara y una pérdida vergonzosa y devastadora para Trump, quien cree que siempre puede acudir a la Corte Suprema y obtener lo que quiere.
 Y cumplieron la ley, la ley que, según argumentamos, siempre se aplicó, y que no tenían autoridad para desplegar al ejército, que las “fuerzas regulares” incluían a las fuerzas militares. No se analizó su incapacidad para ejecutar la ley, y que ni siquiera tenían autoridad para ejecutar ninguna ley, dada la Ley Posse Comitatus (que impide al presidente utilizar al ejército como fuerza policial nacional). Así que fue una derrota devastadora e impactante para Trump.
 CalMatters: El Tribunal de Apelaciones del Noveno Circuito de EE. UU. autorizó al gobierno de Trump a desplegar la Guardia Nacional en Los Ángeles en junio, pero emitió un fallo diferente seis meses después. El razonamiento del juez de distrito fue que Trump no podía refederalizar las tropas indefinidamente.
 Pero ¿eso le indica que si las condiciones materiales en Los Ángeles cambiaran, como lo mencionó la administración Trump en junio cuando afirmó que los manifestantes estaban cometiendo actos violentos contra personal y propiedad federal, la administración Trump podría autorizar un nuevo despliegue? ¿Es así como lo entiende, o me equivoco?
Bonta: Creo que estás equivocado, pero no creo que sea algo descabellado decirlo. Déjame explicarte mi razonamiento.
En el caso de Los Ángeles, en junio, fue el primero en todo el país, y el ejercicio de la autoridad de la administración federal aquí, al desplegar las fuerzas armadas, implica una gran deferencia. Creo que se demostró esa deferencia. Fue el primer caso. Hubo protestas mayoritariamente pacíficas, pero también hubo violencia, como se acaba de mencionar.
 Era la primera vez que veían lo que la administración Trump estaba haciendo aquí.
Y luego lo volvieron a ver en Washington D. C. Luego lo volvieron a ver en Portland, y lo volvieron a ver en Illinois. Los jueces vieron lo que estaba sucediendo, lo que se decía y la justificación. Vieron cómo Trump dijo que Portland era una zona de guerra cuando era una ciudad pacífica. Vieron cómo Trump dice: ‘Voy a usar a los militares para hacer precisamente lo que prohíbe la Ley Posse Comitatus, para hacer cumplir la ley penal, porque estas ciudades demócratas no están tomando medidas enérgicas contra la delincuencia’. ¡Justamente lo que los militares no pueden hacer!
Y entonces vieron lo que estaba haciendo con los militares y creo que se hicieron una idea de hacia dónde se dirigía realmente esto y de lo que estaba sucediendo aquí. … Así que ahora que la Corte Suprema de los EE. UU. ha dicho que hay que asegurarse de que las ‘fuerzas regulares’ sean fuerzas militares, hay que demostrar que todas las fuerzas militares no pueden impedir que se lance el bloque de hormigón ni el cóctel molotov (nunca podrá demostrarlo), entonces se puede recurrir a la Guardia Nacional.
 CalMatters: Solo una acotación al respecto. Dadas las circunstancias actuales, si se repitiera lo ocurrido en junio, ¿sería diferente la conversación si las condiciones materiales sobre el terreno cambiaran en Los Ángeles?
 Bonta: Sí, totalmente diferente. Acudiríamos a los tribunales de inmediato, ganaríamos, obtendríamos una orden judicial y el Noveno Circuito la ratificaría. Porque no habría pruebas de que las fuerzas armadas, todas las fuerzas armadas —es decir, miles de militares, hay múltiples bases militares en California— no pudieran impedir que una sola persona lanzara concreto. Creo que nuestras fuerzas armadas son plenamente capaces de eso.
 Entonces, las mismas circunstancias exactas de junio ocurren hoy, el 9º Circuito lo confirma y no lo suspende.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/010625-Limon-Senate-Pro-Tem-MG-CM-18.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-16 16:57:50.062523
,DC,2026-01-16 21:05:20+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,The 5 biggest legal fights in the first year of Trump’s mass deportation push,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/5-biggest-legal-fights-first-year-trumps-mass-deportation-push,,"WASHINGTON — The first year of President Donald Trump’s return to the White House was defined by clashes with the judiciary branch, as the president and his administration pushed forward with an aggressive immigration agenda.In the past year, the Trump administration has aimed to drastically change immigration policy in the United States, including by stripping millions of immigrants of their legal status and attempting to redefine the constitutional right of birthright citizenship.  The moves have often run directly against the judiciary branch. Federal judges briefly stalled the Trump administration’s plans to deploy the National Guard in Portland, Oregon, for immigration enforcement. They also blocked the invocation of an archaic wartime law to expel immigrants from the country — a move that raised concerns, all the way up to the Supreme Court, about skirting the due process rights of immigrants.In response, the president for the last year frequently battled with federal judges, such as in June, when the Justice Department sued all judges in federal court in Maryland over a two-day pause in deportations to ensure due process rights for immigrants.Trump also fixated on certain judges that put his policies on hold, such as the District of Columbia’s Chief Judge James Emanuel Boasberg.Boasberg blocked the Trump administration from deporting certain immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and ordered the return of deportation flights that, despite his restraining order, still landed at a brutal prison in El Salvador. Trump’s singling out of Boasberg in late March, and calling for his impeachment, prompted a rare rebuke from conservative Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.But the Supreme Court has often handed wins to the Trump administration on numerous emergency appeals. The high court allowed for deportations of immigrants to countries they have no ties to, referred to as third-country removals, and allowed the use of race in immigration enforcement in Los Angeles. The president has found himself at odds with a range of groups in response to his harsh immigration policy.A group of Quakers sued the Department of Homeland Security after officials removed a so-called sensitive locations policy that limited immigration enforcement in places of worship. The Trump administration also faced backlash in its attempt to quickly deport Guatemalan children in the middle of the night, where a Trump nominated judge said the Department of Justice’s arguments for the move “crumbled like a house of cards.”Out of the dozens of lawsuits against the Trump administration, here are the five most significant court cases related to the president’s immigration policies:Alien Enemies ActLast March, two deportation planes carrying immigrants removed under an 18th-century wartime law were ordered to return to the U.S. by Boasberg, chief judge for the District Court for the District of Columbia. But the planes still landed in El Salvador, and 137 Venezuelan men were sent to a brutal prison known as CECOT after Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The wartime law would apply to any Venezuelan national 14 and older who was suspected of being a member of the Tren de Aragua gang. Boasberg then spent months probing whether Trump officials defied his order to turn the planes around. Last month, he concluded that the deportations were illegal and carried out in defiance of his order.The 137 Venezuelan men were eventually released from CECOT last summer through a prisoner exchange. Boasberg determined that even though the men are no longer imprisoned, they still need to be afforded their due process rights and he ordered the Trump administration to propose a way to afford those due process rights. In the latest major development, last month he directed the administration to create a plan on how to do that, such as providing some form of video interview before an immigration judge. The Trump administration has argued because of the U.S. military operations to extract Venezuela's president from the county, the situation is fluid, and they cannot provide a timeline for complying with Boasberg's order from last month. The Justice Department’s most recent filing, from Jan. 12, objects to the court's order to facilitate remote due process hearings, and “given the current political instability in Venezuela, there is a serious risk of intentional interference with remote proceedings.”Secretary of State Marco Rubio also submitted a Jan. 12 declaration to the court, saying that “introducing the matter of the disposition of the 137 class members into these discussions at this time would risk material damage to U.S. foreign policy interests in Venezuela.” He added that the U.S. does not know where the 137 Venezuelan men are. “Given the passage of time, the U.S. government does not know—nor does it have any way of knowing—the whereabouts of class members, including whether anyone has departed Venezuela or whether the regime subsequently took anyone back into custody,” Rubio said. Kilmar Abrego GarciaThe wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant and longtime Maryland man, cast a national spotlight on the president’s aggressive immigration crackdown. Abrego Garcia’s case has highlighted the Trump administration's appetite for mass deportations. The case started last March in the District Court of the District of Maryland, after Trump officials mistakenly removed Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, despite removal protections placed by an immigration judge in 2019 because it was likely Abrego Garcia would face violence if returned to his home country. But in March, Abrego Garcia was placed on a plane, along with Venezuelans removed under the Alien Enemies Act, to the brutal El Salvador mega-prison known as CECOT.Federal Judge Paula Xinis ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return, but the Trump administration took the issue all the way to the Supreme Court, arguing that it could not force another government to comply with the U.S.The Supreme Court sided with Abrego Garcia, but stopped short of ordering his return.   Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. several months later to face a criminal indictment in Tennessee over allegations of human smuggling. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges, and another federal judge has found cause that the Justice Department brought the indictment in a vindictive move against Abrego Garcia.Since his return, Abrego Garcia has detailed psychological and physical torture he experienced at CECOT. The Trump administration has also tried to remove him to a country to which he has no ties because of the 2019 removal protections.Trump officials re-detained Abrego Garcia and have tried to remove him to the African nations of Eswatini, Ghana, Uganda and Liberia, despite Costa Rica’s willingness to accept Abrego Garcia as a refugee and his willingness to go. For that reason, Xinis ordered Abrego Garcia’s release from an ICE facility in Pennsylvania and barred the Trump administration from re-detaining him. She is currently overseeing Abrego Garcia’s challenge to his detention on the grounds that the Trump administration is using his imprisonment as punishment rather than for the purpose of removal. A Jan. 14 hearing was the most recent development in Abrego Garcia’s case. There, Xinis briefly conferred with his lawyers and Department of Justice attorneys regarding the timing of a final order of removal for Abrego Garcia was issued — the question was whether it was in 2019 or January 2025. The timing of the order of removal could determine whether the Trump administration can re-detain Abrego Garcia for removal. Xinis in December ordered Abrego Garcia’s release, because she determined the Trump administration was unlawfully detaining him and said ICE failed repeatedly to show a final order of removal existed.Xinis said she plans to make a final decision in Abrego Garcia’s case by Feb. 12.Birthright CitizenshipOne of Trump’s first executive orders he signed on Inauguration Day was ending the constitutional right to birthright citizenship. Under birthright citizenship, all children born in the United States are considered citizens, regardless of their parents’ legal status. There is a small carve-out for the children born of diplomats. If birthright citizenship were to be eliminated, more than 250,000 children born each year would not be granted U.S. citizenship and it would effectively create a class of 2.7 million stateless people by 2045, according to a recent study by the think tank the Migration Policy Institute.In response to Trump’s executive order, multiple lawsuits were filed and lower courts across the country have granted preliminary injunctions against the order. One of the challenges to birthright citizenship, brought by Democratic attorneys general, made its way to the Supreme Court, but the Trump administration asked the justices to weigh in on the issue of nationwide injunctions issued by lower courts, rather than the merits of birthright citizenship. The justices decided on an order that limited nationwide injunctions, such as class action suits. The merits of birthright citizenship are now before the Supreme Court, which is expected to hear oral arguments in February. That birthright citizenship case is Barbara v. Trump, which stems from a case in New Hampshire. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction to bar the executive order from taking effect against a class of babies born on or after Feb. 20, 2025. Those children would have been denied citizenship under the president's executive order.  Lawmakers’ Access to ICE Facilities As the Trump administration continues with aggressive immigration enforcement and detention, one of the few tools Democrats have, as the minority party, is oversight of Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. More than 60,000 immigrants are detained across various ICE facilities in the country, and Democrats argue they need access to conduct oversight at the facilities. Under a 2019 appropriations law, any lawmaker can carry out an unannounced visit at a federal facility that holds immigrants. But after several Democrats were denied access to ICE facilities in July, due to a policy instituted by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that required seven days notice, a dozen House Democrats sued. Last month, a federal judge granted the lawmakers' request to stay the new policy by Noem. But after Minnesota lawmakers said they were denied an oversight visit to an ICE facility following a deadly shooting by an immigration officer in Minneapolis, Democrats were back in court Jan. 14.Noem required a seven-day notice, nearly identical to the policy that initially prompted the suit from Democrats last year. The federal judge handling the case, Jia Cobb, is probing whether the Trump administration has violated her court order.Democrats who sued include: Joe Neguse of Colorado, Adriano Espaillat of New York, Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Robert Garcia of California, J. Luis Correa of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Veronica Escobar of Texas, Dan Goldman of New York, Jimmy Gomez of California, Raul Ruiz of California, Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and Norma Torres of California.Expanded Use of Expedited Removal A pillar of the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign is the expanded use of expedited removal. The Trump policy allows the removal of immigrants through the interior of the country without an appearance before an immigration judge.In March, immigration advocacy groups sued the Trump administration over the policy, arguing it stripped due process rights of immigrants. In August, the District Court for the District of Columbia issued a stay in the policy, temporarily blocking the Trump administration from using it. The Department of Justice appealed, and in September a panel of appellate judges denied the Trump administration’s request to lift the lower courts’ stay. Most recently, in December, the Trump administration defended the merits of its fast-track deportation policy before a panel of judges in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.

(Photo by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)The First District Court of Appeal is looking to fill a seat — the one vacated by Adam Tanenbaum, who was elevated this week to the Florida Supreme Court by Gov. Ron DeSantis.
The First District, located in Tallahassee, is the most important state court aside from the Supreme Court itself, as it adjudicates cases arising from state law and policy, such as the high-profile redistricting case Byrd v. Black Voters Matter.
Applicants must live within the jurisdiction of the court and have been a member of the Florida Bar for the preceding 10 years.
The Judicial Nominating Commission is accepting applications until Feb. 9. The commission will meet next month to review applications and schedule interviews. The group then meets and vets candidates to create a group of candidates to advance to the governor. The governor then gets to appoint a candidate to fill the vacancy.
There are 13 seats on the court.
The court now consists of Chief Judge Timothy Osterhaus and judges Joseph Lewis Jr., L. Clayton Roberts, Lori S. Rowe, Stephanie W. Ray, Ross L. Bilbrey, Susan L. Kelsey, Thomas D. Winokur, Kemmerly Thomas, Rachel E. Nordby, Robert E. Long Jr., and Raymond F. Treadwell.

Andrea Hunley, the Indiana Senate’s second-ranking Democrat, isn’t seeking reelection this year amid speculation that she’ll be a 2027 candidate for Indianapolis mayor.
Hunley announced Friday she would give up her Senate seat, becoming the fourth state senator to say this will be their final legislative session.
At least six Indiana House members also won’t be seeking new terms, with the latest decision coming from Republican Rep. Brad Barrett of Richmond, who is chair of the House Public Health Committee.
Hunley is the Senate’s assistant minority leader after winning election in 2022 from a heavily Democratic district covering much of central Marion County.
Hunley, a former teacher and school principal, said she would complete her Senate term that runs until November. Hunley did not address talk of a mayoral campaign although her statement said she “continues to discern how she will be called to serve next.”
“While my role may change, my commitment to this work will not, “ she said in the statement. “Our city needs bold leadership to be a world class destination for people to work, play, study, and stay. I am not going anywhere.”
Although Democratic Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett hasn’t said whether he’ll seek a fourth term in the 2027 election, former City-County Council President Vop Osili announced this week he was running for mayor.
Other incumbent decisions
Barrett, meanwhile, recently released a statement saying he would not seek reelection and leave the House after eight years representing Wayne County and part of Henry County.

Barrett, a retired general surgeon, has led the House Public Health Committee since the 2021 session.
Candidates have until Feb. 6 to file for the 25 Indiana Senate and 100 Indiana House seats up for election this year.
Besides Hunley, Republican Sens. Eric Bassler of Washington and Kyle Walker of Indianapolis are not seeking reelection. Democratic Sen. J.D. Ford of Indianapolis is running for a congressional seat.
Other House members not seeking new terms are Republicans Mike Karickhoff of Kokomo and Shane Lindauer of Jasper and Democrat Sue Errington of Muncie.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  BlueCross BlueShield’s new CEO takes over as insurer faces federal and statewide challenges.","On Saturday, Beth Roberts officially took the helm as the new president and CEO of BlueCross BlueShield of Vermont.
Less than a week later, the window closed on open enrollment for Affordable Care Act marketplace plans, without any extension of the federal tax credits that made those plans affordable for thousands of Vermonters.
It’s no secret that Roberts assumes the role as the health care industry — and her new employer, specifically — faces dire straits.

BlueCross BlueShield of Vermont has faced serious risks to its solvency and intensely butted heads with Vermont’s main hospital system. All the while, Vermonters face some of the highest health care costs in the country. 
In an interview with VTDigger, Roberts said she was optimistic she will turn a new page on affordability in the state. 
“My career has been built on running towards the fire,” she said. “Even though it’s in a very complicated state right here, and health care is in a complicated way right now, I think there’s a lot of great work that can be done.” 
Prior to joining BlueCross BlueShield, Roberts worked as president of the Beth Israel Lahey Health Performance Network, a Boston-area health care provider. Prior to that, she built her career in health insurance groups across New England, including 20 years working at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. 
During her time at Beth Israel Lahey, she worked on negotiating contracts between the hospitals and health insurers — something that’s primed her, she said, for a healthier collaboration with the University of Vermont Health network. In negotiating past contracts and rates, the insurer and hospital network have had an “ongoing adversarial relationship,” as a state-appointed liaison described it, in part over the costs of care for patients covered by BlueCross BlueShield.
In October, the health network gained new leadership under Steve Leffler, who was officially named CEO in January after serving as interim following former CEO Sunny Eappen’s decision to step down in the fall.
Roberts joined BlueCross BlueShield on Nov. 10, and worked with outgoing president and CEO Don George to transfer responsibilities during the two months they overlapped.
Both of the new leaders at UVM and BlueCross negotiated the new contract for 2026. The outcome was “a better deal than what was expected,” Roberts said, though she did not elaborate further. That work has been a primary piece of Roberts’ first few months in the role.
“I think there was a strong desire by both BlueCross BlueShield of Vermont and UVM Health network to do something different,” she said. 
She sees more room for cooperation with the state’s hospitals, beyond UVM, like trying to “cut down the noise” and streamline policies across providers and insurers, so that there is less time spent tailoring rates for specific plans and providers. She also noted that the hospitals and insurers can share resources better — things like care managers and quality experts that each entity has. 
Both the hospital and the insurer are facing the loss of federal enhanced premium tax credits, the subsidies that made plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplace actually affordable for thousands of Vermonters. 
Early data from the Department of Vermont Health Access shows that more than 2,000 people across the state unenrolled from those marketplace plans (including BlueCross BlueShield and MVP Health Care). 
Roberts said she is working on finding affordable pathways for those who have lost these subsidies. 
She said the insurer is working with Vermont legislators and the regulator to find “wiggle room” in what the plans cover, to make them less expensive. 
She is also exploring whether there is appetite for less expensive plans that cover preventative, wellness care and catastrophic care, without as much coverage for some standard care types that fall in the middle of that range of coverage.
“Affordable” has become something of a buzzword in the Vermont health care space — and Roberts is no exception to that. But she said she’s also added a new adjective to the mix: sustainable. 
She knows that bringing down premium costs in Vermont and making care affordable again is going to take a long, sustained effort. 
“We are so far off the mark on affordability in Vermont, with (spending on healthcare) being 19.6% of household income,” she said. “It is going to take a lot of years to get from the 19.6% to a more reasonable level, so we have to keep our eye on that frame for a duration of time before we can shift down.”

(Photo: Christine Zhu/NC Newsline)Retaliatory tariffs could have harsh economic consequences for North Carolina’s agricultural sector, according to a new report from the John Locke Foundation.
Over the past year, President Donald Trump has raised tariffs on foreign imports to the U.S. Major trade partners like the European Union, China and Canada imposed retaliatory tariffs in response, leading to trade wars and increased prices across the board.
“How Tariffs Threaten North Carolina Agriculture: NC Farmers at Risk,” authored by Jeffrey Dorfman at North Carolina State University, estimates the tariffs could cost the state’s farmers about $695 million.
This figure represents roughly a third of average net farm income in North Carolina.
“Such a contraction would lead to a total of roughly 8,000 lost jobs, both directly in the agriculture industry along with the ripple effects from that lost revenue,” Dorfman wrote. “The job losses would be concentrated in North Carolina’s rural communities.”
Other indirect effects on the state’s rural economy would result in an additional $1.2 billion in estimated revenue losses, Dorfman wrote. This brings the potential total economic losses as a result of trade policy retaliation to $1.9 billion, which is more than 2% of North Carolina’s gross state product.
Donald Bryson, CEO of the Locke Foundation, a free-market think tank, said the organization commissioned the study because it has become increasingly concerned about the effect of recent agricultural policies on the state’s food supply chain.
“We are an export-dependent state,” he said. “Agriculture is the largest sector of North Carolina’s economy, and we wanted to know how this is going to be affected by the tariff regime.”
North Carolina Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler said tariffs are often difficult to quantify because a lot depends on short-term versus long-term impacts.
Troxler said they’re usually used as bargaining tools.
“If tariffs result in a more open market, that can be beneficial in the long term, but when it gets into a trade war, it does do harm in the short term,” Troxler said in a statement to NC Newsline. “It’s hard to paint tariffs with just one paintbrush.”
North Carolina ranks 15th in the country for exports and 13th for imports by dollar value. It’s also eighth for total gross farm sales of crops and livestock — especially poultry and hogs.
Farmers in the state have a limited set of options for minimizing damage from agricultural exports, Dorfman wrote. These include looking for new markets and focusing on domestic trade.
“Still, while all these are worth pursuing, they are not likely to be sufficient — especially in the short run — to mitigate the risks North Carolina farmers currently face from a potentially damaging tariff regime,” the report read.
The U.S. exported $24.5 billion worth of soybeans in 2024, with China, Mexico, and the EU as the top markets. North Carolina contributes heavily to soybean production.
Soybeans are the U.S.’s top agricultural export, but North Carolina soybeans are rarely exported; instead, they are used domestically to feed local pigs, chickens and turkeys.
Although the state’s soybeans go almost exclusively to animal feed, they are not protected from the risks of trade policy retaliation, Dorfman wrote. China chose not to buy American soybeans for much of 2025, causing the domestic supply of soybeans to soar and lowering their price in U.S. markets.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0628-scaled-e1768596460674-1024x758.jpg,,,2026-01-16 15:57:28.450343

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)DETROIT – U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens said Friday that the federal government’s most controversial Immigration and Customs Enforcement deployments have happened in cities without input from local officials who don’t want or need their assistance with law enforcement activities.
Stevens, who was in Detroit on Friday to detail a new minority-focused policy initiative in her campaign for the U.S. Senate, spoke to Michigan Advance following the event to talk about her campaign and other pressing topics in national and state politics.
On ICE and its recent flurry of activity in Minneapolis, which led to the shooting death of an American citizen, Stevens said President Donald Trump’s iteration of the agency has by and large circumvented state and local law enforcement, in effect escalating tensions that already existed between activists and ICE as it slides into alarmingly authoritarian behavior.
She said time and again, local officials have pleaded with the administration not to take these actions, as it “will only escalate tension and make things worse.”
Stevens said with Trump now toying with invoking the Insurrection Act to prevent activists from tracking ICE activities and to end the resistance brewing against the agency, she has introduced legislation to close loopholes that allows him to do so.
“Trump has deployed a mismanaged federal agency into a city, in a neighborhood,” Stevens said, adding that whether it’s in Minnesota or here in Michigan, local officials need to be heard.
“I know how deeply important that is,” Stevens said.

Trump has in the last week threatened to cut funding to any state with openly defiant sanctuary city policies, and the impact in Michigan remains unknown. The U.S. Department of Justice has only identified one city in Michigan — East Lansing — as being designated as a sanctuary city for immigrants seeking refuge from federal enforcement.
That list is longer, however, according to the Center for Immigration Studies, an anti-immigration think tank. The group lists six Michigan counties — Kalamazoo, Leelanau, Muskegon, Oakland, Washtenaw and Wayne counties —as having some level of sanctuary policies.
The president has also made references to sending ICE or other federalized National Guard troops to Detroit, but officials have rebuffed that notion, noting that Detroit was not a sanctuary city. Still, that hasn’t stopped Republicans in the state and on the national stage from setting their sights on Detroit as another test for Trump’s incursions into states with federal forces.
In the case of Minnesota, some have called on Gov. Tim Walz to deploy the state’s National Guard troops as a hedge between federal ICE and Border Patrol agents and citizens, both to cool down tensions but to also prevent ICE from abusing its authority by targeting U.S. citizens with violence or unlawful arrests.
The Advance asked Stevens if she would support Gov. Gretchen Whitmer potentially doing the same if Trump decided to unleash ICE in Detroit or elsewhere in the state, and especially if ICE activity rises to the level of chaos in Michigan as it has in Minnesota.
“I think Gov. Whitmer has a tremendous track record of safety and security,” Stevens said. “We saw her leadership through the COVID-19 pandemic, and I have full faith and trust in her ability to keep Michiganders safe.”
On congressional softness against Trump, Stevens said she’s fighting back
One key source of frustration for Democrats and those who oppose Trump’s most hardline policies is that members of Congress in both chambers have done little to push back against the administrations and its worst abuses of power.
Stevens said she was not part of that camp.
“I’m very eager to call out the abuses of power we’re seeing in communities, particularly the mismanaged ICE that has brought a lot of chaos and concern,” Stevens said. “I’m hearing directly from Michiganders and, frankly, I am so frustrated and upset about what’s happening before our eyes.”
Despite accepting corporate PAC money, Stevens insists she can’t be bought
As Stevens continues her campaign for the U.S. Senate as the race’s frontrunner, up against state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) and former health official Abdul El-Sayed, of Detroit, she faces continued criticisms from being the only Democrat in the race to have not sworn off corporate donations.
Progressives looking for a candidate to support may very well skip on Stevens due to her acceptance of corporate dollars and also her stance on the war in Gaza and ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people — Stevens is a staunch supporter of Israel but has called for a meaningful ceasefire and an end to the war.
The Advance asked Stevens if she is worried that those corporate dollars will be an anchor to her campaign as activists and her opponents continue to note those dollars in her coffers.
Stevens turned her attention not to her opponents, but rather the leading Republican in the race, former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers of White Lake.
“Mike Rogers says that he wants to rubber stamp Donald Trump. That’s going to be the agenda that is going to continue to increase costs and wreak havoc on our economy, like we’ve seen playing out,” Stevens said. “I can’t be bought. I’m the only person in this race who is not a millionaire. My record speaks for itself, and that’s a record of voting for comprehensive campaign finance reform as a House member and seeing it blocked by the Senate. And that is one of the reasons why I’m running for the United States Senate, to see us actually get comprehensive campaign finance reform done.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7010-scaled-1-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-16 15:57:28.450343

(CRMC File No. 2025-06-048)A Jamestown oyster farm is poised for expansion, after receiving unanimous approval from the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council on Tuesday.
The council’s swift stamp of approval lets Rocky Rhode Oyster Co. owner Brad Boehringer add 3.5 acres to his existing, 7.8-acre oyster farm in Jamestown’s Dutch Island Harbor.
The uncontested review was an anomaly in the increasingly contentious debate between oyster farmers, fishermen and coastal residents warring over use and views of state coastal waterways. Rhode Island’s aquaculture boom has spawned public protests, late-night hearings and lawsuits, with protracted regulatory reviews that, in some cases, span years. 
It helped that Boehringer’s existing expanse of oyster cases, 900 feet off the western shore off Dutch Island Harbor, falls within an area already designated by town and state officials for aquaculture use. 
Rocky Rhode is one of six aquaculture farms covering a combined 35 acres within a 90-acre area in Dutch Island Harbor designated for aquaculture use, according to a 2024 report. The report helped inform a working group of town officials and state environmental administrators in developing rules and regulations for future aquaculture development in the area. 
Boehringer’s southwest expansion aims to meet increasing commercial demand, enabling Boehringer to keep his eight seasonal residents employed year-round and boost production to reach 1 million oysters and 100,000 scallops a year, according to his June 2025 application. He already produces and harvests enough shellfish to service 45 area restaurants and five regional wholesales.
The 3.5-acre addition, a mix of bottom cages and floating baskets, received positive recommendations from the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, the Rhode Island Marine Fisheries Council, the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, according to the CRMC staff report. 
A preliminary application reviewed by the Jamestown Harbor Commission in December 2024 also revealed “very few issues,” Benjamin Goetsch, CRMC aquaculture coordinator, wrote in the Dec. 15 report. In fact, the expansion could have been approved by staff, without a public hearing or review by the politically appointed council, if it weren’t for two written letters of objection.
The letters, both from seasonal Jamestown residents, laid out concerns with debris and sand filling from the expanded aquaculture activity, and potential conflicts with area sailing activity. The objectors did not attend the hearing on Tuesday.
Goetsch’s report refuted each of these claims, noting that all human activity on or near the water could create debris, and that the Coast Guard had already indicated no navigational interference.
Boehringer told the council Tuesday that he had a “very good working relationship” with the Conanicut Island Sailing Foundation, which is the primary group of sailors in the area. 
New non-rusting oyster cages avoid the risk that pieces chip off and collect in the water – a problem of older versions of the equipment no longer in use, Boehringer said.
The CRMC’s approval requires any lost gear or equipment be retrieved within 30 days. Boehringer will also have to put up a $40,000 performance bond to cover potential costs associated with gear removal or abandonment.
Boehringer declined to comment on the council’s decision when reached by email on Wednesday.

Other Democrats have called for investigations, and reforms, cutting funding for immigration enforcement, or abolishing ICE altogether. 
But so far, only two Pennsylvania Democrats have signed on to an effort to remove Noem from office. Rep. Summer Lee, was among the first co-sponsors on the impeachment articles, while Chris Deluzio, who represents the broader Pittsburgh area, committed to adding his name to the co-sponsors, according to a spokesperson.
More than a week ago, an ICE agent in Minneapolis shot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen, as she tried to drive away from agents.

Footage of the shooting and the moments proceeding it went viral, stoking outrage and focusing the nation’s attention on the Trump administration’s militarized deportation campaign. But views among lawmakers split largely along partisan lines over whether the agent, who walked around the car to position himself in front of it when he fired the first shot, was acting in self-defense or using force unjustifiably. The second and third shots were fired from the side of the vehicle. 
The Capital-Star asked all eight Democrats in Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation how the House and Senate should respond to the shooting and the resulting unrest. Initial emails were sent before articles of impeachment were introduced this past Wednesday, and follow-ups were sent afterward.
While the Capital-Star’s questions included whether they supported impeachment, only Deluzio and Lee responded to the question directly.
“DHS agencies have demonstrated a pattern of violence against people with little to no accountability, emboldened by an administration that acts without impunity and adds fuel to the fire,” Lee said in a statement before articles of impeachment were introduced. “I would support articles of impeachment against this lawless administration.”
“It’s past time to abolish ICE once and for all,” Lee added.

“Renee Good’s killing in Minneapolis is a tragedy, and my heart goes out to her grieving family and community,” Deluzio said in a statement.” From what I’ve seen so far, it is outrageous and disturbing that the Trump Administration immediately called this a ‘domestic terrorism’ incident. We need an independent investigation—and for the Congress to bring real oversight and accountability to ICE and Secretary Noem’s failed leadership.”
Congressional Republicans have largely rallied around the federal officers and DHS’ defense of the shooting. 
The Capital-Star also reached out to the nine Republican members, but only one, Rep. Dan Meuser from Luzerne County, responded. A spokesperson sent the Capital-Star a Fox News interview from shortly after the killing of Good.
“I mean, law enforcement says, ‘Hey, stop, open up your door, let me see your ID,’ and then not only do you take off, but you go right at somebody as they jump out of the way of the car, basically you’re trying to run them over,” Meuser said. “That’s not what a normal person does to anyone, let alone law enforcement.”
President Donald Trump and the Department of Homeland Security have claimed that Good was trying to hit the officer with her vehicle, and he was acting in self defense. The administration has also called Good’s a “domestic terrorist.” Immediately following the shooting, Noem said that Good, “weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.” 
But Open Source Intelligence analysts at the New York Times, Bellingcat and the Washington Post all concluded that Good appeared to be driving away from the officer when he fired at her.
In the days following the shooting, protests against ICE erupted around the country, including in Pennsylvania. DHS ordered additional federal  agents to Minneapolis, where daily life has been disrupted for residents, schools and businesses. 
Where Pennsylvania’s other Democratic reps stand
Many of Deluzio and Lee’s Pennsylvania Democratic colleagues have stopped short of further action beyond calls for investigations and increased oversight. But, none ruled out support for impeachment.
U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio (D-17th District)
Successfully removing Noem from office is unlikely. Impeachment would require a majority vote in the House, which Democrats don’t hold by a 218-213 margin. A two-thirds vote in the Senate to convict, which would require significant support from the Republican majority. 
Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-05), who has a background in immigration advocacy, agreed to an interview with the Capital-Star. She was unequivocal in her condemnation of the shooting of Good, and ICE’s use of force across the country under the Trump administration.
“The whole enforcement push with armed and masked agents in American cities has been dangerous from the start,” Scanlon said. “There have been multiple incidents where these ICE and Customs and Border Patrol agents have pulled their guns on people on American streets. There seem to be some serious questions about training, about the conditions in which they should be engaging with people, and huge questions about who it is they’re pursuing.”
Asked what she would support to rein in the agency, including impeachment, Scanlon said that effective measures would require a “Democratic majority.”
“I think we’re constantly struggling with the gap between what we should be doing and what we can be doing in the minority,” Scanlon said. The reality is Congress can’t act without a majority, and right now Congressional Republicans are too afraid of Donald Trump to do what the country needs.”
She called for investigations into the shooting and how ICE is spending its money.
Scanlon, Lee and Deluzio were also among the six of Pennsylvania’s seven Democratic representatives in the House who signed onto a letter to Noem calling for DHS “to take immediate steps to preserve evidence, bring in unbiased investigative partners like the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, and ensure the officers involved comply fully with investigators.”

The letter also included specific questions for DHS, including what kind of training the officers involved in Good’s shooting received and what steps the agency is taking to prevent recurring violence against civilians.
Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-02) was the lone Pennsylvania Democrat who did not sign the petition. He did, however, call for Noem’s resignation in a post on the social media platform X.
A spokesperson for Boyle did not respond to multiple questions from the Capital-Star about what steps the congressman would support to provide a check on immigration enforcement, including impeachment, but referred to a social media post he made.
“Kristi Noem is lying,” Boyle said. “We all saw the video. She must resign. And this heinous killing must be criminally investigated to the full extent of the law.”
A spokesperson for Rep. Dwight Evans (D-03) referred the Capital-Star to a social media post.
“I condemn this brutal murder in Minneapolis by ICE  agents,” Evans wrote. “There should be bipartisan outrage about this tragedy. The Republican majorities in Congress need to join with Democrats to demand reform and accountability. This violence cannot and should not be normalized.”
Democratic Reps. Madeleine Dean (D-04) and Chrissy Houlahan (D-06) did not respond to questions from the Capital-Star, but both called for investigations on social media. Houlahan also called for the firing of any official who lied about the circumstances of the shooting.
Pennsylvania Democratic U.S. Sen. John Fetterman did not respond to the Capital-Star, but called the incident a tragedy in statements to the press last week.

Patrick Morrisey told the public Wednesday night during his State of the State address that he wanted a 10% personal income tax cut, saying it should be a priority to put more money back into people’s pockets.
The next morning, his finance staff presented a budget to Senators seeking a 5% cut, and the budget was calculated with a 5% tax cut included. 
The same reduced request went before members of the House Finance Committee on Friday, prompting Del. John Williams, D-Monongalia, to ask, “What was the thought process in going with 10% on Wednesday night, and then coming back here 12 hours later and saying 5%?
In response, Department of Revenue Deputy Secretary Mike Muchow said the governor “wants at least 5% and would like to get 10%, but he wants to involve the Legislature to make sure that everybody is comfortable with getting to 10%.”
Williams wasn’t sold on the explanation.
Del. John Williams, D-Monongalia
“I feel as if that was said the night before, with 10% because there were cameras in the room, and everyone was talking about it,” he said after the meeting. “All of a sudden that changes.  I felt as if it was a disingenuous representation. It was like a bad dating profile.”
The state’s tax-cut trigger formula, passed by lawmakers in 2023, didn’t trigger a tax cut this year because West Virginia didn’t meet the revenue goal in this past fiscal year. 
Morrisey’s tax cut isn’t a done deal for lawmakers, who this week began vetting the governor’s proposed budget. A 5% tax cut would cost about $125 million; a 10% would equal around $250 million.
The governor and his budget office say the state can afford the tax cut, pointing to strong rainy day funds and general revenue numbers as a reason lawmakers can pass a tax cut. Changes to the Public Employees Insurance Agency plan have saved money, and finding “inefficiencies” in agencies’ spending helped too, they said.

Del. Michael Hite, R-Berkeley, said, “the math doesn’t make sense.”
“What happened between last year and this year that we have overcome a $400 million structural deficit in the out years, and we can afford a 10% personal income tax cut?” Hite asked.
A six-year plan, used as a budget forecasting tool put together by the Morrisey administration, projects a $204 million gap in fiscal 2028. Additionally, State Budget Director Mike McKown told lawmakers that looming federal cuts under President Donald Trump threaten the state’s budget health.
“You’re kidding ourselves if we think that we can make up for federal loss. Federal funds dwarf the general revenue funds,” McKown said.
There’s also budget pressures — the largest one being increasing the cost of the Hope Scholarship, the state’s education voucher program. The voucher will be available to all students for the first time next school year for an estimated price of $230 million — an increase of about $127 million in the coming fiscal year.
“The big one is fully funding the Hope Scholarship,” Revenue Secretary Eric Nelson told lawmakers.
Morrisey’s request for a pay raise for all state employees would cost around $78.4 million, and an increase for the employers of the PEIA is estimated to cost $35.1 million.
Williams said the projected budget gap in coming years along with decreased federal dollars coming into West Virginia are factors to consider as lawmakers weigh Morrisey’s tax cut proposal.
Morrisey’s budget request included a $13 million increase from last year to cover administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program after the Trump administration shifted more costs for the food aid program onto the state.
“Right now, to say a 5% cut, maybe a 10% cut, I don’t see how that’s fiscally responsible,” Williams said.
McKown told lawmakers that 2026 revenue collections are $128 million above estimate.
“We anticipate to end the year with a healthy surplus,” he said.
Nelson told lawmakers, “We all should be extremely proud of where we are right now.”
State agencies were asked to cut 2% this year, and Nelson told lawmakers that strategic cuts were estimated to save the state $120 million. 
Kelly Allen, executive director at the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, said in a statement that the budget presented by prioritized deeper tax cuts and paying for the Hope Scholarship, which opens up to all students next school year for an estimated price of $230 million. 
“He said himself these budget priorities will create hard decisions for many years to come, while his administration’s six year plan shows growing deficits in upcoming years that will strain our ability to invest in PEIA, health care, infrastructure and other needs,” Allen said.
West Virginia’s constitution requires that lawmakers pass a balanced budget.

(iStock / Getty Images Plus)COLUMBIA — More than 550 people have been sickened with measles in three Upstate counties, the state health department said Friday.
The number of cases exploded in the beginning of the new year, with 148 reported in the past week. Since Jan. 7, the case count has more than doubled, according to the health department.
South Carolina has among the largest outbreaks in the nation, second only to Texas, which reported more than 800 cases in 2025.
Eight people have been hospitalized for complications of measles, state epidemiologist Linda Bell told reporters. The state health department does not track cases after they are reported, so she did not give any more information about how they are doing or what type of care they received.
Travel and gatherings over the holiday season are the likely culprits for the spike in cases, she said.
When schools let out for winter break, health department officials struggled to track down unvaccinated students to let them know they’d been exposed to the virus. They continued going out and seeing family, often without knowing they were infected, increasing the disease’s spread, Bell said.

More than 180 students at 10 schools were in quarantine as of Friday, according to the Department of Public Health. For the first time since the outbreak began in October, that includes schools outside of Spartanburg County, the epicenter of the outbreak.
At Crestview Elementary School in Greenville County, 22 students are in quarantine. And Starr Elementary School in rural Anderson County reported a measles case this week, causing 10 students to quarantine.
Vaccination is the only sure way to prevent cases from continuing to spread, Bell said.
Most people receive two doses of the vaccine, which also covers mumps and rubella, during childhood. Anyone who is unvaccinated but wants protection from measles can get the shots at a doctor’s office or health clinic.
At least 87% of those diagnosed with measles during the outbreak are unvaccinated, according to the health department. The agency has not been able to determine a vaccination status for another 56.
“This is a disappointment, to see these now hundreds of cases that a majority of them could have been prevented, and we have an opportunity to prevent further cases if people can adopt available tools and help us stop this outbreak sooner rather than later,” Bell told reporters this week.
Measles can cause dangerous complications, especially for children, who make up the majority of those sickened during the outbreak. Symptoms typically start with a fever, followed by a rash that often begins on the face before spreading to the rest of the body. In severe cases, measles can cause pneumonia or brain swelling, which can sometimes be fatal.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/measles-vaccine-1024x719.jpg,,,2026-01-16 15:57:28.450343

(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A push in the Kansas Legislature for greater transparency in the way Kansas Supreme Court Justices are selected furthers a revolt against the current merit-based system.
An attorney and Republican legislator teamed up to introduce Senate Bill 299, which would force the Kansas Supreme Court Nominating Commission to make public most of its records, including information on candidates for the commission.
Current Supreme Court rules dictate that all nominating commission records be confidential, but the commission has discretion to release judicial applicants’ names, employment history, educational background and home cities. A nine-member nominating commission selects three candidates based on merit, and the governor appoints a justice from the list of three.
Joshua Ney, an attorney who sits on the 2nd Judicial District’s nominating commission, was the lone proponent who testified Thursday to the Senate Federal and State Affairs Committee.
To him, the Supreme Court nominating commission “sure looks like a smoke-filled room.”
The commission is still subject to public meeting laws and has historically released information on its three selected candidates upon sending them to the governor. The commission’s interviews with hopefuls are also open to the public before members select their three nominees. But Ney took issue with the commission refusing to release the names and information of candidates for commission seats, including the chairman.
Ney said he helped brainstorm the bill, which Republican committee chair Sen. Mike Thompson of Shawnee introduced last April on Ney’s behalf.
“I don’t see a reason for secrecy in nominating commission proceedings,” Ney said. “I don’t see a parallel in any other public office where you can’t get the name of who else has filed for the office you’re considering filing — or someone else is considering filing for — ʼtil afterwards.”
Ney filed last spring to be considered for a vacancy on the nominating commission, he said in written testimony. He and his former law firm partner, Ryan Kriegshauser, who was recently appointed to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Kansas, repeatedly pressed appellate court clerk Doug Shima for explanations as to why candidate records were exempt from disclosure, according to emails from March included in Ney’s testimony. Shima repeatedly cited Supreme Court rules and existing law, stating he, as secretary of the commission for the past decade, does not release candidates’ names until the nomination process is closed.
The nominating commission consists of one attorney and one non-attorney from each of Kansas’ four Congressional districts, and one attorney chair. The chairman and two members from the 4th Congressional District were appointed last year, and the terms of two members representing the 1st Congressional District will expire in 2026. Lawyers are appointed to the commission by their peers, and the governor appoints non-lawyer members.
No one publicly opposed the bill.
If the House and Senate both pass the bill, and the governor signs it into law, it would go into effect July 1, around one month before voters are scheduled to weigh in on a proposed constitutional amendment to change the way Supreme Court justices are selected.
Voters will have the option on Aug. 6 of retaining the current merit-based system, or voters can choose to switch to a popular vote system, involving ballot races for a seat on the bench and public-facing campaigns.
If voters choose the popular vote system, the proposed records rule would have to be repealed entirely or significantly modified in subsequent legislation, said Jason Long, a legislative researcher and adviser, during testimony.
The issue is layered, with Democrats advocating for retaining the existing system and many Republicans arguing for a popular vote. Some have added the context that motivations for changing the system could be rooted in dissatisfaction among Republican leadership with Kansas Supreme Court decisions on education and abortion.
Former Chief Justice Marla Luckert announced earlier this month her intention to retire by February, and selecting a replacement is likely to be a monthslong process. Luckert began her time on the bench in 2003 after she was appointed by Republican Gov. Bill Graves. Her retirement will be outgoing Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s fifth appointment to the court, resulting in four sitting justices out of seven on the bench.
Lisa Taylor, a spokesperson for the Kansas Supreme Court, declined to comment on Ney’s allegations and the merits of legislation, citing an inability to discuss policy issues.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/senator-Thompsonb-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-16 15:57:28.450343

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Salt Lake City topped national charts this week under a blanket of the dirtiest air in the country, with more to come. 
Tuesday’s air quality ranked worst in the U.S., according to the National Weather Service. The Utah Department of Environmental Quality’s three-day forecast projects conditions will remain “unhealthy for sensitive groups” through Sunday. 
The Salt Lake Valley’s unique geography, encircled by the Wasatch and Oquirrh mountains, creates an inversion – where cold valley air traps pollution and harmful particles in the valley under a layer of warmer air at higher elevations. Low-pressure weather conditions, including strong storms, are needed to clear an inversion. 
Downtown Salt Lake City is shrouded in a thick pollution haze on Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)
An average Utah winter has “about five to six multi-day inversion episodes on average,” according to the Utah DEQ, and 18 days with high levels of harmful inhalable matter, PM2.5. A longer high-pressure weather system creates more extreme conditions, prolonging the inversion. 
Salt Lake City recommends taking public transit, driving less and reducing idle times to limit contributing to the smog. Transportation contributes almost 50% of wintertime particulate pollution, according to the city’s sustainability website. Solid fuel burning is prohibited during periods of poor air quality.
Health impacts
A Nov. 2020 study from Brigham Young University found air pollution in Utah can decrease median life expectancy by 1.1 to 3.6 years, causing between 2,500 and 8,000 premature deaths each year. Exposure to dirty air increases risk of heart attack, asthma, congestive heart failure, pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
The study also found risk of “stroke, cancer, reproductive harm to mothers and children, mental illness, behavioral dysfunction, immune disease, autism” all increase with prolonged exposure to poor air.

Everyone is vulnerable to negative health effects after exposure to high pollution, according to University of Utah Health, but some populations face a higher risk. Older adults, children, pregnant women, people with underlying heart and lung conditions, and those who work outdoors face a higher risk of severe health complications. 
During times of high pollution, U. Health recommends staying hydrated, limiting outdoor activity, using protective masks outside (such as N95 or N99), and utilizing indoor air purification.
Economic Impacts
The same BYU study estimates Utah’s air pollution costs $1.9 billion annually, citing “healthcare expenses, damage to crops, and lost earning potential,” as well as indirect costs such as “loss of tourism, decreased growth, and regulatory burdens.”
BYU’s study notes that those loss assessments “are on the low end of national estimates, which range up to $9 billion a year for Utah.”

(West Virginia Board of Education livestream Screenshot)The West Virginia Board of Education voted Friday to intervene in the operation of a financially struggling county school district, terminating the superintendent and appointing a replacement. 
Dan Enich’s position as superintendent of the Hancock County Board of Education is vacant as of 4 p.m. Friday, according to a motion made by State Superintendent Michele Blatt and approved by the school board. The state board appointed Walter Saunders to be county superintendent as of 4:01 p.m. Friday. 
Associate state superintendent Jeffrey Kelly said the Hancock County county’s financial shortfalls pose an immediate threat to the ongoing operation of schools.
“Hancock County Schools’ financial situation has escalated from a monitored concern to a fiscal emergency,” he told the school board. “As conditions deteriorated. The district formally requested emergency state aid to meet payroll obligations.”
Uriah Cummings, the state school financial operations officer, told the board that Hancock County had been getting state assistance for financial purposes for three consecutive years as of October. Prior to that, Cummings said, there was nothing to suggest the county had major financial problems.
The county board used funds from its career and technical center to make payroll in September, Cummings said. Those funds were returned to the center, he said.
The county has been operating with 140 more positions than what the county school aid formula called for, according to the state, an overage that costs the county school board about $10 million per year, Cummings told the school board. 
In addition, the school board had numerous construction projects going on, including sports-related projects and had overspent on a construction project at Weir High School by nearly $1 million. 
Those expenses come out to be about an $8 million increase in expenditures from fiscal year 2024 to 2025, he said. 
Enich asked state officials to keep the administration in place and allow officials to continue taking steps under the direction of the state school board. 
“I’m well aware that this has happened under my watch, but would like to add that what I estimate as being the decades-long problem was identified and eliminated under my watch,” Enich said. “And [we] want to be the first ones to fix it, with help and assistance of the Board of Education and any assistance that can be provided our way.”
The Hancock County school board fired Chief Financial Officer Joseph Campinelli in November, according to reporting by West Virginia MetroNews. 
Del. Pat McGeehan, R-Hancock, told West Virginia MetroNews Talkline last week that the financial crisis was caused by mismanagement, a lack of accounting and a number of other issues. Student enrollment has declined in the county just as it has in other parts of the state, he said.
“The books were just wrong, likely just from gross incompetence,” McGeehan said. “Hopefully it’s nothing more than that.”
In the news release Friday, state school board president Paul Hardesty assured Hancock County teachers and school staff members they would be paid, despite concerns the school board can’t make payroll. 
“This board has to make some very tough decisions,” Hardesty said in the news release. “But we must operate within code while also protecting the children and taxpayers of our state. We have told our counties for several years that using one-time COVID money for personnel would lead to a day of reckoning. That day has come in Hancock County.”
The county assistant superintendent and the positions of any personnel serving at the will and pleasure of the county school superintendent will also be vacant as of Friday afternoon, according to the state school board. The assistant county superintendent position will stay vacation in order to conserve resources.
According to the state school board, Saunders has been the director of federal programs and assessment for Ohio County Schools for 10 years. Saunders is an Air Force veteran with an undergraduate degree in mathematics education from West Liberty University and a graduate degree in educational leadership from West Virginia University.
“We are grateful for the service of Mr. Saunders, and we look forward to supporting him and his team to address the crisis in Hancock County,” Blatt said in the news release. “We appreciate the work of the WVBE and know that together, we will resolve the challenges and protect the students and education community of the county.”

Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha over her removal and later return of part of an art display at the Nebraska Capitol.
Sheriff Terry Wagner told the Lincoln Journal Star on Friday that an investigator had been assigned to review evidence related to the incident and conduct interviews. He said his office was looking into whether the incident might fit the definitions of theft, criminal mischief or disturbing the peace.

On the first day of this year’s legislative session, Cavanaugh, a progressive lawmaker in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, removed several frames of artwork in the hallway near her legislative office. The art depicted moments and figures of American history from conservative nonprofit PragerU.
Cavanaugh said she did so because “we are not allowed to adhere anything to walls in the hallway of the Capitol.” She said any such display would typically be placed near the information desk and not in the Capitol’s hallways.
The patrol returned the posters to the Nebraska Capitol Commission, which Speaker John Arch said had approved the display’s use of the walls. The frames were returned to their spots the same day.
The incident got amplified by conservative influencers and media outlets after Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, a Republican, tweeted security footage of the incident and wrote that he was “disappointed in this shameful and selfish bad example.”
Cavanaugh apologized last week as State Sen. Jared Storm of David City asked the Legislature’s Executive Board to reprimand her.

State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, chair of the Legislature’s Executive Board, which handles internal issues of discipline, said the board had discussed the incident at least once. He said he expects the board will advance some formal action against Cavanaugh, but they are waiting to see what the Sheriff’s Office does first.
On Wednesday, Pillen released a statement saying he consulted with law enforcement and legislators, and he “concluded this warrants a criminal investigation by law enforcement.” Pillen said he told the Nebraska State Patrol to refer the materials from the incident to the sheriff’s office.
Wagner told the Journal Star he was surprised to receive the call Wednesday evening and said this may be the first time his office has ever investigated a state senator.
Hansen said he felt the governor was “not unjustified” to call for the investigation considering the nature of the incident.
Cavanaugh declined to comment on the investigation Friday.

According to some reports, explosions were heard in Caracas and other cities near airports and military bases around 2 a.m. (Photo by Jesus Vargas/Getty Images)This week provided more proof that Congress — and our two Kansas senators — are unwilling to check the powers of President Donald Trump. 
A vote in the Senate on Wednesday could have blocked Trump’s ability to conduct further military action in Venezuela without congressional approval. Since Jan. 3, the U.S. has staged a military intervention, removed the president and claimed power over the country’s oil industry. 
The vote narrowly failed, 51-50. 
We are looking at you, Kansas Sens. Jerry Moran and Roger Marshall. 
Kansans might dispute how consequential this vote was, especially compared with other opportunities to slow down Trump. Both senators could have voted against other measures that have inched us closer to an imperial presidency. For instance, both sided with Trump during impeachment votes in his first term. 
Kansans might also argue that the vote on Venezuela was less significant than congressional action on domestic policies, such as deployments of the National Guard or widespread raids by immigration officials. The Kansas senators could have stood up when Trump asserted those powers. (In fact, they still can.) 
Nevertheless, the Venezuela vote is useful as a timely litmus test for Moran and Marshall, both as Republicans and surrogates for their constituents. Wednesday’s vote shows where they sit after almost one year of Trump’s second term. That is to say, on the sidelines. 
To understand this, let’s inspect the conservative coalitions on this vote. Republican ranks broke down into three camps. 
In the first group — let’s call them the Principled Objectors — there were three Republican senators: Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul of Kentucky. Beginning last week, they broke unexpectedly from their party to force the Venezuela roll call vote and stuck by their convictions in the face of public and private threats from Trump. 
Marshall and Moran joining this group would require an extraordinary upgrade to their courage and wild swings to their ideologies. Both have long-term voting records that support the conservative cause. Perhaps it’s fantasy (or folly) to expect this level of resistance. 
In the second group — let’s call them the Equivocaters — there were two Republican senators: Todd Young of Indiana and Josh Hawley of Missouri. 
How do they earn the title of the Equivocaters? After first signaling their hopes of restraining the president, both waffled back to supporting Trump by voting with fellow conservatives. In doing so, they took a position of some courage before retreating, never fully committing themselves. 
We can associate them with equivocation in another way: They insisted on nothing more than weak language from the administration. 
From a statement by Young: “I’ve also received a commitment that if President Trump were to determine American forces are needed in major military operations in Venezuela, the Administration will come to Congress in advance to ask for an authorization of force.” 
Sounds like asking for congressional approval without actually mandating by legislation. 
Hawley said his assurance came from Secretary of State Marco Rubio. 
If you are shaking your head at weak tea that the Equivocaters served, consider the posse that our Kansas senators joined — I call them the Compliant Coalition. Forty-eight Republican senators, including Moran and Marshall, helped Trump get his legislative wish this week with the Venezuelan vote. Vice President JD Vance was needed to break the tie. 
The Compliant Coalition appeases. It cedes power. It responds to threats. It holds its tongue. 
During Congressional votes. During campaigns. During election disputes. And during two Trump administrations. 
Lest the coalition say that they are simply representing the will of the American people, read the polls. According to an Associated Press poll this week, 61 percent of U.S. adults disapprove of how Trump is handling foreign policy, in general. Only 35 percent believe this administration’s intervention has “been about right.” 
Recent polling from Reuters shows how divided and nervous Americans are about Venezuela. Polling from Jan. 4-5 shows Americans almost perfectly split on their approval of US military action to remove the nation’s leader Nicolás Maduro: 33 percent in support, 33 percent don’t know and 34 percent disapprove. 
Asked if they are concerned that the U.S. will get too involved in Venezuela, 72 percent said yes. 
These seem like the exact conditions when a robust Congress — and an empowered Kansas delegation — would want a say. The country is unsure and divided. Our president is volatile and threatening, while also vague about his military intentions. And the administration is pulling a U-turn from its first term, one that kicked off with an inaugural address trumpeting the wisdom of “America First.” 
If not now, if not on this issue, then when does Congress want power?
Perhaps these categories — the Principled Objectors, the Equivocators and the Compliant Coalition — are in flux. Maybe leadership will reel in the rogue Republicans. Maybe the Equivocators will develop further backbone when it comes to balance of powers. 
Or maybe — just maybe — a Republican from the heartland will assert Congressional power and grab the steering wheel. 
After all, we have at least three more years on this highway.

Chad Caldwell’s tagline last session when passing a one-year statewide cellphone ban in schools was “try it before you buy it.”
Now, Caldwell, R-Enid, and the law’s Senate author, Sen. Ally Seifried, R-Claremore, are ready to buy. Both have filed bills that would permanently ban student cellphone use during the school day.
“I think the reason we got to that is because it’s been clear from our educators and from our parents and communities that they want the state to buy it,” Caldwell said. “I think it’s been well received, and it just, to me, makes sense to make that change permanent.”
Caldwell and Seifried said they’ve received an overwhelmingly positive response to the policy, which bars students in public schools from using their cellphones from the morning bell until dismissal.

Under the current law, each school district will have the choice to continue the ban or make a change after the 2025-26 academic year.
Neither lawmaker said they worry many districts would reverse the policy once it becomes optional. Rather, Seifried attributed part of the success to the fact that “the state was the bad guy,” rather than local schools having to take criticism for requiring the ban.
“There is a part of me that (thinks), ‘Maybe having the law gives everyone the sort of cover that they need,’” she said. “There were a couple of conversations that I had that said it was so successful because everyone was all in it together. It was a collective decision. There was no option. It was state law.”
Educators and school leaders have told Oklahoma Voice the policy has had a positive impact by removing a major distraction and that families have been willing to comply because of the equal implementation statewide.
House Bill 3715 from Caldwell and Seifried’s Senate Bill 1719 would strike statutory language allowing local school boards the opportunity to change their district’s cellphone policy after the current academic year. Cellphones and non-school-issued personal electronic devices would be prohibited during the instructional day for “each school year thereafter.”
Both bills will be up for consideration once the 2026 legislative session begins Feb. 2.

Lawmakers and lobbyists will descend on the capital city to build the budget. But crucial election deadlines sit just around the corner. Candidates must declare by Feb. 3 if they wish to participate in New Mexico’s June 2 primary and Nov. 3 midterm elections.
Here’s an overview of campaign activity in the first few weeks of 2026.
Campaign finance and more in the U.S. Congressional races
New Mexico’s three members in the U.S. House of Representatives, all Democrats, each face challengers in the 2026 elections.
In Congressional District 1, which spans from Albuquerque east to Santa Rosa, incumbent Melanie Stansbury thus far will campaign against two Republican challengers: Steve Jones, a former accountant who’s run for congressional seats several times; and Ndidiamaka “Didi” Okpareke, a Rio Rancho pharmacist.
Gabe Vasquez represents Congressional District 2, which covers southern New Mexico along the border, up to the western part of the state and a slice of Albuquerque’s South Valley.
Democratic Socialist Tom Wakely, an Air Force veteran and peace activist in Deming who ran an unsuccessful 2024 campaign as a Green Party member for the U.S. Senate, is challenging Vasquez in the Democratic primary.
So far three Republican challengers have thrown in their names for the swing district (Vasquez held on to his seat in 2024 against a challenge from its former representative, Republican Yvette Herrell).
Those Republican candidates are: Eddy Aragon, a conservative talk radio host and former Albuquerque mayoral candidate; Greg Cunningham, marine veteran, former detective and two-time state legislative candidate; and Jose Orozco, a former contractor with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, and unsuccessful two-time state representative candidate.
Congressional District 3, which spans the state’s northern half and runs along a stretch of its eastern border, is represented by incumbent Teresa Ledger Fernández. She is so far facing one challenger: Republican Rep. Martin Zamora, who was first elected as a state lawmaker in 2019.
In the U.S. Senate, no one has filed yet to challenge Democratic incumbent Ben Ray Luján, who has more than $3.1 million cash on hand, according to federal campaign documents. A “Toby Smith,” from the “Jewish/Christian National Party” — which has no online presence —  filed to run for the seat in October, but with erroneous information (such as using the address from Walter White’s “Breaking Bad” home). The Federal Election Commission already sent a notice to Smith that the filing did not contain a checking account for any campaign donations, which could open an audit or further enforcement.
Forward Party leaders say they’re moving… forward.
Leaders of the New Mexico arm of the Forward Party told Source NM this week they have gathered enough signatures to qualify as a minor party in the state, and also endorsed two Democratic candidates.

The Forward Party — founded by Democrat Andrew Yang after an unsuccessful bid in the 2020 presidential election and former Republican Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey — posits itself as a centrist party focused on a return to civil politics and improving U.S. democracy.
The party is hosting a Southern New Mexico Town hall from noon to 2 p.m. Saturday at the Hotel Encanto in Las Cruces. The town hall will include two endorsed Democratic candidates: gubernatorial candidate for governor Ken Miyagishima, the former Las Cruces mayor; and Tilli Villalobos, a former federal prosecutor running for House District 37.
Deb Haaland announces education platform

Former U.S. Interior Secretary and U.S. Congresswoman Deb Haaland, who is running in the June 2 Democratic primary, promoted her ideas to bolster outdoor learning for K-12 kids, expanding trade pathways in middle schools, continuing universal pre-k and bilingual education and backed by chairs of the House and Senate Education committees, and Picuris Pueblo leadership.
Haaland said she will announce platform policies on affordability, health care and public safety  in the coming weeks. Other candidates in the race include Miyagishima and Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman.

Carrie Sorensen, a Portsmouth Democrat, speaks before the House Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee about her bill seeking to provide diapers to parents on Medicaid. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)A group of lawmakers led by state Rep. Carrie Sorensen wants New Hampshire to become the third U.S. state to cover the cost of diapers for infants under its Medicaid program.
House Bill 1798 would provide eligible families on Medicaid with funding for 100 diapers a month for the first 12 months of an infant’s life. If the bill became law, the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services would have to submit a request — known as a Section 1115 waiver — to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to begin the program because Medicaid is run jointly by the state and federal governments.
In a fiscal note presented to the Legislature, state staff told lawmakers they anticipate roughly 3,600 infants will be eligible and take advantage of the service and put the cost of diapers at 46 cents each. Thus they estimate the program could cost the state $919,000 per year in addition to roughly $1.07 million that the federal government would provide annually for the program. For reference, New Hampshire’s entire Medicaid program is projected to spend $2.57 billion in the state’s fiscal year 2025 with 56% of that coming from the federal government. HB 1798 appropriates $100,000 a year for the program, but gives the governor the authority to pull more money as needed.
Sorensen, a Portsmouth Democrat and mother, framed the bill as a way to help new mothers with the financial burden of raising an infant. She noted that SNAP — the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — doesn’t cover diapers and that new mothers are regularly facing high costs.
“I can personally attest to this,” she said. “You all heard my baby in the House last year.”
Sorensen argued low-income families are forced to ration diapers, which can lead to urinary tract infections and other medical complications from children not being changed often enough.
“Low-income parents have to make more difficult choices of whether they spend their money on diapers or whether they spend money on food or their heat or their rent,” she said. “Or do they ration diapers, risking their skin and their health? Neither choice is acceptable for a child’s well-being.”
Sorensen said she considered having her bill provide reusable diapers, but decided to go with disposable diapers because of the complications for families that use laundromats. 
In 2024, Delaware and Tennessee became the first states in the country to cover diapers under Medicaid after CMS approved their requests.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/diapersbill-1024x534.jpg,,,2026-01-16 14:57:19.150798

Gino Bulso, a Brentwood Republican, is okay with first cousins getting married but not with same sex couples. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)New acquaintances, when finding out that I’m a journalist, often ask what beat I cover. 
My response is that as editor, I rarely write news stories but as the creator of a regular column, I choose to focus on the hypocrisy beat. 
God knows there’s no shortage of hypocritical behavior from Tennessee’s lawmakers and politicians, and I’m pretty sure I could churn out columns about it on a weekly basis. 
It’s still early in 2026, but in the last week, two lawmakers — one at the state level, one at the federal — showed they aren’t wasting any time indulging in hypocritical hijinks. 
Rep. Gino Bulso 
In first place for the Hypocrite of the Month is Rep. Gino Bulso, a Brentwood Republican. 
Two years ago, Bulso made headlines when he became the only member of the Tennessee House of Representatives to vote against a measure prohibiting marriage between first cousins. That Republicans and Democrats could agree on even something that seems like a no-brainer is rare in a chamber so deeply cloven by partisan division that it’s doubtful a proclamation recognizing Santa Claus would earn bipartisan support. 
Bulso gave an impassioned defense of the practice, informing his colleagues that his grandparents, who immigrated from Italy, were first cousins who came to Tennessee from Ohio because it was legal for them to marry in the Volunteer State. 
Stockard on the Stump: Bulso doubles down for first-cousin marriage

I’m not here to shame Bulso for his ancestors’ behavior: none of us can be held accountable for what previous generations did, and I’m certainly not privy to the social mores of small town Italy, from whence his grandparents immigrated, in the early 20th century. 
But Bulso has no shame about litigating and legislating how others should lead their lives, and with the legislative session just kicking off, he’s already filed three bills targeting LGBTQ+ Tennesseans. 
One measure, House Bill 1473, would render Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that made same-sex marriage the law of the land. Obergefell guaranteed the right through both the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection and Due Process clauses and required states to perform and recognize same sex marriages. 
At the time in 2024 when Bulso took his stand for first cousin marriage, he made plain his view on same-sex marriage, saying that Obergefell “was a grievously wrong decision.” He also made the bizarre claim that the ruling should also protect marriage between cousins: if the 14th Amendment offers protections to same-sex couples, it should also offer the same protections to cousin couples, he said. 
Now, apparently, he sees no need to follow the Constitution at all and why should he? Failure to abide by the Constitution is all the rage among senior Republicans, chiefly President Donald Trump setting an example. 
Honorable mention: U.S. Rep. David Kustoff
I’ve subscribed to U.S. Rep. David Kustoff’s newsletters for several years, and he’s one of the state’s more reasonable congressmen, rarely making hay out of culture issues and typically focusing on community events and meetings.
But in his Sunday newsletter, he highlighted a recent appearance on Fox News. 
“I joined Rich Edson on Fox News Live to discuss the fraud in Minnesota. Governor Tim Walz has a lot of excuses. When it comes to waste and fraud, taxpayers deserve answers,” Kustoff wrote, referring to allegations of fraud in state social service programs.
First, the fraud is alleged. 
U.S. Rep. David Kustoff touting his appearance on Fox News. (Screenshot from Kustoff’s newsletter.)
But secondly, I feel sure there are already plenty of politicians on top of the Minnesota fraud investigations — clearly, it’s become a raison d’etre for the Trump administration, which has virtually occupied Minneapolis — and Walz, who, while not running for office again, surely does not want his legacy to be one of unchecked fraud. 
Perhaps, instead of devoting his energy to another state’s governor, Kustoff should turn his eyes toward Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee. 
Of late, Lee declined to accept $84 million in federal funds for a summer food program for kids. All he had to do was have the state express their intent to take the funds — no application necessary — but for the second year in a row, he did not. And he provided no comment as to why. 
Mind you, Tennesseans are already paying federal taxes for this program, among the other programs our taxes cover. I’d call it fraud of a sort that we can’t reap benefits from the taxes we’ve paid, while other states are getting these federal dollars. 
Yet, I’ve heard not a peep from Kustoff, or other members of Tennessee’s federal delegation. 
Tennessee’s Republican lawmakers are fond of posting verses from the Bible on their social media feeds each Sunday, usually apropos of nothing. 
I know my Bible, too, so let me offer a verse that is apt for Bulso and Kustoff. 
The Book of Matthew, Chapter 7, verses 3-5 says, in the New King James translation: “And why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye, but do not consider the plank in your own eye?”
Or, to put in the Tennessee translation, don’t be such a dang hypocrite.

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The University of Arkansas’ reversal of its offer to hire Emily Suski as its next law school dean has sparked concerns that the decision chills faculty’s free speech.
The university said it was withdrawing the offer after key Republicans raised concerns about Suski’s background and legal positions on transgender athletes.
The Fayetteville school is the latest to be embroiled in a debate over academic freedom as Republicans nationwide focus on college curricula. 
Here’s what to know about what’s happened at the UA:
 
Who is Emily Suski?
Suski is a professor and associate dean at University of South Carolina’s Joseph F. Rice School of Law. Her areas of expertise include education law, particularly Title IX and civil rights in public schools, according to her USC biography. 
She holds degrees from Georgetown University Law Center and the University of North Carolina. 
She’s spoken regularly in public and been quoted in multiple media outlets about Title IX. When she was hired, the UA praised Suski’s “extensive experience” in legal education and the practice of law.

Why did the university reverse course?
The university announced to law school faculty on Wednesday that it had changed its mind, saying it “decided to go a different direction in filling the vacancy.”
The university said it had heard from “key external stakeholders” before its abrupt decision. Though university officials haven’t identified those stakeholders, top Republicans have said they raised concerns about Suski.
 
What were Republicans’ complaints? 
Republicans who have said they were concerned about Suski include Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester and Attorney General Tim Griffin. Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders hasn’t said whether she intervened, but released a statement applauding the university for its decision away from Suski.
Hester has said he objected to Suski signing on to a friend-of-the-court brief along with other law professors. The brief was on behalf of attorneys challenging laws prohibiting transgender athletes in school sports.
Hester also cited a 2022 letter Suski signed with other professors in support of Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Joe Biden’s pick for the U.S. Supreme Court.
 
What has Suski said?
Suski has said she was disappointed by the university’s decision and the influence outside critics had. 
“I have been informed that the decision was not in any way a reflection of my qualifications to serve as dean, but rather the result of influence from external individuals,” Suski said in a statement released Thursday night. “Questions concerning that feedback are best directed to the University of Arkansas.”
 
What do critics of UA’s decision say?
The decision has prompted criticism from Democratic lawmakers and advocates around the country, who say it sends a dangerous message to professors.
An official with the American Association of University Professors called the university’s decision move “really chilling.” Other groups criticizing the move include the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas and the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.
 
What happens next?
It’s unclear what the next moves are for the University of Arkansas and its search for a new law school dean. 
UA spokesperson John Thomas said, to his knowledge, nothing like this has happened at the law school previously. 
“Next steps for the search are still being determined. Beyond that, we have nothing further to add at this time,” Thomas said.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20260115_UALawSchool3_Grajeda-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-16 14:57:19.150798

Los legisladores progresistas y sus aliados en los sectores laboral y de la salud parecen tener la esperanza de que Newsom apoye una idea de financiación diferente y poco viable.,"This article is also available in English. Read it here.
Los activistas de la atención médica de California, los sindicatos y los legisladores progresistas han instado al gobernador y a la Legislatura a encontrar nuevos fondos para financiar la atención médica y otros servicios sociales para millones de californianos de bajos ingresos y discapacitados.
 Su coalición, conocida como “Lucha por nuestra salud”, exigió el miércoles en las escaleras del Capitolio que la Legislatura y el gobernador Gavin Newsom, que pronto dejará el poder, tomen medidas para compensar los recortes de fondos que el presidente Donald Trump y los republicanos aprobaron el año pasado.
 El dilema sobre cómo responder a los miles de millones de dólares en recortes a los servicios sociales —en particular al presupuesto de Medi-Cal, el programa de Medicaid del estado de casi 200 mil millones de dólares— presagia un enfrentamiento que dominará tanto la sesión legislativa de 2026 como las elecciones de mitad de período.
 Mientras un sindicato impulsa una controvertida propuesta de ley sobre el impuesto al patrimonio para compensar los recortes, los demócratas progresistas en la Legislatura están proponiendo un impuesto corporativo independiente, aunque los detalles son escasos. Si esto se materializa en un proyecto de ley, es probable que también divida al partido, sensible a las acusaciones de que los californianos pagan impuestos excesivos y que recientemente ha declarado que sus líderes se centrarán en reducir los costos para los residentes del estado.
En su último año como gobernador, Newsom se enfrenta a un tira y afloja entre dos opciones políticamente costosas: aumentar los impuestos o permitir que caduquen los beneficios de millones de californianos de bajos ingresos y con discapacidad. Aunque su administración solo ha buscado culpar a Trump por los recortes federales, los activistas de la salud dejaron claro que presionarán a Newsom para que ayude a prevenir una pérdida drástica de la cobertura.
 “Quiero dirigirme al gobernador y a la Legislatura estatal”, dijo Judy Mark, presidenta de Disability Voices United, desde la escalinata del Capitolio. “Sabemos que ustedes no son responsables de estos terribles recortes, pero ahora la responsabilidad recae en sus manos. Tienen el poder de protegernos”.
El gobernador enfureció a los activistas de la salud al no incluir fondos para compensar por los recortes en su propuesta de presupuesto estatal , la cual reconoce que decenas de miles de personas perderán cobertura y considera menos servicios entre los ahorros proyectados. Este año, el estado comenzó a congelar las nuevas inscripciones a Medi-Cal para adultos inmigrantes indocumentados debido al aumento de los costos del programa, a pesar de las objeciones de progresistas y activistas.  
 Los analistas de Newsom prevén que unos 522,000 californianos perderán su cobertura de Medi-Cal en el año fiscal 2026-2027, cifra que aumentará a 1.8 millones en el futuro. Su administración ha afirmado que el estado simplemente no tiene los fondos para cubrir la cobertura de quienes sean excluidos del programa debido a las nuevas leyes federales.
Un sindicato, el Sindicato Internacional de Empleados de Servicios-Trabajadores de la Salud Unidos Oeste o  Service Employees International Union–United Healthcare Workers West, ha propuesto una iniciativa de ley que impondría un impuesto al patrimonio a los multimillonarios de California para ayudar a cubrir los aproximadamente 30 mil millones de dólares que el estado perdería anualmente debido a la ley de impuestos y gastos de Trump. Los promotores afirman que el impuesto único del 5% generaría unos 100 mil millones de dólares para el sistema de salud estatal. Aproximadamente el 10% de los fondos recaudados se reservaría para las escuelas públicas.
Pero Newsom se opone a la medida, que aún no ha sido aprobada para ser sometida a votación, pero que ya ha generado inquietud en Sacramento y Silicon Valley.

 Los multimillonarios son cruciales para el presupuesto estatal
La propuesta ha generado una oleada de oposición. Los fundadores de Google, Larry Page y Sergey Brin, supuestamente habrían intentado trasladar algunas entidades comerciales fuera de California, mientras que otras compañías amenazan con irse. Estrategas demócratas cercanos a Newsom están organizando un comité de campaña para derrotar la medida mientras el sindicato recopila las casi 900,000 firmas necesarias para que se presente en las elecciones de noviembre.
Newsom, quien se ha opuesto repetidamente a las propuestas estatales de impuesto al patrimonio, declaró esta semana a Politico que ha estado presionando personalmente a los promotores de la medida para que la abandonen, debido a la preocupación de que pueda llevar a los millonarios a  taxar a salir de California. Además, el gobernador mantiene vínculos personales de larga data con muchos de los gigantes tecnológicos que probablemente estarían sujetos a la propuesta de impuesto al patrimonio, y tiene motivos para mantenerlos cerca: son posibles donantes en caso de que se presente a la previsible candidatura presidencial tras finalizar su mandato como gobernador este año.
 Aunque los progresistas presionan a Newsom para que aumente los ingresos y refuerce Medi-Cal, pocos han apoyado la propuesta del impuesto al patrimonio, y la mayoría se mantiene expectante. Tampoco critican la oposición de Newsom, una posible señal de que los legisladores liberales esperan que esté dispuesto a buscar otros fondos para la atención médica.
El portavoz de Newsom, Izzy Gardon, se negó a comentar si el gobernador consideraría propuestas fiscales alternativas.
 Los defensores de la salud afirmaron que la sustitución de la financiación federal sería una prioridad clave en esta sesión legislativa. Los legisladores progresistas, que lideraron la oposición a la propuesta de Newsom de recortar costos congelando Medi-Cal para inmigrantes indocumentados , han señalado que también se sumarán a la lucha.

(File photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)As the South Carolina General Assembly reconvened this week, lawmakers did so in the wake of a major joint state and federal law enforcement operation that exposed the scale of illicit activity taking place in smoke shops across the state.
“Operation Ganjapreneur” resulted in the seizure of large quantities of illegal THC products and the arrest of multiple individuals on narcotics-related charges. More importantly, it revealed how
openly and routinely illegal products are being sold in communities across South Carolina, often with little consequence for retailers.
The operation underscored a troubling reality: many of the unregulated products sold in smoke shops are tied to broader illicit supply chains that strain law enforcement resources and pose real threats to public safety.
While federal law already prohibits many of these products, gaps in state law have limited the ability of local officers to act.
That enforcement gap has allowed an illicit vape market to flourish in plain sight.
Flavored disposable vapes are mass produced overseas, smuggled into the United States, and sold openly despite clear federal prohibitions. The result is a growing public health and safety crisis that state and local law enforcement currently lack the authority to fully address.
Roughly 90% of disposable vapes sold in the United States are manufactured in China, where they are banned for domestic sale. Many have been explicitly denied authorization by the Food and Drug Administration, a decision upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Yet anyone can walk into smoke shops across South Carolina and find rows of these illegal devices, marketed openly and aggressively to kids. This is not accidental. It is a business model built around exploiting enforcement loopholes.
The consequences are increasingly visible in communities across the state.
Nearly half of South Carolina teenagers now report using disposable vapes. Parents, teachers, and school administrators see the impact every day in classrooms, hallways, and parking lots.
Devices are disguised as pens, USB drives, toys, or school supplies. Flavors like cotton candy, bubblegum, and pink lemonade are designed to hook young users early. These products are sold with no testing, no oversight, and no accountability.
Despite these realities, enforcement remains limited. Federal agencies cannot police every storefront, and current state law does not clearly empower local law enforcement to remove illegal vapes from shelves or hold retailers accountable.
Without explicit authority, officers’ hands are tied, allowing bad actors to continue operating with near impunity.
Congress has recognized the scope of the problem and responded by allocating $200 million in federal funding specifically for illicit vape enforcement. Those resources are intended to support
states that align their laws with federal standards and partner in coordinated enforcement efforts.
For South Carolina to fully access those funds and participate in meaningful enforcement operations, state law must change.
Legislation currently under consideration, Senate Bill 287, would close this gap. The bill aligns state authority with federal law and gives the attorney general, as well as state and local law enforcement, the tools they need to identify illegal products, remove them from store shelves, and hold retailers accountable.
It passed the South Carolina Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support and rests on the floor of the House.
Opposition from some smoke shop operators has focused on claims of unfairness or economic harm. But that argument ignores a basic question: Why should any business be allowed to profit
from selling products that violate federal law and deliberately target children?
Enforcement does not punish lawful retailers. It protects communities, supports legitimate businesses, and restores order to a market that has spiraled out of control.
South Carolina now faces a clear choice. It can continue to allow illegal vapes to flood its communities, putting kids at risk and leaving law enforcement powerless. Or it can act decisively, align state law with federal standards through S.287, and shut down an illicit pipeline that has operated unchecked for far too long.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IMG_8239-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-16 14:57:19.150798

(Photo by Mike Salerno/Rhode Island Current)A former Senate Majority leader whose opposition to legalizing same sex marriage over a decade ago drew renewed scrutiny last summer is one of four attorneys Gov. Dan McKee nominated Friday to lifetime appointments to Rhode Island’s courts.
The nominees were made to fill vacancies in Superior, District and Family courts. Each will require vetting by the Rhode Island Senate, where chamber President Valarie Lawson said hearings are still being scheduled.
“Today, I am nominating four experienced judges to serve our state’s judicial system,” McKee said in a statement. “Each brings qualifications and perspectives that will contribute to the effective administration of justice in Rhode Island.”
The most high-profile name on the list is Michael McCaffrey, a Warwick Democrat who served as the Senate’s majority leader from 2017 through the end of the 2022 legislative session. A practicing lawyer since 1989, McCaffrey is a partner at his private practice in Warwick.
McCaffrey’s candidacy drew outrage from nearly a dozen speakers who testified against a potential appointment during his July 8 interview before the state’s Judicial Nominating Commission over his opposition to legalizing same-sex marriage in Rhode Island in 2013.
Judicial Nominating Commission forwards five names to McKee for District Court opening

During his July interview with the commission, McCaffrey said his understanding of such social issues “has evolved” and promised his past political influences would not impact any decision if he became a judge.
Lawson, who was first elected to the Senate in 2018, endorsed McCaffrey, saying he has “the highest integrity, a deep knowledge of the law, and a fair-minded demeanor that will serve our state well.”
“I had the honor of working alongside Michael McCaffrey in the Senate for several years,” she said in a statement to Rhode Island Current. “He is a dedicated and distinguished public servant who is exceptionally well qualified for the District Court bench.”
If confirmed, McCaffrey would fill the District Court vacancy created by Melissa R. DuBose, who now serves as a judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The annual base salary for a District Court judge is $199,075.
Picked to fill a Providence County Superior Court opening made following Judge Daniel A. Procaccini’s retirement May 31 is Assistant Attorney General Shannon Signore. A graduate of the Roger Williams School of Law, Signore has worked for the AG’s Office since 2002 where she now works in its Special Victims Unit.
Signore was a 2016 Beau Biden Foundation Fellow and was recognized with the Crime Victim Service Award in 2019.
A Superior Court seat comes with a $205,567 base salary.
McKee is recommending two Family Court appointments to fill  vacancies left by the retirements of judges Debra E. DiSegna and Patricia K. Asquith last year.
Picked to fill DiSegna’s seat is Andrea Iannazzi, a graduate of Suffolk University who has served as a magistrate for the Family Court since 2017. McKee’s office notes Iannazzi previously worked as a staff lawyer and mediator in the Rhode Island Family Court system and served as Gov. Gina Raimondo’s deputy counsel and as counsel to her campaign.
She also served on the Cranston School Committee for a decade.
Magistrate Alberto Aponte Cardona Sr., was picked by McKee to replace Asquith. A U.S. Army veteran and 2004 graduate of the Roger Williams School of Law, Cardona was the first Latino appointed to the Family Court bench in 2019.
He is a former assistant city solicitor in Central Falls who has served on the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights and is an active member of the Blackstone Valley Advocacy Center’s board of directors.
Both Family Court seats come with a base salary of $205,567.

Listening to families, to health care providers and to experts. That principle guided my approach as an elected leader, and it guides my work with Immunize Colorado today.
Colorado recorded 36 measles cases in 2025, far exceeding the total number of cases from the previous decade. Five people have been hospitalized. Cases have appeared in 10 of our 64 counties, from Mesa County in the west to the Front Range. That may not seem like many, but for an infectious disease that can spread quickly, any uptick in numbers is cause for concern. In some of our rural communities, health officials worry the disease may be spreading undetected.

Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, but now we are at risk of losing that status. While it may feel like a technicality, this is an important indicator of the health of a country and how safe it is for children and families.
This is preventable. Vaccines are safe and effective and one of the best ways parents can protect their children.
Unfortunately, families today are receiving dangerous mixed signals about vaccines. In early January, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, under Housing and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., announced it would be changing the childhood immunization schedule, reducing the number of diseases the CDC recommends vaccinating against from 17 to 11. This change was not because of new scientific evidence or eradication of diseases. It was against the recommendation of the health care community, and it will have serious impacts on generations of American children.
Families deserve better than this. Parents deserve accurate information from trusted sources, which should include our nation’s health agencies. Here’s what the evidence actually shows: Routine childhood vaccinations have prevented an estimated 508 million illnesses and over 1.1 million deaths among American children born between 1994 and 2023.
I talk with Colorado parents regularly, and I know what they want: real information to make the best decisions for their children. They trust their doctors and nurses to give them recommendations backed by science.
Elected leaders should be reinforcing that trust, not undermining it. They should be supporting the health care providers and local public health departments doing the hard work in communities across Colorado, and the country, not creating confusion that makes that work harder.
Colorado families are counting on our elected officials to put children over politics. That means following the science, listening to the experts, and speaking up for vaccine access.
We owe it to our children to keep them safe and healthy, and leaders, like our members of Congress, must do the same. Not staying silent while RFK Jr. creates confusion for Coloradans and our children pay the price.

Ilhan Omar helped organize a hearing including dozens of Democratic members of Congress on Friday, Jan. 16, in St. Paul to discuss the immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota. (Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)Immigrants, activists and local politicians on Friday implored members of Congress to use their influence to stop the violent arrests conducted by federal immigration officers who have flooded Minnesota under President Donald Trump’s immigration agenda.
Dozens of members of Congress gathered in Minnesota to hear on-the-ground testimony and bear witness to how federal agents have menaced Minnesotans in recent weeks, especially Somalis and Latinos. But they also learned of how immigration agents’ actions have hardened Minnesotans’ resolve to fight for their constitutional rights.
Immigration raids are resulting in injuries, idling vehicles left in the streets, abandoned dogs wandering through neighborhoods and destruction of property, testifiers said. Agents are also scanning the streets for Minnesotans of color and asking for their papers.
“People are walking around on the street with their passports. That’s not American. That’s the furthest thing from it,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey told the federal lawmakers. “Please take back to your respective constituencies and your colleagues the message of, if you love your own community, do not let this happen in ours.”
Friday’s hearing was not a formal hearing, but the sixth in a series conducted by U.S. House Democrats to highlight the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts. The committee also invited both Minnesota Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith. No Republicans attended.
Newly elected St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, who came to the U.S. as a refugee from Laos, told the committee that advisors recommended she carry her passport in case she gets stopped by federal agents. Her’s parents, who are U.S. citizens, are afraid to leave their homes for fear that their “neighbors would tell (federal agents) that that house was an Asian house.”
Trump has used fraud in Minnesota’s public programs to attack Minnesota’s Somali-American community and justify sending 3,000 immigration agents to the state.
Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations of Minnesota, said many Somali Minnesotans are afraid to send their children to school, and elders are carrying immigration documents to their mosque.
“Do your job. Stand up for the Constitution of the American people. Our lives depend on it,” Hussein said.
Emilia Gonzalez Avalos, executive director of Unidos Minnesota, said the immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota have caused many to distrust the federal government.
“People should not have to worry that an encounter with a masked, armed federal agent could cost them their lives. This is not about whether immigration law exists. This is about how power is exercised,” Gonzalez Avalos said.
A lawsuit filed Thursday by the American Civil Liberties Union alleges immigration authorities are racially profiling Minnesota residents and detaining people with legal status, including citizens. Minnesota and the Twin Cities are also suing the Trump administration to stop the immigration surge.
U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu of California encouraged Minnesotans to keep documenting the unlawful actions of federal agents and noted that the statute of limitations for violations of federal law is five years.
“While this administration may not hold anyone accountable, I guarantee you a future administration will,” Lieu said. “All of us are here today to let the people in Minnesota know that you are not alone, that the Constitution protects you and you are on the right side of history.”
In D.C., Congress is rushing to pass annual appropriations by the end of January to avoid another government shutdown.
U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan hinted that House Democrats may use the actions of federal agents in Minnesota, including the killing of Renee Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross, as leverage in the upcoming budget battle.
“We have passed policies to tell them not to do ICE actions in front of schools, health centers, funerals … but we still have violations,” Tlaib said. “When Speaker (Mike) Johnson says ICE is doing what it was created to do, remember this when the funding comes up next week.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ilhan--scaled-e1768590794467-1024x666.jpg,,,2026-01-16 14:57:19.150798

John Carney from 2017 to 2025, including education policy adviser, chief of policy and deputy chief of staff.
Sheehan’s nomination is pending confirmation by the Delaware State Senate, and once approved, he would assume leadership of the State Board for the Redding Consortium decision.
DOVER, Del. Gov. Matt Meyer has nominated longtime education policy adviser Jon Sheehan to serve as president of the Delaware State Board of Education, positioning a veteran public servant to lead the board as it prepares to weigh a major school governance decision in northern New Castle County.
Sheehan’s nomination, announced Thursday, comes as the State Board of Education is expected in the coming months to review a pending redistricting proposal from the Redding Consortium, a multi-district body established under state law to recommend changes to school attendance boundaries.
The nomination requires confirmation by the Delaware State Senate.
“Jon Sheehan understands that strong public education is the foundation of a strong Delaware,” Meyer said in a statement. “He brings the rare combination of classroom experience, policy expertise and steady leadership that this role demands.”
Extensive education and policy background
Sheehan recently joined the University of Delaware’s Biden Institute as interim executive director. Before that, he served as senior adviser and deputy chief of staff for strategic operations in Meyer’s administration, working closely with cabinet agencies on education, workforce development and children’s policy.
He also served in a series of senior roles under former Gov. John Carney from 2017 to 2025, including education policy adviser, chief of policy and deputy chief of staff. During that time, Sheehan helped oversee implementation of Delaware’s Every Student Succeeds Act plan, coordinated education and childcare policy during the COVID-19 pandemic, and advanced initiatives such as Pathways 2.0 and the Wilmington Learning Collaborative.
Earlier in his career, Sheehan worked for the New York City Department of Education in family and community engagement and began his professional career as a fifth-grade teacher.
Why the timing matters
The president of the State Board of Education is one of seven voting members but holds additional leadership responsibilities, including setting meeting agendas, presiding over hearings and guiding the board’s regulatory and appeals processes.
Those duties take on added significance as the board prepares to consider the Redding Consortium’s pending school boundary proposal. Under state law, once a consortium submits a plan, the State Board must vote to approve or reject it within a defined timeframe.
The issue has taken on heightened visibility after Meyer publicly called for acceptance of the Redding Consortium’s recommendation during remarks Monday at the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce’s annual dinner, signaling the administration’s position ahead of the board’s formal review.
If approved by the State Board, the proposal would advance to the General Assembly for consideration through a joint resolution and then to the governor for final action. If rejected, the board must issue written findings, and the consortium would have an opportunity to revise and resubmit its proposal.
As board president, Sheehan would oversee the review process, preside over the board’s vote and serve as the primary public spokesperson as the decision moves through the state approval process.
Reaction from education leaders
Monica Moriak, president of the Christina School District Board of Education, said Sheehan brings both experience and a collaborative approach to the role.
“Jon is an experienced policymaker who understands education and knows we must improve our education system,” Moriak said. “He’s open to ideas and input from others, and he’s a good leader.”
What’s next
Sheehan’s nomination is pending confirmation by the Delaware State Senate. If approved, he would assume leadership of the State Board during a period of heightened public attention to education policy, school funding and district governance across the state.
Sheehan holds a master’s degree in teaching from Fordham University and a bachelor’s degree in government from Wesleyan University.

It happened in Illinois in 2008, after then-governor Rod Blagojevich slashed $55 million from the state budget that was intended to fund substance abuse prevention programs and treatment centers. 
At the time, Howe was employed by the Illinois Association for Behavioral Health, a statewide organization that represents agencies that focus on prevention, treatment and recovery for addiction.

“I know of people who were thrown out of treatment who did not survive,” Howe said. “I saw it firsthand. I lived it and it was devastating.” 
Howe is currently chief executive officer of Addiction Professionals of North Carolina, a trade association for substance use professionals and providers. She spoke to NC Newsline just as the Trump administration reversed its sudden decision to terminate $2 billion in funding for drug addiction treatment and prevention programs.
The federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) sent letters to service providers late Tuesday night, announcing that several critical federal grants supporting mental health and substance abuse prevention services were being terminated effective immediately “due to a shift in federal priorities.”
In North Carolina, the loss of the federal grants would have affected several programs funded by that money through the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS).
“It was eerily similar to what I saw and what I lived in Illinois,” Howe said. 
Howe’s organization receives funding through NCDHHS from one of the substance abuse prevention grants that was targeted for termination. She said it would have been “devastating” for service providers and patients. 
“It was really a wholesale decimation of the system, and I don’t say that lightly or hyperbolically,” Howe said. “When we started talking to our members, these grant terminations cut across every part of the system.”
Just as suddenly, SAMSHA sent a second letter Wednesday night reinstating the grants, but didn’t provide an explanation for the abrupt reversal. 
 “Your award will remain active under its original terms and conditions,” SAMHSA told service providers. “Please disregard the prior termination notice and continue program activities as outlined in your award agreement.”
The reversal came as a huge relief to Howe and other providers. But the chaos created by the federal move left many of them shaken and worried about the Trump administration’s commitment to their mission. 
“That’s a concern because the work we do directly saves lives,” she said. 
Howe said it forced service providers to consider tough decisions. “Providers in Illinois had to consider the same types of decisions that our providers were making yesterday,” she said. “Who do we lay off? What services do we close down? Who do we get rid of?” 
Cutting funding for drug treatment would impede the administration’s goal of stopping the flow of drugs into America, Howe said. 
“You can stop the supply all you want, but if you do not address demand, you’re not going to fix it,” Howe said. “Where there is demand, there is a supply. It’s street economic principles. I think we have to work hand in hand and recognize that we need both.”
Amy Brundle (Photo: NAMI NC)
Amy Brundle, director of marketing and communications for the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) NC, said the decision to restore the $2 billion in grants was a welcome surprise. “But we really shouldn’t need to be having this conversation at all because these grants have already been approved by Congress,” Brundle said.
NAMI NC provides education and support programming to people with mental health disorders and their families. It also works to raise public awareness around mental health-related issues and how they impact people in North Carolina. 
Brundle said that “boots on the ground organizations” providing community support and direct service are meeting a need by helping to make sure that people are “alive and safe and able to function and thrive in society.”
The federal grant NAMI NC received was not targeted for termination, Brundle said, but many of the organizations the group works with would have been affected.
“Without them, I don’t really want to think too deeply about what the impacts would have been,” Brundle said. “We’re talking about catastrophic impacts over time.” 
NCDHHS grants that would have been impacted include: 

NC Healthy Transitions for Youth and Young Adults with Serious Mental Disorders
FY2023 Strategic Prevention Framework – Partnerships for Success for States (North Carolina)
North Carolina Grants to Prevent Prescription Drug/Opioid Overdose-Related Deaths (PDO)
North Carolina Strategic Prevention Framework for Prescription Drugs (SPF-Rx)  
NC System of Care Expansion: Focus on Governance Development and High-Fidelity Wraparound Program 

Brundle said the loss of federal funding for those programs would have created severe hardships for people with mental illnesses who rely on grant-funded health care providers for treatment.   
“Without these organizations being fully funded to do their work, there would be no community support for mental health, and not everything can be thrown back on the healthcare system,” Brundle said. “Organizations like ours exist for a reason.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/drugs_gettyimages-1004637310-1024x6271768496806-darwin_brandis__istock_getty_images_plus_720-1.jpg,,,2026-01-16 14:57:19.150798

The latest proposal would create a new 3% sales tax on alcoholic beverages, according to one of the bill’s architects, Rep. Cristina Parajón, D-Albuquerque, while preserving the existing excise taxes that alcohol distributors are assessed based on the volume of alcohol they sell.
That is half the 6% levy Parajón and co-sponsors sought last session. “We think the proposal that we have this year is of the most reasonable,” she told the audience of a recent town hall meeting in Albuquerque.

For decades, excess drinking has been a top killer of working-age New Mexicans. In the latest estimates, a third of the deaths are attributable to acute causes like alcohol-fueled violence or vehicle crashes, and two-thirds are due to chronic causes such as liver disease and cancer.
New Mexico’s death rate declined 20% from a peak in 2021, according to the health department, but remains above pre-pandemic levels, underscoring an emergency which the state’s leaders have paid lip-service to but taken few steps to address.


Among the most effective ways of reducing demand for alcohol is increasing its price, according to public health experts, and raising alcohol taxes are the typical means of doing so. New Mexico’s existing alcohol taxes, which do not adjust for inflation, are at a 30-year low — between 4¢ and 7¢ per drink, depending on the type of beverage.In each legislative session since 2022, lawmakers have introduced bills to lift those rates. Each time, even as they have broadened their coalition and moderated their request, they have fallen short. Time and again, a wide spectrum of businesses that sell alcohol — from brewers to wholesalers to restaurants and even gas stations — has fought off the measures.In 2025, Parajón worked closely with Micaela Lara Cadena, D-Mesilla, vice chair of the House tax committee, but that is still where the bill died, after two Democrats voted against it.
The pair — Patricia Lundstrom, D-Gallup, and Doreen Gallegos, D-Las Cruces — both had ties to the alcohol industry and afterwards, Cadena took the unusual step of speaking out against what she perceived as her colleagues’ conflicts of interest.
During an interim committee hearing in October, Cadena seemed more determined, and said her duty as a lawmaker “is to our people, not to the alcohol lobbyist or industry or what they determine or decide.”
Lundstrom, on the other hand, remained unconvinced. McKinley County, which she represents and which has long struggled with high rates of alcohol dependency, is allowed to tax alcohol 5%, which she said was “a good thing.” But she was skeptical of imposing such measures statewide. “I’m not going to add more taxes on to McKinley County if I don’t see a clear path,” she said.
At last weekend’s town hall, when Parajón was asked whether the new bill had a better chance of passing the committee, she hedged. “I can’t really speak to how representatives are going to vote, especially when a new bill is brought forward.”
There is a precedent for adding a 3% sales tax: Maryland did exactly that 2011. In the years that followed, multiple studies found the change reduced alcohol–related harms.
At the town hall, another bill sponsor Sen. Antoinette Sedillo Lopez, D-Albuquerque, acknowledged the lawmakers had lowered their ambitions as they sought a bill they could pass. On a $2 beer at a convenience store, for example a 3% tax comes to little more than a nickel.
“How many of you would support paying five cents for a drink?” she asked the audience, who responded with a round of applause.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention long ranked New Mexico’s alcohol-related death rate the highest in the nation but it no longer does — because last year the Trump administration dissolved the agency’s alcohol unit, and disbanded its staff.
New Mexico Health Department communications coordinator David Barre said states were sharing data with each other to make such comparisons, “but it’s a work in progress.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/parajon-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-16 14:57:19.150798

Though some previous concerns have been raised about the number of attorneys that have cycled through the office since the former longtime Republican lawmaker took over the Attorney General’s Office in 2021, the finance compliance audit of Fiscal Years 2023 and 2024 raised concerns turnover was also high among the financial services staff, which oversees $184 million of revenue in motor vehicle license and permit revenue.
That turnover has led to errors and auditors found those years’ financial statements “continue to contain errors” and they said those “continue as a result of staff turnover in key positions.”
In fact, the report notes that while the Attorney General’s Office has undergone a number of reorganizations under Knudsen, the Centralized Services Division eliminated the Chief Financial Officer position. In addition to that, five of the eight positions in that division turned over in 2024, with the effects still reverberating in 2025, according to the audit report.
“Control deficiencies described in (four of the) recommendations are partially due to experience levels of current staff and a lack of use or documentation of internal controls,” the audit said.
The audit outlined how cash was misstated in various state accounts “due to inappropriate transfers and accrual errors. Those misstated totals varied from $4.5 million to $200,000 in three different funds during the course of three years. The audit report also noted that Knudsen’s office struggled with the same issues during the last audit period two years ago, and again four years ago.
The total amount of errors across all accounts was $21.9 million in accounting and transfer errors during the course of three years. The net result was an understated amount of cash in the general fund of $12.9 million during the course of that time, while cash in the state special revenue fund and the agency fund was overstated by $6.9 million and $1.3 million respectively.
While the Department of Justice agreed with the substance of the findings and vowed to improve internal controls, a Dec. 1 letter signed by Knudsen disputed the conclusions.
“We disagree that we did not have or do not have well-trained staff with strong institutional knowledge,” Knudsen wrote.
At a hearing before the Legislative Audit Committee, Chris Darragh, the lead auditor from the Legislative Audit Division, noted that the concerns about the financial audit came with an “umbrella” recommendation. Darragh told lawmakers that the problems with the financial audits all seemed to stem from the same two problems — inexperience of the staff and lack of properly written procedures.
“We’d suggest having a job map of what the responsibilities are,” Darragh said, as well as implementing more training.

Laura Kelly in a dispute about what state official had authority to initiate or intervene in court cases on the state's behalf. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The extraordinary power struggle between Republican Attorney General Kris Kobach and Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly about control of Kansas’ participation in lawsuits landed Friday in the lap of a short-handed Kansas Supreme Court.
The drama began in September, when Kobach sued Kelly over her refusal to disclose personal information to the U.S. government on 700,000 Kansas recipients of emergency food aid. Kobach’s case was tossed by a district court judge. In October, however, Kelly sued Kobach to reinforce her belief Kansas governors had authority to play a role in determining what lawsuits the state’s chief executive was attached to in court.
Kobach asserted he held near-exclusive control of the state’s interaction with the courts. Kelly took a contrary position, arguing the Kansas Constitution and state statute granted her a voice in those legal issues.
“The attorney general has a pretty good-sized sandbox. The governor has a sandbox too, but it’s not as big. He’s not content with just playing in his sandbox. He wants to play in her sandbox as well,” said Stephen McAllister, who argued before the Supreme Court on behalf of the governor.
McAllister, who is a former U.S. attorney for Kansas, urged the Supreme Court to issue a decision that directed the attorney general to stop interfering with the governor’s participation in litigation entwined in her official duties.
Kobach, who personally argued the case before the Supreme Court, said justices should recognize the Kansas Constitution, state law and court precedent made clear the state’s attorney general was in charge of representing the state’s interests.
“That’s what I was elected to do,” Kobach said. “We are maintaining that the governor has not been elected by the people to be our representative in court. She is the supreme executive, so she is in charge of all the executive departments under the governor, but she is not the state’s legal representative.”
Kobach said argument put forth by McAllister in defense of Kelly didn’t capture the reality of how a state government approached litigation.
“It’s like angels dancing on the head of a pin,” Kobach said. “They are trying to say, ‘Oh, but there’s a difference between representing the interests of my agency and representing the state of Kansas.’ Ninety-nine percent of the time, there is no difference.”
The Supreme Court agreed in November to expedite consideration of questions raised by Kelly v. Kobach. That opened the door to a resolution that avoided waiting for lower state courts to slog through the controversy.
Oral arguments in the case Friday were conducted with six justices rather than the normal seven, as retiring Justice Marla Luckert recused herself and wasn’t replaced temporarily. Chief Justice Eric Rosen, newly sworn in to that position, didn’t reveal when the state’s highest court would issue a decision.
In advance of oral arguments at the Judicial Center in Topeka, written briefs were filed by attorneys with Kobach and Kelly. Three other GOP statewide officeholders submitted their own brief to the justices, as did the Legislative Coordinating Council, which is dominated by House and Senate Republicans.
Justin Whitten, chief counsel for Kelly, said in a brief submitted to the Supreme Court that Kansas governors possessed authority within state law and constitutional authority to serve as the “supreme executive” of Kansas. Those duties, Whitten said, included determining the interests of Kansas agencies under her jurisdiction as governor. The attorney general lacked power to block a governor from participating in litigation that he or she believed had merit, Whitten said.
He said Kobach undermined his claim as the rightful arbitrator of the state’s role in lawsuits after repeatedly refusing Kelly’s request to bring or join cases in court.
“The governor’s limited goals in initiating this litigation are clear and simple. She is seeking this court’s confirmation of the powers the Kansas Constitution explicitly granted to her,” Whitten’s brief said.
In that document, Kelly said the attorney general misread state law “by conflating his legal duties with the governor and the Legislature’s power to determine the interests of the state.” It was folly for Kobach to claim it was important for the state to speak with one voice in appellate and federal courts, the governor’s lawyers said, because federal law recognized states could speak with more than one voice in federal court.
Kansas solicitor general Anthony Powell, in collaboration with Kobach, argued in a rebuttal brief that longstanding Kansas law “tethered to the Kansas Constitution, vest the attorney general with sole authority to represent the state in federal court.” In no way, Powell said, did executive power possessed by a Kansas governor allow Kelly to control or supplant Kobach.
Powell argued the attorney general’s position didn’t violate the Constitution, because that document established the attorney general as a “separately elected and independent officer,” whose powers were as broad as common law, except when modified by the Legislature.
“Governor Kelly’s argument reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of our system of government,” Powell said. “But, despite her arguments in this matter, Governor Kelly is not the king.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Kobach-at-supreme-court-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-16 13:57:25.467611
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-16 18:50:48+00:00,CT Mirror,"Many CT renters, homeowners spend too much on housing, report says",Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/16/ct-report-affordable-housing-partnership-strong-communities/,"The report says CT lacks enough affordable housing, with many people spending too much on rent or a mortgage and limited to living in cities.","Connecticut families are often spending too much on housing, don’t have sufficient choice in where they live and are often overcrowded into apartments, according to a housing data report released Friday.
The report from the Partnership for Strong Communities, a housing research and advocacy organization, says that although Connecticut is building more housing, particularly multifamily housing, than in past years, it would still take decades to meet the need if construction continued at the current rate. 
The report examines data on housing to paint a picture of the state of housing in 2025 across several factors including housing stability, affordability and choice.
“Connecticut needs to build more homes. We need to remove barriers that make housing feasible. We need to protect renters and homeowners from displacement,” said Chelsea Ross, executive director at the partnership.
A lack of housing — particularly housing that’s affordable to people with low incomes — has long been a problem in Connecticut, and the pandemic exacerbated those existing problems.
Half of Connecticut’s renters are paying more than a third of their income to housing costs, and about 1 in 4 rental households pay more than half their income to housing costs. The problem also exists for homeowners.
About a quarter of homeowners pay more than a third of their income to housing costs, and just over 10% pay more than half their income to housing costs. This means that Connecticut residents may struggle to pay other expenses such as electricity, health care or transportation costs.
“It’s always going to be one of the big topics constituents bring up, as long as it’s such a huge part of their budget,” said Housing Committee co-chair Rep. Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport. “It’s not at the 30% that people recommend. People have to choose between paying the rent or their electric bill or buying an adequate amount of groceries.”
People of color are disproportionately likely to be burdened by their housing costs, the report says.
The report notes that although state spending on housing has been high, particularly through bonding funds, construction isn’t keeping up with need. In 2024, developers built nearly 6,000 units of housing across the state.
But, the report says, estimates show that the state needs between 120,000 and 380,000 units of housing to meet the need. Thousands of units need to be designated affordable, according to the report. The idea is that building more housing will increase supply, reducing price increases because of heightened demand.
Connecticut residents also don’t have sufficient choice in where they live, according to the report. Most of the state’s rental housing is concentrated in urban areas while suburbs and rural areas typically have single-family housing. This means that for people who can’t afford a down payment on a home, they often have few housing options outside the cities.
It’s particularly hard for families to find housing because about 70% of all the state’s rental housing has two or fewer bedrooms, according to the report. The state also lacks “starter homes,” or smaller, cheaper homes for sale that have historically been a first real estate purchase.
The lack of housing also means that many families are overcrowded in small apartments, the report says.
“Where you can live in Connecticut is really constrained by zoning, our historical zoning policies, and it pushes up costs for everybody,” Ross said.
Experts have long tied the lack of multifamily housing to zoning practices that only allow single-family homes on the vast majority of Connecticut’s residential land.
Housing stability has also worsened for many families, according to the report. Homelessness has increased over the past few years. The report also found that about 35% of the people who called the state’s 211 system for help from November 2024 to November 2025 were looking for information about housing or shelter.
Ross said the number of affordable units needed — about 92,000 — doesn’t necessarily mean building that number of units, but that some existing units could be designated affordable. The state could also increase support for rental aid programs to help meet the need, she said.
The bottom line is that the state needs more housing, she said.
“Data is important, but what’s more important is that we do something,” she said. “A really great data report doesn’t alleviate someone’s housing instability. It doesn’t create stability for a family who needs to be in a community where their kids can access education, and they can be near their jobs.”
During the last legislative session, lawmakers passed a wide-ranging bill that addressed zoning, parking regulations and homelessness, among other topics. Gov. Ned Lamont vetoed that bill, then worked with municipal leaders to create a new bill that requires towns to create plans for how they’ll grow their housing stock.
That bill passed during a special session, and Lamont signed it into law in November.
Felipe said during the next session, which starts in February, he wants to expand on that work by focusing on housing stability for families. He wants to push a measure that would require landlords to provide a reason when they file for eviction. He also wants to find other ways to prevent homelessness, he said.
“We need to figure out how to mitigate the homelessness issue, do some prevention around it, and also make sure that renters aren’t taken out of their homes for small reasons,” Felipe said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hartford-Housing-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 13:57:25.467611

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)Virginia Senate Democrats on Friday approved a controversial constitutional amendment that would allow the General Assembly to redraw the state’s congressional districts mid-decade, advancing a long-simmering proposal they say is necessary to protect Virginia voters from partisan map changes unfolding elsewhere in the country.
The Senate voted 21-18 along party lines, just three days after lawmakers convened for the 2026 session, to pass the redistricting amendment alongside three others dealing with  reproductive health rights, voting rights and marriage equality. 
All four measures had already cleared the House earlier this week, putting them on track for a statewide referendum this spring.
Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, said Democrats brought the redistricting amendment reluctantly, but argued that developments outside Virginia left them little choice.
“What you have before you today is a constitutional amendment that none of us wanted to bring to the floor, but circumstances beyond our borders have made it necessary,” Surovell said. 
He framed the proposal as a response to “unprecedented mid-decade redistricting” in Republican-controlled states, warning that Virginia’s current system could amount to “unilateral disarmament” if left unchanged.
“We worked hard. We worked diligently to establish a fair bipartisan redistricting process,” Surovell said, referring to the 2020 constitutional amendment that created the Virginia Redistricting Commission. “But we don’t operate in a vacuum today.”
 Democrats cite temporary authority; Republicans warn of a return to gerrymandering

Under the resolution that passed Friday, the General Assembly would be granted limited authority to redraw congressional lines between Jan. 1, 2025, and Oct. 31, 2030, but only if another state conducts mid-decade redistricting for reasons other than the decennial census or a court order. 
Democrats emphasized that the authority would be temporary and narrowly tailored.
Republicans sharply disagreed, warning the amendment would unravel voter-approved protections against gerrymandering and open the door to broader map manipulation.
Sen. Mark Peake, R-Lynchburg, argued that Democrats would not stop with congressional districts. 
“You’re going to redo the House of Congress. You’re going to redo the House of Delegates, and you’re gonna redo the state Senate,” Peake said. “We all know that is what is going to happen.”
Before the final vote, Democrats rejected an amendment offered by Sen. Chris Head, R-Botetourt, that would have required any new maps to be drawn by the bipartisan Redistricting Commission rather than the legislature itself.
Head urged lawmakers to remember the overwhelming support Virginians gave the commission just a few years ago. 
“Sixty-six percent of the voters of Virginia voted in favor of the constitutional amendment,” he said, calling the current proposal a reversal of a hard-won consensus against political gerrymandering.
Surovell dismissed Head’s proposal as a procedural “poison pill,” saying even minor changes would doom the amendment. “Virginia voters will decide whether they want to give us the power to take action or not,” he said.
Next, lawmakers plan to draw new congressional maps during a special session, with Democrats pledging to release the proposed districts publicly before they go before voters. The amendment would appear on the ballot in a referendum expected in April, rather than during November’s midterm elections.
Before either step can move forward, incoming Gov. Abigail Spanberger must approve both the new maps and the decision to shift the referendum to April. A spokeswoman for Spanberger did not respond Friday to a request for comment.
 How the redistricting amendment took shape

The path to Virginia’s mid-decade redistricting amendment  began abruptly in late October, amid a rare fall special session and growing national anxiety among Democrats over congressional map changes in Republican-controlled states.
On Oct. 27 — just days before the Nov. 4 statewide elections — Democratic lawmakers signaled plans to pursue a constitutional amendment that would allow the General Assembly to redraw Virginia’s congressional districts outside the traditional post-census cycle. 
The proposal emerged during a special legislative session initially called to address budget matters but quickly became a flashpoint as Democrats framed the move as a defensive response to Republican-led redistricting efforts elsewhere in the country.
At the time, Democrats argued that Virginia’s existing constitutional framework — which limits redistricting to once every 10 years following the census — left the state vulnerable if other legislatures manipulated maps mid-decade. Republicans countered that the proposal was a transparent attempt to gain a political advantage ahead of closely contested federal elections.
Those tensions spilled onto the Senate floor the next day, as lawmakers clashed over both the timing and intent of the amendment. 
Republicans accused Democrats of exploiting a special session to fast-track a politically charged proposal with little public input, while Democrats maintained that the national landscape had changed rapidly enough to justify swift action. 
The debate underscored sharp disagreements over whether Virginia should proactively arm itself against potential federal court rulings or partisan map changes in other states.
Also on Oct. 28, House and Senate Democrats formally rolled out the language of the amendment, casting it as a counterweight to what they described as increasingly aggressive redistricting maneuvers by several Republican legislatures nationwide. 
The proposal would grant the General Assembly limited authority to redraw congressional districts mid-cycle, subject to voter approval, while preserving existing guardrails intended to prevent extreme gerrymandering.
The fight intensified the following day when the House of Delegates advanced the amendment in a last-minute push that drew fierce Republican criticism. 
GOP lawmakers argued the move violated norms around constitutional changes and accused Democrats of rushing the process to avoid scrutiny. 
Democrats, however, said urgency was warranted, citing looming federal elections and uncertainty over how redistricting battles in other states might reshape the national political map.
Despite the controversy, the amendment cleared another major hurdle on Oct. 31, when the Senate approved it in a party-line vote for the first time. 
Because constitutional amendments in Virginia must be approved in two separate legislative sessions with an intervening election, the proposal returned to the General Assembly when lawmakers convened for the 2026 regular session earlier this week.

$500,000 for the Corps’ Lower Big Sioux Watershed Comprehensive Study.
$3.9 million for upgrades to security equipment and technology at the existing jail and jail expansion for the Pennington County Sheriff’s Office.
$675,000 for technology upgrades and training for the Attorney General’s Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.
$343,000 for a project to monitor and forecast South Dakota air quality impacts from wildland fires at South Dakota State University.

Rounds said the legislation also includes “robust” funding for ongoing projects in South Dakota, and other South Dakota provisions. Among those are $418 million in total funding for infrastructure upgrades and scientific research projects at the Sanford Underground Research Facility in Lead, $17.5 million for the Mni Wiconi water project, a provision requiring a report on law enforcement staffing at Mount Rushmore National Memorial and a required briefing on timber harvest levels in the Black Hills.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-16 18:40:00+00:00,CT Mirror,The Trump administration favors natural gas. What does that mean for CT?,Jan Ellen Spiegel,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/16/the-trump-administration-favors-natural-gas-what-does-that-mean-for-ct/,In some circles natural gas is viewed as the holy grail. In others it's a climate change nightmare. And then there’s everything in between.,"Doug Burgum, the U.S. Department of Interior secretary, said the quiet part out loud. 
It was a few days before Christmas, an hour or two after he had announced that five offshore wind projects under construction — including Connecticut’s Revolution Wind — was being halted “due to national security risks identified by the Department of War in recently completed classified reports.” 
Burgum told Fox News another story: “We have a solution in New England right there, which is natural gas from Pennsylvania, which would generate power five to 10 times more than all these … five projects put together.”
Natural gas.
In some circles it’s viewed as the holy grail of power supply. In others it is one of the worst climate change nightmares imaginable. And then there’s pretty much everything in between.
The U.S. produces more natural gas than any other nation. It also exports more. The Trump administration has clearly said it wants to do more of both. That was a pillar of President Donald Trump’s day one executive order, Unleashing American Energy, which put renewables like wind and solar on notice while creating a glide path for extracting and marketing more fossil fuels.
The general public has many mistaken notions about natural gas. That it is clean. That it will lower energy prices. Even that it occurs as a liquid like oil. And for sure that it is a panacea.
The misconceptions about natural gas extend to its economics and its politics. But they start with what it actually is, beginning with its name.
What’s in a name
Natural gas was given that name more than a century ago to differentiate it from the prevalent form of gas at the time, which was manufactured from coal. That gas was known as coal gas, town gas, coke gas, manufactured gas — among other names.
Natural gas, most often found alongside oil, came out of the ground as gas — so it was called “natural.” It came into wide use after World War II.
These days, some environmental advocates want to change the name to highlight its main component — methane.
“Typically I don’t call it natural gas,” said Deborah Gordon a senior principal at the energy think tank RMI, where she leads the oil and gas solutions initiative within the Climate Intelligence Program. She is an engineer with a deep background in energy and has written specifically on the myths and realities of natural gas.  
Underground, Gordon said, natural gas is anywhere from 60% to 90% methane. After it’s processed, the natural gas delivered via pipeline to New England is closer to 90% or more methane, she said.
Gordon is among many who point out that methane is a potent greenhouse gas. And the problems start well before it is burned as a fuel. The biggest of the problems is methane leaks into the atmosphere, Gordon and others say.
In the first 20 years after it is released, methane has more than 80 times the heat-trapping capacity of carbon dioxide, CO2, which is the most abundant greenhouse gas. After that, methane turns into carbon dioxide, at which point it adds to the long-term heat trapping and greenhouse gas buildup CO2 creates — some of which can last thousands of years.
The 2025 Global Methane Tracker report released in May by the International Energy Agency, IEA, stated: “Methane is responsible for around 30% of the rise in global temperatures since the Industrial Revolution, and rapid and sustained reductions in methane emissions are key to limiting near-term global warming and improving air quality.”
“The way we often talk about it is, CO2 building up in the atmosphere tells you how much warming the planet is ultimately going to experience over generations,” said Mark Brownstein, senior vice president of energy transition at the Environmental Defense Fund, EDF. 
He previously worked for the electric and gas utility PSEG, which at one time owned the Bridgeport Harbor power plant.
“Methane in the atmosphere tells you something important about how fast the rate of increase is going to be,” he said. “Reducing methane from the oil and gas industry is the most immediate, impactful and cost-effective thing that we can do to slow the rate of climate change.”
Methane leaks when the gas is extracted, when it moves through pipelines and at many other points as it’s distributed to heat homes, pumped into power plants to generate electricity or super-cooled to convert it to liquefied natural gas for transport overseas by tanker.
Peter Raymond, a professor at the Yale School of the Environment who studies and measures global methane, said the biggest source of leaks is from waste — landfills and wastewater treatment facilities. Close behind are the natural gas leaks. Much farther behind is agricultural methane — mainly produced by ruminants, mostly cows.
“The biggest leak is in exploration,” Raymond said of natural gas leakage. “There’s considerable leaks in the distribution system that you can map and find. There’s efficiency to gain along the whole supply chain,” he said.
“Basically you don’t want it in the atmosphere at all because it has this very high potency over its short lifetime. Stopping it from leaking immediately stops that warming immediately,” said RMI’s Gordon. “CO2 builds up very slowly over time, and so stopping CO2 today, which we want to do, won’t remove all that has been built up over the last 100 years in the planet.”
Natural gas also contains standard pollutants — and those can leak, too. Gordon said they’re a mixture of everything the gas touched while it was underground, plus the volatile organic compounds methane, ethane, propane and butane. All of it can also contribute to smog.
“The whole thing is a combination of air pollution and greenhouse gas,” she said. “If the air pollution was your only issue, [gas] in fact would be a better choice than coal or oil, and it is less carbon intensive than coal or oil. So over the long term, it does have some marginal benefits relative to either one of those fuels. But when there are leaks, it does have this profound impact in the near term.” 
The extent of methane leaks from natural gas and its other sources also reflects local regulatory controls, including containment systems to minimize leaks and protocols to find and fix them. Brownstein at EDF said extraction around the Marcellus Shale — the area in the Appalachian Basin that extends through Pennsylvania into New York — has better controls than the Permian Basin, which is largely in west Texas.
He said a recent EDF report showed that emissions on the New Mexico side of the Permian Basin are half of what they are in Texas. “And why is that?” he said. “Because New Mexico has a regulatory framework in place that requires companies to manage their methane emissions, whereas in Texas, they don’t.
“The first question that I would have for anybody championing natural gas coming into Connecticut is, what has the state of Connecticut done to make sure that the methane emissions are managed well within the border?” he said. “And two, what is it that suppliers bringing gas into Connecticut should be doing to manage the methane footprint of the gas that they’re selling into the region?”
The American Gas Association, which says it represents more than 200 local energy delivery companies, claims on its website that “emissions from natural gas distribution systems have dropped 70% since 1990,” though it does not specify which emissions.
The site also lists among its commitments to “further reduce methane emissions from natural gas utility systems,” and it notes that AGA has put in place a reporting system for companies to document methane reduction actions. It also states that natural gas is “clean.”
AGA did not respond to questions about its actions or whether it supported the Trump administration delay of stricter methane emission standards.
Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, DEEP, has a pipeline safety group that monitors and manages leaks. The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority regulates the gas distribution system within the state.
But all Connecticut’s gas comes from outside its borders, and that interstate movement is overseen by federal entities. 
“We don’t have jurisdiction to regulate those activities,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said. Producers, she said, have been better about stemming leaks at the wellheads and production facilities. Lost gas is also lost money for them.
DEEP tracks methane emissions in its annual Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory, which monitors the state’s progress towards its emissions goal. “While Connecticut has reduced fugitive emissions from older gas infrastructure by replacing older cast iron gas lines with newer PVC distribution lines, fugitive emissions have risen imperceptibly since the previous year,” its most recent report, released in September, stated.
Connecticut does not include the emissions that occur in the production of gas that eventually comes into the state. “This inventory does not capture the full effect of methane leaks into the atmosphere from the natural gas distribution system because natural gas consumed in Connecticut is produced and stored out of state,” the report also stated. New York, California and Washington do include that in their inventories.
“I think what keeps us up the most [at night] is that policymakers seem to be still reaching for gas as a solution for affordability, despite how much has changed to the contrary about the affordability of gas in the last 10 years,” said Jamie Dickerson, senior director of clean energy and climate programs at Acadia Center, a regional advocacy group for clean energy and climate change solutions.
He said even though the climate concern is still there, “we still are very concerned that natural gas would actually have an upward impact on energy prices and exacerbate the current affordability dynamics in the region.”
The counter-intuitive economics of natural gas
In certain policy circles, there has been no shortage of discussion, news stories and market analysis about the economics of Trump’s push for more U.S.-produced natural gas. And they all get at a similar idea — as gas production increases, so will the price for U.S. consumers. That may sound counterintuitive.
There are good reasons for it, though.
One is that even if all the gas was destined to be used in the U.S., producers would still need to drill, produce and transport it. Who would pay for that, including new pipelines and all the other construction components? U.S. consumers.
But a lot of the gas is not destined for use here. Much of the Trump administration’s motive for boosting production is to sell it to other countries — especially European countries trying to stop using Russian gas. They’ve been willing to pay relatively high prices, which gas producers certainly like.
If U.S. buyers want some of that gas, in order to be competitive they would to have to match those European prices. Even if you strip out the costs of liquefying it and transporting it to Europe, U.S. buyers would still face higher prices for natural gas, which seems to leave them stuck between a rock and a hard place.
The most recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, EIA, shows how stark that price increase was in 2025 alone, despite an increase in gas production. Last year, the average wholesale spot price for the benchmark Henry Hub in Louisiana increased by 56% compared to 2024, when prices hit the lowest on record when adjusted for inflation. (Prices tend to be higher in winter than summer when gas is used for both electricity and heat.)
The average prices for the two hubs used by the Northeast — one in Boston and one in New York — doubled over that same period.
According to an analysis of EIA data done by the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, there were record exports of natural gas — mainly as LNG — over the course of the first nine months of the Trump administration. They went up 22%. Costs for natural gas consumers also went up 22%.
January data from EIA predicts the benchmark natural gas price will decline in the beginning of this year, before rising sharply into 2027.
Michael Oristaglio, senior research scientist and lecturer in earth and planetary sciences at Yale University, and former director of the university’s energy studies program, said that could leave the oil industry in a bind. Since oil and gas often are a two-for-one drilling proposition — with oil prices too low for companies to want to invest and oil demand declining as well — drilling for more gas could go down with the oil ship.
“That is the issue in the Permian Basin,” he said. “The Marcellus is a little different. It’s one of the only shale formations that just produces natural gas.”
Compromising the ability to build new gas infrastructure is a shortage of natural gas turbines that is predicted to last until 2030. And even if the infrastructure could get built, tariffs might raise the cost — again, something that consumers would likely have to bear.
Even so, Connecticut is not ruling out a tilt back to natural gas use, despite years-long efforts to pivot away. 
Dykes said DEEP is researching the many factors around fossil fuel use, including the critical cost-benefit analysis, as it develops its next Integrated Resource Plan, IRP, which assesses future electric needs. While she noted that the cost of electricity is highly sensitive to the delivered price of natural gas in New England, she also referenced the marching orders from her boss.
“Gov. Lamont has been speaking for more than a year now about the importance of considering all energy options as a part of an all-of-the-above approach. And he’s been very interested in understanding what the potential benefits might be of expanding gas access, particularly to help make energy costs more affordable and make the grid more reliable,” she said.
At the opposite end, Dykes has to factor in how to meet the state’s decarbonization goals and mandates. She pointed to additional gas as a potential counter-balance to renewable power that may not be available 100% of the time. But she admitted that trying to weigh the many sudden moves by the Trump administration — such as the second shutdown and now court-ordered restart of construction on Revolution Wind — can make that process daunting.
“I think the only thing that anyone really can say with certainty is that the list of uncertainties continues to grow,” Dykes said. “Unfortunately, that doesn’t relieve us of the necessity of making some decisions and making some investments, with the best information we can, to help ensure that we have a reliable and affordable grid that can meet the long term policy goals that the legislature has set here in Connecticut.”
Brad Campbell, president of the New England-based Conservation Law Foundation, CLF, and a former Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator, said that the conventional wisdom for many years was that if you wanted to lower electricity prices in New England, all you had to do was build more infrastructure to get more gas in. But he said that’s a misconception.
“Building more pipes isn’t going to reduce prices for New Englanders when the price of the commodity going into the pipe is going higher and higher,” he said. “Running another pipe — the gas industry expects that to be borne on the backs of ratepayers.”
Brownstein of EDF also pointed out that gas, unlike renewables such as wind and solar, comes with the ongoing cost of having to pay for every unit that’s consumed.
“When you say that a new gas pipeline will be run into New England, or you say that New England will build a whole bunch of new gas plants, ultimately you will pay for that every time you turn on your lights, and every time you turn on your stove,” he said. “It’s very nice for the Trump administration to say that you need all this and you should want it. It’s another thing to say to a homeowner in Connecticut, ‘Guess what you’re going to have to pay for.”’
Brownstein said in recent travels to Europe, he heard worries about the continent becoming too dependent on U.S. gas — namely, if energy prices begin to rise in the U.S., would the Trump administration restrict exports in order to keep energy prices in the U.S. low?
“They see that simply replacing their dependence on Russian gas for dependence on American gas may not be a smart bet either, particularly as the United States has become a less predictable ally,” Brownstein said.
Add to that the current dispute the U.S has with new E.U. regulations for monitoring and tightening methane emissions on oil and gas coming into the E.U. beginning next year. The U.S. has asked for an exemption. It’s unclear how that could play out — but it could push prices higher.
And there are also questions about how to move forward with existing gas infrastructure. Spend the money to repair it when needed? Replace it if necessary? Even expand it?
“We’re not doing the right cost-benefit analysis to determine where the public should be putting its money,” said Noah Berman, senior policy advocate and utility innovation program manager at Acadia Center.
That’s where politics comes in.
The politics of natural gas in the age of Trump
Connecticut has had its own love-hate political relationship with gas over the last 15 or so years. In 2013, in the state’s first Comprehensive Energy Strategy — developed by the then-new Department of Energy and Environmental Protection — converting to natural gas was a go-to strategy.
Its key goal was to take advantage of cheap prices from the fracking boom to convert more than 300,000 homes and businesses from oil to natural gas heat. Gas was touted as cleaner and a bridge fuel from oil to renewables. 
Climate advocates were incensed, predicting it would entrench gas for a generation or more. There were also concerns about the lack of pipeline capacity and the cost of building out infrastructure to distribute gas to homes.
While the policy stayed in place for years, the goals were never reached and it quietly vanished as the focus turned to electrification through heat pumps, rooftop solar and storage.
But much of the region did not look kindly on more gas lines or plants. A study done in Massachusetts 10 years ago found that more gas lines weren’t needed until at least 2030. While some gas generation was built, and oil-burning plants converted to gas, local opposition contributed to stopping others — including a plant planned in Killingly.

New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Maine are, to varying degrees, exploring what are referred to as “future of gas” policies — ways to wean states off using natural gas, from very gentle pushes towards heat pumps to strict rules barring new gas hookups for homes and businesses.
But with Trump’s pro-fossil fuel and anti-renewables policies in place, New York has delayed implementation of its gas bans that would have started on Jan. 1. The state’s governor, Kathy Hochul, is now considering allowing a gas pipeline to be built after years of opposing it. The concession is said to have been the price for restarting Empire Wind construction after the first time Trump ordered it stopped earlier in 2025, though Hochul claims that is not the case. (The project was one of those recently stopped again.)
Massachusetts has recently made moves towards backing off some its climate goals — though a longstanding ruling, which keeps utilities from charging customers for new gas lines, remains in place.
Connecticut has been on the sidelines for much of this — especially cutting back on gas use. Legislation that has promoted future of gas evaluations has failed more than once in recent years, and EIA data shows that gas consumption in the state is rising.
“Connecticut is an outlier on gas consumption rates among the rest of the region,” said Acadia’s Dickerson. “If you isolate just Connecticut, the rest of New England is actually flat or declining gas consumption over the past five to 10 years.” 
Acadia supports consideration of non-pipeline solutions — like promoting heat pumps, solar or geothermal energy — to avoid recommitting to natural gas when existing infrastructure has reached the end of its useful life or has safety issues.
The Trump administration has been steadily endeavoring to peel away safeguards against greenhouse gases as well as standard emissions of all sorts. It’s keeping coal plants open past their planned shutdowns. And the administration is close to rolling back more restrictive Biden administration standards for mercury and carbon emissions. 
For methane specifically, it has delayed until 2034 stricter emission standards also put in place by the Biden administration. A number of groups, including EDF, are challenging that in court.
“There’s no question that the Trump administration is working to put a thumb on the scale of oil and gas,” said Brownstein of EDF. “Doubling down on natural gas exacerbates a methane problem that they’re taking no action to solve, and, in fact, undoing work that the previous administration did that actually would have made a material difference.”
An open question is whether the Trump administration — through its energy emergency executive order, or any other energy actions including quid pro quos to restart offshore wind and other projects — will be able to force natural gas into or through a state that doesn’t want it.
On Jan. 13, the EPA announced a proposed rule to limit states’ ability under the Clean Water Act to deny federal permits for infrastructure like gas pipelines if the state feels they pose a hazard to water bodies. It follows a proposed rule issued in November that would remove federal pollution protections from many inland waters and most wetlands.
“They are absolutely trying to override state authority. And their theory is that anything states do that burdens the oil and gas industry — anything that burdens big oil and big gas — should be overridden because it interferes with the President’s authority in declaring the energy emergency,” Campbell at CLF said. 
“I think at the end of the day, the political pressure on governors to deliver on an affordability agenda is going to drive the same changes in policy, the same changes in the utility model and utility practice that we need to decarbonize the grid,” Campbell said. “But the one thing that seems certain is that deepening our addiction to natural gas for heat and electricity is going to only going to take us in a less affordable direction.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AIM-image1-Cromwell-CT.jpg,,,2026-01-16 14:57:19.150798

(Photo by Thad Allton for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A bipartisan Kansas bill that aims to implement a bell-to-bell cellphone ban beginning next school year would override local rules and establish one of the nation’s most restrictive policies. 
The bill already has garnered a two-thirds supermajority of support from the Kansas Senate, as well as the support of Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. 
Supporters of the bill say students would be mentally and physically safer, while opponents argue it’s an overreach of power that asks too much of students and schools. 
More than 20 people testified on Senate Bill 302 on Thursday before the Senate Education Committee, including Timothy Graham from the Kansas National Education Association, which represents 22,000 educators. 
“Our members are all over the place on this issue,” Graham said. “Understandably so.”
 
‘Problematic outcomes’
Ngoc Vuong, a school board member for Wichita Public Schools and a community psychology PhD candidate, told the committee he researches the academic effects of cellphones in schools.
“While multiple factors are responsible for causing and exacerbating the ongoing youth mental health, literacy, and numeracy crises, the evidence increasingly points to the advent and proliferation of a screen-based childhood, the immense power and influence of Big Tech companies over our society, culture, and education system, and the unhealthy relationships many children and adolescents have with smartphones and social media as central drivers of these problematic outcomes,” Vuong said. 
In his written testimony, Vuong linked cellphone use to poor academic performance, attention, executive functioning, sleep, and physical and mental health. 
Gretchen Shanahan, a parent from Overland Park, referenced a National Association of School Resource Officers statement supporting a bell-to-bell cellphone ban. 
“Access to phones during the school day reduces student safety in normal and especially emergency situations,” Shanahan said. “During an emergency such as a school shooting, students must be completely focused on lifesaving instructions. Phones can easily distract students from hearing, understanding and reacting appropriately — even when students use the phones to communicate with their parents.”
Kevin Cronister, a retired detective with the Internet Crimes against Children Task Force, said that based on his experience, a cellphone ban would mitigate the risk of predators contacting students. Cronister said predators often target students during the school day, when they are away from their parents, and may ask students to introduce them to classmates. 
Several proponents criticized the Kansas State Board of Education’s directive allowing each school district to craft its own policies around cellphone use, urging lawmakers to instead adopt a statewide ban.
 
District level decision
Cathy Hopkins and Beryl New, legislative liaisons for the Kansas State Board of Education, testified neutrally on the bill. They pointed to the Blue Ribbon Task Force on Screen Time in 2024 that led to the state board’s directive, and said districts that developed policies in collaboration with their community have seen the strongest results. 
Topeka Democrat Ann Mah, a former state representative, served on the board of education when it sent out the directive allowing for local control. 
“It should be clear that these discussions belong at (the district) level,” Mah said. “It should also be clear the Legislature has no role here. When you have school districts that range from fewer than one hundred students to more than 45,000 students, there is no way the Legislature can create a one-size-fits-all solution. 
“Besides that, I’m fairly certain that the 2,000 or so locally elected school board members are in a better position than you to make that call. What message are you sending your local board members? They likely already have a policy, but you think you know better? Seriously?” 
Kailey Howell, a senior at Spring Hill High School, said her cellphone has never distracted her from schoolwork. 
“While I understand that this is not the case for all students, I am confused as to why I am now having to bear the weight of consequences that were never meant for me,” Howell said. “Education has always been what students choose to make of it. Students with positive attitudes and a desire to learn will do so. Students who purposely avoid learning at every cost will not learn. Removing phones doesn’t change a student’s attitude. It only gives them another avenue to find another distraction.”
In his neutral testimony, Graham from the Kansas National Education Association — who also mentioned that teachers are divided on this bill — brought up the lack of funding. 
Multiple proponents acknowledged that schools would need dedicated storage for cellphones. Along with the storage, Graham said, districts would need to train staff, enforce compliance, and report to the state — all without additional funding. 
 
The big picture 
Eighteen states — including Washington, D.C., and the Virgin Islands — have banned cellphones and other wireless communication devices for the entire instructional day, the bell-to-bell policy. 
Neighboring Nebraska, Missouri and Oklahoma are part of that mix, and pushed similar bills forward last year. 
Preliminary data shows that strict school cellphone bans, like what’s being proposed in Kansas, have led to more more focused students, according to a University of Pennsylvania survey of 20,000 teachers. 
Florida was the first state to entirely ban cellphones in schools in 2023. A National Bureau of Economic Research paper found there was an adjustment period in 2024, the first year the ban took effect, with an increase in suspensions in the short-term — especially among Black students. By the second year, suspensions had dissipated, test scores increased, and there were fewer unexcused absences.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4F5A1655-1024x585.jpg,,,2026-01-16 13:57:25.467611
,DC,2026-01-16 18:30:40+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,One year of Donald Trump: Alarms sound over relentless expansion of presidential powers,"Ashley Murray, Jacob Fischler",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/one-year-donald-trump-alarms-sound-over-relentless-expansion-presidential-powers,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump promised during his bid for another White House term that he would be a dictator only on “day one.”Before a town hall audience in Iowa in December 2023, Fox News host Sean Hannity asked Trump, “Under no circumstances, you are promising America tonight, you would never abuse power as retribution against anybody?”“Except for day one,” Trump responded, seconds later adding, “I want to close the border and I want to drill, drill, drill.”But a year since his inauguration, Trump has acted on some of his most extreme campaign hyperbole, and then some. A limited history of Trump’s expansion of presidential powers includes:The unilateral capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Máduro and deadly U.S. military strikes on suspected drug-running boats off that nation’s coast, as well as a threat to acquire Greenland.The targeting of Democratic-led cities with federal immigration agents — most recently Minneapolis — and National Guard troops.The threat to cut congressionally approved funding from institutions, including universities, that do not align with the administration’s ideology.The prosecution of political opponents and attacks on the free press.Those actions and others, coupled with a cooperative GOP Congress, have created an unprecedented shift away from the United States’ democratic tradition and founding principles that establish a system of checks and balances, States Newsroom was told in extensive interviews over recent months.Many congressional Democrats — and nearly half of Americans, in a recent poll — believe Trump has gone too far in his expansion of presidential power. Historians, political scientists and legal experts have sounded the alarm, with some saying the United States has reached authoritarianism, even as Trump has shown no signs of slowing down. Experts interviewed agreed that the United States finds itself in a “troubled moment,” as William Howell, dean of the School of Government and Policy at Johns Hopkins University, put it. “We've never seen a presidency that represents such an enduring threat to the health and well-being of our democracy as we do today,” said Howell, who recently co-authored the book “Trajectory of Power: The Rise of the Strongman Presidency.”Experts wary Ilya Somin, professor of law at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School and constitutional studies expert with the libertarian Cato Institute, said “I don't know that it is likely that we're going to slide into authoritarianism, but the very fact that the issue has to be raised is itself already bad.”“My hope, and to some extent my expectation, is that a combination of legal and political action will stop these abuses, or at least curb them, and to some extent, it has already. But, you know, how well the system withstands it remains to be seen,” Somin told States Newsroom.Others painted a more dire picture by pointing to the lack of such checks from the other branches of government.

Retired Army Col. David Graham, a senior fellow at the Georgetown Law Center’s Center on National Security, said Congress’ inability to block Trump’s military action in Venezuela shows that the president is operating with “unbridled” power.“This unbridled presidential authority represents what I consider to be a clear and present danger to the national security of the United States and to the global security of the international community,” Graham said.The Cato Institute’s Patrick Eddington offered: “It is absolutely noteworthy the speed and systematic nature (with) which Trump has been successful in literally gutting and reshaping to his will the domestic instruments of coercive power.” “I speak here about the departments of Justice and Homeland Security, in particular, but also successful in reshaping the military, the military leadership and the entire institution, to make it essentially as subservient as possible,” Eddington, the think tank’s senior fellow in homeland security and civil liberties, and former senior policy adviser for Rep. Rush Holt, D-N.J., told States Newsroom.Doubts growing among AmericansPollsters also find voters are increasingly wary of Trump’s governing style.A recent Quinnipiac University poll found 70% believed the president needed authorization from Congress to go to war. The same day the poll was released, Jan. 14, the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate rejected a measure to require Trump to obtain permission before further operations in Venezuela.Bright Line Watch, a quarterly survey of the health of American democracy, has shown a decline in both expert and public opinion of how U.S. democracy has fared since Trump’s inauguration. The poll, conducted since 2017, surveys roughly 700 political science faculty at U.S. universities and 2,750 members of the general public.A Pew Research Center survey of 3,455 adults released in late September found 7 in 10 Americans believe Trump is trying to exert more presidential power than previous administrations. And overall, 49% of those surveyed said that Trump’s use of power compared to presidents past is bad for the country — though responses notably split along partisan lines.In response to an interview request for this story, White House spokesperson Liz Huston provided a one-sentence on-the-record written statement.“President Trump is making America greater than ever before for all Americans,” she wrote.Throughout its first year, the Trump White House has trumpeted its many policy victories, including conducting mass deportations, raising money through tariffs, extending tax cuts, cutting some federal spending and exerting influence over elite universities.Deploying the National Guard Throughout 2025, until the Supreme Court disallowed the practice days before New Year’s, Trump sent National Guard troops to a handful of cities led by elected Democrats. Depending on the city — Los Angeles; Washington, D.C.; Chicago; Portland, Oregon; Memphis, Tennessee; and New Orleans  —  he rationalized the deployments as either to control crime or protect immigration operations and federal property.His critics, though, say those were pretexts meant to get Americans used to seeing military forces in U.S. cities, potentially to be deployed during the next federal elections.“It's really designed to lay the groundwork to normalize a militarization, essentially, of American civic life, as a prelude to using federal troops and National Guard troops, probably specifically for so-called election integrity operations,” Eddington said.  The deployments themselves, especially in California, Illinois and Oregon, where Democratic governors who usually control the state national guards vociferously objected to federal troops patrolling their cities, seemed to violate a founding U.S. principle against the military acting as a police force. The Supreme Court eventually ruled that the Chicago deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a 19th-century law forbidding military forces from civilian law enforcement.

Trump’s use of military forces domestically is out of step with precedent, at least of the last 50 years, Elizabeth Goitein, senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, said.“The last nine presidents, not counting Trump I, we saw exactly two deployments to quell civil unrest or enforce the law,” she said. “Nine presidencies. Under President Trump, it's happened five times in the last four months. So this is not normal,"" said Goitein, who previously worked as counsel to former Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis.Oregon Democratic U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley told States Newsroom the deployments marked one of the criteria of authoritarianism.“In order to anchor a strong-man state, you have to have the ability to put troops in the street,” he said.All night on the Senate floor Congressional Democrats, and in a few cases Republicans, have also protested Trump’s reach.Days after nationwide “No Kings"" day protests filled the streets on Oct. 18, Merkley led fellow Senate Democrats in an all-nighter on the Senate floor, speaking against what they described as Trump’s slide into authoritarianism. In mid-December, Merkley introduced a resolution “denouncing the horrors of authoritarianism.”Merkley has emerged as perhaps the leading Democrat focusing on Trump’s authoritarian tendencies. He’s made several closed-door presentations to his colleagues on the subject that includes urging them to look beyond the daily drumbeat of Trump news, he said.

“It’s one issue after another in this flood-the-zone undertaking, and it's easy to see the issue of the day and miss the big picture,” Merkley said in a Jan. 8 interview with States Newsroom. “And the big picture is a systematic implementation of an authoritarian strategy to create a strong-man state.” Merkley has branded Trump’s actions as authoritarianism, but said that is actually “weaker” language to describe it.“The stronger language is fascism,” he said. Speaking the day after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis, Merkley said the agency’s mode of operating under Trump, as well as the deportation of hundreds to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador, were fascism in action.“And when you see people with their faces covered, with no identifier of what military unit or police unit they belong to, it just says like, ‘Police.’ That's fascism. Grabbing people off the street without due process, preventing them from talking to a lawyer, shipping them overseas. That's fascism,” he said.Congressional Republicans who control the Senate and the House have paved a smooth path for Trump’s agenda.Despite a notable rebuke of Trump, in which a handful of Senate Republicans joined Democrats to advance legislation to curtail Trump’s unilateral military actions in Venezuela, the chamber eventually opted not to rein in the executive.Republican Sens. Todd Young of Indiana, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska split with their party in the Jan. 8 procedural vote to act as a check on the administration’s use of military forces — as did Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the measure’s co-sponsor with Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia. Trump swiftly responded on Truth Social that the five “should never be elected to office again.”The pressure campaign worked. In a followup vote less than a week later, Young and Hawley flipped and voted to block the measure.Five days prior to the procedural vote, U.S. special forces apprehended Maduro and his wife from their bedroom in the Venezuela capital of Caracas.Extra-judicial Caribbean killingsIn the months leading up to the operation, the Trump administration amassed roughly 15,000 troops and personnel, according to a figure cited in a U.S. Southern Command press article, and nearly a dozen warships in the region, including the largest U.S. aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, according to numerous media reports on the buildup. U.S. Southern Command declined to confirm specifics on “force posture.” Since September, U.S. warplanes have targeted numerous small boats off the coast of the South American country, killing more than 115 alleged “narco-terrorists” by the end of 2025, according to the U.S. Southern Command.By using the military, instead of police, to kill, instead of capture, suspected drug traffickers, Trump was subverting the rule of law, critics across the political spectrum said.Rep. Adam Smith, ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, said, “Basically what the president has decided is that we are now going to have the death penalty for drug traffickers.” “But further, not only are we gonna have the death penalty, but Trump is going to be judge, jury and executioner. … That, again, is a massive expansion of presidential power,” Smith, a Washington state Democrat, told C-SPAN’s Washington Journal Dec. 19.Graham, a former staff judge advocate for U.S. Southern Command, said the alleged drug-running boats should have been treated as suspected criminals, not as enemy combatants akin to terrorist groups like al-Qaida. The alleged drug organizations involved did not constitute an “armed attack on the U.S. government,” he said.But the Trump administration wrongly expanded the definition of enemy combatants to include alleged drug organizations, rather than as alleged criminals, to circumvent laws governing police powers, he said. “If there exists no non-international armed conflict, and thus no applicable law of armed conflict, no unlawful combatants, no lawful targets, the U.S. personnel conducting these strikes. …  are simply engaged in extrajudicial killings,” he said.

Perhaps most troubling, Graham said, Trump told New York Times reporters in a Jan. 7 interview he did not “need” international law, and that the only restraint on his use of the U.S. military was his “own morality.”Venezuela is not the only country on Trump’s radar. The president told reporters as recently as Jan. 11 that the U.S. is going to take over Greenland “one way or the other.” Trump first mentioned buying Greenland, a territory of NATO ally Denmark, during his first term. Now, in his second, the president has not ruled out the idea of taking the massive Arctic island by force. Quashing dissent Soon after Trump took the oath of office for the second time, he trained his focus on any dissent. Universities, media outlets and law firms were quickly in his crosshairs. The president demanded that in return for federal funding, access to government buildings and contracts, the institutions adhere to principles in line with the administration’s vision for America. The administration froze billions of federal research and grant dollars for Harvard University unless it changed its admissions and hiring policies, among other demands. The university won a First Amendment lawsuit against the administration in Massachusetts federal district court Sept. 3. Much of the funding was restored, according to Harvard Magazine, but the Trump administration appealed the decision in mid-December, again putting the nearly $2.2 billion in jeopardy. Other higher education institutions settled with Trump’s White House, including Columbia, which agreed to pay $200 million over three years to get its federal funding reinstated. “Universities that Trump considers to be liberal in their views are being punished. Journalists and media companies that don't toe the line (and) that are critical of Trump are being punished, directly or indirectly,” Goitein said. “Everywhere you look, you are seeing the targeting of people and institutions based on perceptions that they are politically opposed to the president,” Goitein said.In late September, Trump signed a memo directing law enforcement to prepare a national strategy to investigate “domestic terrorists” who are animated by “anti-fascism” as well as “anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity.”Attacks on the free pressThe president has also homed in on news and entertainment media that don’t align with his vision.The Associated Press and the White House remain tangled up in court over press access after the wire service refused to use “Gulf of America” in its reports without noting that Trump had ordered a renaming of the Gulf of Mexico. The AP, a leader in editorial style, issued the same guidance for other news outlets. In response, the administration curtailed the AP’s access to press events in the Oval Office and on Air Force One. The Pentagon has also placed stipulations on press access. In October, dozens of reporters walked out of the building after Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth gave journalists an ultimatum: either sign a pledge to only publish approved material or lose their press badges.Trump also requested Congress yank previously appropriated funds for public broadcasting stations around the country, including affiliates of National Public Radio and Public Broadcasting Service, which the administration said “fueled partisanship and left-wing propaganda.” House and Senate lawmakers voted mostly along party lines to nix the funding in July.

Trump has also been exerting influence over network television, both news and entertainment operations.In September, Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr threatened to revoke Disney-owned ABC’s affiliate licenses unless they pulled “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” from the air after the late-night host made comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.Disney and ABC adhered to Carr’s demand but reinstated Kimmel a week later following public outcry.ABC News settled with the then president-elect in December 2024 for a $15 million charitable contribution to his future presidential library, and $1 million for legal fees. Trump had sued the network for defamation following a misstatement by “This Week” host George Stephanopoulos regarding a civil suit finding.In July, CBS’ parent company, Paramount, paid Trump $16 million after he sued over an edit in a “60 Minutes” interview with then-Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.Trump and his enemies Trump’s latest target among his political foes is Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The president has publicly pummeled Powell with threats to fire him if he did not rapidly lower interest rates.Powell learned Jan. 9 upon receiving a federal grand jury summons that the Department of Justice is probing whether he lied to Congress in June about renovation costs to the agency’s District of Columbia headquarters. Trump’s investigation of the Fed chair drew swift criticism as an overreach into independent monetary policy decisions meant to stabilize the economy.

Numerous former Fed chairs and White House economic officials who served under both parties issued a statement calling the investigation  “an unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine that independence.”The investigation revelation even roused Senate Republicans to question Trump’s actions. Retiring Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said in a statement he will oppose Trump’s forthcoming nominations to the Federal Reserve board of governors, including the Fed chair vacancy when Powell’s term expires.“If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,” wrote Tillis, who sits on the Senate Banking Committee. Murkowski chalked up the investigation as “nothing more than an attempt at coercion.” Even Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told numerous reporters on Capitol Hill Jan. 12 that the allegations against Powell “better be real and they better be serious.”Trump had already exerted his influence over the central bank when he fired Board Governor Lisa Cook, appointed to the panel by President Joe Biden in 2023.

Trump hit setbacks in lower federal courts after Cook sued and retained her position. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on Jan. 21 on the question of the president’s power to fire independent agency appointees without cause. The justices heard a similar argument Dec. 8 over Trump’s firing of Federal Trade Commission appointee Rebecca Slaughter. The president has so far hit roadblocks in his other attempts to prosecute political opponents, including former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.A federal judge in Virginia dismissed Trump’s cases against Comey and James after finding U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi illegally appointed former special assistant and personal lawyer to the president, Lindsey Halligan, as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.

Halligan secured a two-count indictment against the former FBI chief for allegedly lying to Congress over a leak to the press about the bureau’s investigation into whether Russia played a role in Trump’s first presidential campaign. Comey pleaded not guilty.The indictment followed the departure of Halligan’s predecessor, Erik Seibert, the acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who declined to seek charges against Comey.Halligan also secured an indictment against James, alleging bank fraud and that she lied to a financial institution to receive better loan terms. James also pleaded not guilty.James successfully prosecuted a massive fraud case in 2024 against Trump, his family and the Trump Organization, for falsely inflating asset values.In one particularly high-profile post on his own social media platform, Trump directly appealed to Bondi to prosecute Comey and James.“Pam: I have reviewed over 30 statements and posts saying that, essentially, ‘same old story as last time, all talk, no action. Nothing is being done. What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.He continued further down in the post: “We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”Eddington described Trump’s actions as a “revenge tour” and said the president is “utilizing the coercive power of government, and in this particular case the Department of Justice, to go after his political enemies.”Then, the administration on Jan. 5  attempted to downgrade the military retirement rank and pay of Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat and retired Navy captain. Trump and Hegseth singled out Kelly after he and five fellow Democratic lawmakers, all veterans, published a video encouraging U.S. troops to refuse “illegal orders.”

In a barrage of Truth Social posts on the morning of Nov. 20, Trump wrote, “Their words cannot be allowed to stand. SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!! LOCK THEM UP??? President DJT” “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!,” he added a couple of hours later.The president reposted several messages from Truth Social users, including one with the handle @P78 who wrote, “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!” The lawmakers published the video as the U.S. was nearly three months into its campaign of striking small boats off the coast of Venezuela.Alien Enemies ActThe president has also reached back as far as the late 18th century to invoke laws meant for extraordinary circumstances.In March, Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to bolster his mass deportation campaign and deport more than 100 Venezuelans, without due process, to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador. The wartime law, which had only been invoked during the War of 1812 and both world wars, gives the president power to deport people from nations with which the U.S. is at war.

Even when a federal judge issued an emergency order that the flights carrying men deported under the law turn back to the U.S., the Trump administration did not comply. As of Jan. 13, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said it was unlikely the men could be retrieved due to the chaotic situation in Venezuela, which the Trump administration caused.The Venezuelan nationals, ages 14 and up, many of whom the administration accused without evidence of being gang members, were incarcerated for months before being released to their home country in a prisoner exchange.   A federal appeals court has blocked Trump, for now, from using the law to quickly expel Venezuelan nationals. A full hearing is pending.Trump renamingTrump is also facing headwinds from Democrats and advocates for affixing his name to federal buildings and his face to this year’s national parks annual pass.Senate Democrats Chris Van Hollen and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland joined independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont Jan. 13 to introduce what they’re calling the “SERVE Act,” short for “Stop Executive Renaming for Vanity and Ego Act.”

The lawmakers unveiled the bill less than a month after Trump announced his name would now appear on the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. Trump was elected chair of the cultural center after he installed new board members early in his second term.Sanders said in a statement that Trump aimed “to create the myth of the ‘Great Leader’ by naming public buildings after himself — something that dictators have done throughout history.”Rep. Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio, sued Trump in federal court on Dec. 22, alleging only Congress has the power to rename federal buildings.A public lands group has also challenged Trump in federal court, alleging he broke the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act when he replaced a national contest-winning photo of Glacier National Park with his image next to George Washington on the U.S. residents’ annual National Parks and Federal Recreation Lands Pass.‘The best job ever’Nearly a year after he took office, Trump again sat down with Hannity. In the Jan. 8 interview — the same day the administration sent more federal agents to Minneapolis in the face of intense protests and a day after the president said his own morality was the only restraint on his power — the Fox News host asked whether Republicans will win the upcoming midterm elections.“I think we've done a great job,” Trump said. “Maybe the best job ever in the first year.”Timeline graphic by Ashley Murray.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2026-01-16 13:57:25.467611

Ron DeSantis is requesting the Legislature provide hundreds of millions of dollars for the Florida Department of Corrections (FDC) in his proposed fiscal year 2026-2027 budget, but a Democratic state senator says that is woefully inadequate.
Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith of Orlando made the remarks following a budget presentation by FDC Secretary Ricky Dixon before the Senate Appropriations Committee on Criminal and Civil Justice on Wednesday.
Specifically, FDC is asking for $374 million to raise base pay for corrections officers, probation officers, inspectors, and non-uniformed staff from $22 an hour to $28 an hour.
Dixon told the committee that it’s “the most significant pay increase I’ve seen in three decades in this business,” adding that it will “make a major impact” on retaining corrections officers, who often leave the department to work for other law enforcement agencies that pay higher wages.
But, citing a 2023 report that found that the state’s prison agency path was “unsustainable,” Smith acknowledged that Dixon can’t ask for more than what the governor is asking for, but that his agency needs more funding to survive.
“He needs much more … and he’s not able to ask for that,” he said, referencing the detailed blueprint by global consulting firm KPMG, which estimated the department needs between $6 billion and nearly $12 billion to repair buildings and construct new facilities, with hundreds of millions more needed to pay for staffing.
“That doesn’t  even include the cost of new dorms that are existing prison locations. It doesn’t include new construction for facilities to accommodate the growing prison population,” Smith said. 
“We have to remember as we are looking at this large request, rightfully so, that there are young 20-something year-olds with no experience who are watching over hundreds of men by themselves. Because they have no staff. We have a whole fleet of vehicles at the Department of Corrections that is way below the DMS [Department of Management Services] standard. They’re breaking down full of incarcerated people. That’s dangerous.”
Dixon told the same committee in November that Florida houses more than 89,000 inmates, a population that has increased by more than 10,000 since 2021. He added that the number is expected to rise by another 4,100 over the next three years.
“If we’re going to be a ‘tough on a crime state’, we have to understand what that means dollars and cents on the back end of being tough on crime, with an aging and overflowing prison population,” Smith added.
The governor’s proposed budget for the corrections system includes:

$56.7 million for an additional 500 full-time security positions.
$56 million to fund construction of new housing units.
$48 million for ongoing modernization of FDC’s data systems.
$18.8 million for critical security equipment such as body scanners and body-worn cameras.
$5.5 million to upgrade and replace aging state vehicles.
$3.5 million for expanding FDC’s intelligence capabilities using modern technologies that help officers and staff identify and eliminate contraband from the state prison system.
$3.3 million to replace radios, radio towers, and associated systems at multiple institutions.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0-1-1024x570.png,,,2026-01-16 13:57:25.467611

Jackson Mayor John Horhn and the city’s Inter-Faith Task Force featuring religious leaders across faiths and denominations led a crowd of Jacksonians through prayers and a call to action – an event that had been planned before the fire but took on new urgency after it.

The event, held at Thalia Mara Hall, allotted time for prayers and special remarks for Beth Israel. Jackson’s only Jewish congregation was a primary focus of the service after the early Saturday fire that destroyed part of the synagogue, which is the state’s largest.
Stephen Spencer Pittman, 19, of Madison is facing federal and state arson charges in the attack.
“I wish I could say that this moment of our coming together in mourning and solidarity and hope and in friendship was unique, but unfortunately we have been here before,” Shemper said. 
“For us Jews, we have been here for literally thousands of years – between dark and light, hate and love, between being feared and accepted, between going and coming, between birth and destruction and rebuilding,” he said. “And we will always rebuild.”
Shemper told the story of a similar attack on Beth Israel in 1967, when the Klu Klux Klan bombed the building in retaliation for Rabbi Perry Nussbaum’s civil rights activism. In the aftermath, many non-Jewish people in the local community supported the synagogue and denounced the attack.

“Beth Israel is not brick and mortar,” said Russell, who spoke after Shemper. “Beth Israel is the people who gather, who pray, who learn, who argue, who care for one another. Wherever we gather, that is Beth Israel.”
Russell said the attack was meant to make members of Beth Israel feel like they didn’t belong, but the community has embraced them with love and solidarity.
“We are rebuilding trust. We are rebuilding connection. We are rebuilding with the knowledge that we do not do this work by ourselves,” he said.
To close, the rabbi offered a blessing to the crowd, who gave him a standing ovation.

After their remarks, the crowd huddled into small groups to pray for Beth Israel. 
The mayor and Derrick Johnson, national president and CEO of the NAACP, spoke before Shemper and Russell.
“It’s an indictment on our country, on our community, that there wasn’t a way for someone to stand in the gap, to turn him around, to make him inspired not to make that journey,” Horhn said of Pittman.
Horhn led the crowd in a prayer for a better Jackson, for healing and for the entire Jewish community.
“Help us build a Jackson that’s safer, that’s more respectful and more hopeful for everyone,” he said.

Johnson, who lives in Jackson, compared the fire at Beth Israel to similar hate-based attacks in El Paso, Texas; Louisville, Kentucky; and Pittsburgh. He said the common denominator between the attackers is that they were radicalized on social media platforms. 
Johnson also said people need to push back against the current political climate. He said this climate was “germinating directly from the White House,” to which one unknown attendee called out, “It’s not coming from the White House.” Johnson did not acknowledge the response.
“Under no circumstance should we allow political platforms to divide us for an agenda that has nothing to do with who we are and who we should be,” Johnson said. “We must learn from our history, not repeat it.”
The night began with worship songs and ended more prayers for the mayor, city and state officials, and for the state and city itself. At the end, faith groups were invited to adopt an area around their place of worship to do projects that would improve the community. The first workday will be Monday on Martin Luther King Jr Day.
If convicted on the state charge, Pittman’s sentence could be enhanced under a state law that punishes “offenses committed for discriminatory reasons.” The federal government did not immediately not charge him with a hate crime.

A federal affidavit alleges Pittman broke into Beth Israel early Saturday morning, doused the lobby with gasoline and set the building ablaze. 
The fire destroyed the library and administrative offices, two Torahs and the synagogue’s Tree of Life. Several other Torahs were damaged. One Torah that survived the Holocaust and was in a glass case remained unharmed. Beth Israel is accepting donations for rebuilding efforts.
Pittman was arrested at a hospital in Jackson, where he was being treated for burn injuries.
Authorities say Pittman confessed after being arrested that he targeted the synagogue for its “Jewish ties,” and called Beth Israel a “synagogue of Satan.”
Pittman was released from the hospital Wednesday and is in federal custody ahead of his preliminary hearing in federal court next Tuesday.
The attack drew national and international attention. State, local and national officials have condemned the arson and antisemitism. U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, has called on the FBI to investigate the incident as a hate crime.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-16 18:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"As temperatures dip, Bridgeport shelters struggle to meet the need",Reginald David,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/16/bridgeport-ct-shelters-cold-weather/,"While more CT households seek shelter each year, available shelter beds have declined, according to Opening Doors Fairfield County.","On cold winter nights in Bridgeport, dozens of unhoused residents line up outside the Alpha Community Services YMCA warming center because there are no shelter beds available elsewhere in the city.
When Connecticut activates a cold weather emergency, Bridgeport’s shelter system stretches beyond its limits. The warming center, Bridgeport’s only overnight option during extreme cold, opens at 7 p.m. and has space for just 30 cots. It operates on a first-come, first-served basis. On many nights, far more people arrive than the center is funded or designed to accommodate.
“We refuse to turn anyone away,” said Nicholas Hoffman, executive director of Alpha Community Services YMCA. “But we’re funded for 30 spaces, and many nights we’re serving 60 or 70 people. We collaborate with Prospect House a block up the road, which offers us some beds.” 
This winter, Connecticut has activated its cold weather protocol multiple times as temperatures dropped to dangerous levels across the state. While the protocol is intended to expand emergency shelter access, service providers in Bridgeport say the system is already operating beyond capacity.
Homelessness is increasing, while shelter space is shrinking.

According to Opening Doors Fairfield County, which coordinates homelessness response efforts across the region, the number of households seeking assistance increased by 24% from 2023 to 2024, while available shelter beds declined by 23%. From 2024 to 2025, the number of households needing help rose another 29%, while shelter capacity dropped by an additional 10%.
Homelessness across the state rose by 9.5% from 2024 to 2025, according to the state’s annual point-in-time count.
As a result, warming centers like the YMCA are functioning as full-scale shelters, despite not being designed, staffed, or funded to do so. Hoffman said the building, a former day care center owned by the city and repurposed years ago, was never designed to function as a full-scale shelter.
“We’re seeing the vulnerabilities of the infrastructure,” he said. “We need to feed people, provide hygiene, basic human needs. But we also have to ask bigger questions about how the system is structured and whether this is the right space or if services need to be spread across multiple providers.”
Gov. Ned Lamont last month assigned an additional $6.9 million for grants to organizations fighting homelessness and to maintain vouchers for supportive housing that were previously federally funded. The funds were part of the state’s $500 million emergency fund created to address the impact of cuts at the federal level. Connecticut has reported significant budget surpluses for years and has a healthy budget reserve.
But advocates say funding decisions at the state level aren’t helping enough.
Homelessness providers across the state are calling for an annual $5 million allocation for cold weather resources through proposed legislation. The funding would allow for more emergency beds, faster responses during extreme cold, and long-term planning, without requiring providers to reapply for emergency funds each winter, they say.
“It’s cold every winter in New England,” Hoffman said. “This shouldn’t be a yearly emergency.”
For people staying inside the shelters, the conditions can still be difficult.
Shirley Hurd, 68, said she became homeless after losing the house she was renting, which she believes was sold without proper notice.
“They sold the house I was in,” Hurd said. “I was paying. I had receipts. Then I had to go.”
Hurd said navigating shelter life is physically and emotionally exhausting, especially during the winter months. Overcrowding, limited bathroom access, and heightened tensions make survival more difficult.

“You’ve got almost 60 people and only two bathrooms,” she said. “People talk to you any kind of way. Some nights, there aren’t even beds and you just end up back outside.”
Frieda Brooks, 74, has lived in Bridgeport her entire life. Disabled and unhoused for more than three years, Brooks said she lost her housing after her son was shot and killed.
“I’ve lost a lot,” Brooks said. “But I’m still hanging in there.”
Without a phone, Brooks relies on word of mouth to learn about available resources. She said churches and community organizations have helped her survive, but accessing information remains difficult.
“There is help out there,” she said. “You just have to find it the best way you can.”
Epi Carrera, who has been unhoused since December 2023, said the YMCA warming center has been critical to his survival during cold weather. Still, he said overcrowding and stress can create challenges.
“When it gets really cold, people’s temperaments change,” Carrera said. “You’ve got different people, different cultures, different problems all in one space.”
Carrera said the solution requires more than emergency shelter.
“We need more beds,” he said. “We need more services, vocational help, and people who understand what folks here are dealing with.”
Inside the Alpha Community Services YMCA, staff and volunteers provide food, showers, hygiene supplies, and overnight supervision. By morning, they are exhausted, Hoffman said, but the focus remains on keeping people safe.
“This building was never meant to serve this many people overnight,” Hoffman said. “It’s not sustainable.”

The facility, owned by the city, operates as a community space and navigation hub for most of the year. During winter months, it becomes a warming center, a model Hoffman said exposes serious infrastructure limitations, particularly as the number of families and seniors experiencing homelessness continues to rise.
“Our space is funded and designed for single adults,” Hoffman said. “Families and seniors need more room and more support. What we’re doing right now is a temporary fix.”
The warming center is scheduled to close March 31. Service providers warn that without changes to funding, infrastructure and coordination, next winter could be even more dangerous.
For people like Hurd, Brooks, and Carrera, the stakes are high.
“This is about survival,” Hurd said. “People shouldn’t have to freeze just because there’s no space.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026_0112_SR_HomelessnessBridgeport_037-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 14:57:19.150798
,DC,2026-01-16 17:53:46+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Trump threatens tariffs on Greenland, countries that oppose US takeover",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-threatens-tariffs-greenland-countries-oppose-us-takeover,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump threatened Friday to place tariffs on Greenland and any country that opposes his efforts to take over the Arctic island, as members of Congress from both political parties were in Europe to assure allied nations that lawmakers won’t go along with his plans. “I may do that for Greenland too. I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland because we need Greenland for national security,” Trump said. “So I may do that.”Trump has been increasingly focused on acquiring Greenland during his second term in the Oval Office and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier this month that “utilizing the U.S. Military is always an option at the Commander in Chief’s disposal.”Lawmakers not on boardRepublicans and Democrats in Congress have been skeptical or outright opposed to Trump’s aspirations for Greenland, a territory of Denmark, which is a NATO ally.Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Maine independent Sen. Angus King, co-chairs of the Senate Arctic Caucus, met with officials from Denmark this week to try to reassure the country’s leaders. King wrote in a statement after the meeting that “the Denmark and Greenland coalition reiterated to us that they are fully prepared to cooperate with the United States in any way to expand our national security presence in Greenland – an agreement which goes back 75 years.” “It was a very productive meeting and I'm hopeful that the administration will finally realize that taking Greenland over by a military force is almost unthinkable — to attack essentially a NATO ally,” King added. “That would be the greatest gift to (Russian President) Vladimir Putin that this country could possibly bestow.”Murkowski wrote that the “United States, Denmark and Greenland should be able to count on each other as partners in diplomacy and national security.”“Respect for the sovereignty of the people of Greenland should be non-negotiable, which is why I was grateful for the opportunity to engage in direct dialogue with Foreign Ministers from Denmark and Greenland,” Murkowski wrote. “Meetings like the one held today are integral to building stronger relationships with our allies that will continue to endure amid a shifting geopolitical landscape.”House speaker derides ‘media narrative’U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said during a press conference this week that he hasn’t heard any plans for military action in Greenland at any briefings he’s attended and that he believes “this is a media narrative that's been created.”Johnson said he doesn’t “anticipate any boots on the ground anywhere anytime soon,” though he added the United States does have national security and critical mineral interests in Greenland. “Greenland is of strategic importance, its geography and everything else. So look, again, you have to wait for that to play out. I'm going to leave it to the administration to articulate it how they will,” Johnson said. “But I think what the president is articulating is something that everybody objectively has to acknowledge, that Greenland has strategic significance to us and also to other countries around the world, so we need to play that very seriously.”A bipartisan congressional delegation was in Denmark on Friday to communicate to leaders of that country and Greenland that they don’t support Trump’s efforts. Lawmakers on the trip include Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, Murkowski, New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, as well as Pennsylvania Democratic Rep. Madeleine Dean, Maryland Democratic Rep. Steny Hoyer, California Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs, Delaware Democratic Rep. Sarah McBride and New York Democratic Rep.

[…]","Event Recap
On January 13, 2026, CommonWealth Beacon hosted a Zoom webinar with Executive Editor Michael Jonas to  discuss the submission and publication process for opinion pieces at Commonwealth Beacon.
The session included a presentation of best practices for submission, including a list of do’s and don’ts, and concluded with a call for questions from the audience.


Takeaways+
Do:

Have a clear point that can be captured in a single sentence and boiled down even further into a headline
Focus on something that is “in play” in Massachusetts
Write clearly so that a smart, but not expert, reader can follow your argument
State your main point early
Back that argument with facts, which can include a reasonable number of links

Don’t:

Submit a piece that is so broad it lacks a clear focus
Have as a focus a point that virtually no one would take issue with
Write for insiders who know the issue well (avoid “alphabet soup”)
Wait until the last paragraph to get to your point




Resources+





Q&A+


What word count range are you looking for?
Generally, 700–900 words (up to 1,000 is still in-range). That’s typically enough space to make a strong argument without losing readers. Online publishing allows flexibility, but writers should use as much space as needed—no more—and avoid filler or “throat clearing” before getting to the point.


Should writers stick to the word count when submitting, or write long and expect edits?
Stick to the word count unless you have a compelling reason it truly needs more. Submissions that are much longer create significant editing burden and can delay feedback. Aim for under 1,000 words unless you can make a strong case for exceeding that.


How long should contributors expect to wait for a response after submitting (even just an acknowledgment)?
With current staffing and submission volume, if we’re interested, you’ll typically hear back within about two weeks. Time-sensitive pieces may move faster, but contributors should assume their piece should still feel timely one to two weeks after submission.


Who is your readership, and do you run op-eds about pending legislation?
The audience is best described as Massachusetts’s “engaged citizenry”—not just Beacon Hill insiders, but people who pay more than average attention to state policy and civic life and are looking for substantive, “meaty” pieces. On pending bills: you can write about legislation, but the piece shouldn’t just be a call to pass Bill X. Use the bill as part of a broader argument about the issue and debate—avoid “contact your lawmaker and urge a yes vote” style advocacy language.


What scope of topics works best—Boston, Massachusetts, New England, federal?
Massachusetts-wide is the sweet spot (it’s in the name Commonwealth Beacon). Boston topics can run, but we’re mindful of the “Boston bubble” and aim for statewide relevance and balance. National/international issues are generally not the focus unless they’re clearly connected to Massachusetts.


Are you open to embedded media (photos, video, graphs)? And how many links are too many?
Yes—media can be welcome if it meaningfully strengthens understanding. For photos, contributors must ensure proper rights/permission to publish. For links: they can help readers dig deeper, but don’t overwhelm—there’s no magic number, but ~5–6 key links is a good target.


What topics do you wish more people would submit op-eds about?
We’d welcome more pieces on the economy, business, employment, higher education (we get many K–12-focused submissions, fewer higher ed pieces), local/municipal government issues—as long as the topic isn’t so town-specific it belongs only in a local outlet; it should be generalizable to broader statewide or multi-community challenges.


Is there a preference for solo vs. jointly written op-eds?
No preference—co-authored pieces are fine within reason. Three to four authors is pushing the outer edge; five to six starts to feel unwieldy and more like a coalition statement than a genuinely co-written op-ed.


Do you only want pieces about what’s “in play,” or can writers argue for issues being ignored (or bring history/analysis)?
“In play” should be taken broadly—a strong argument about an issue being ignored can be a great fit, including calling out Beacon Hill for neglecting it. We also welcome historical perspective and pieces that don’t fit the classic op-ed mold—more like an essay—as long as it’s compelling, well-written, and engaging (even if it’s not tied to a specific Massachusetts policy action).


Do you have a policy limiting how often a writer or organization can be published?
There is no formal rule, but we’re mindful of not running the same voices or organizations too frequently.


Do you prefer working with PR representatives or directly with authors?
We’re more inclined toward pieces that come directly from authors. PR-submitted pieces can raise questions about messaging or “spin,” though we do publish pieces that come through communications shops. Bottom line: you don’t need a PR intermediary—reach out directly.


If someone works with MassINC’s policy team, are there special guidelines for submitting to CommonWealth Beacon?
CommonWealth Beacon operates independently within MassINC (parallel tracks: journalism vs. research/policy). Having a relationship with the policy side doesn’t disqualify a submission, but it also doesn’t provide priority. Pieces that reference MassINC research are treated similarly to pieces drawing on other policy organizations’ work.


How are podcast topics decided, and do you accept pitches?
Yes, we welcome pitches for topics and guests. Don’t use the op-ed portal—email Michael Jonas, Laura Colarusso, or Jennifer Smith.


How long do op-eds stay in a prominent spot on the website? Do they get removed?
On the homepage, the opinion section has three slots; pieces get pushed down as new ones publish. We aim for one new opinion piece each weekday, so a piece typically stays featured for about three days. After that, it remains accessible via the opinion landing page and search—it doesn’t disappear and remains available long-term.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/1.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-16 12:57:44.537908

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota lawmakers on the the House Education Committee on Friday unanimously deferred action on a bill to more effectively remove violent children from public school classrooms on a temporary basis.
The bill was introduced at the request of the South Dakota Education Department and supported by Gov. Larry Rhoden’s administration. It would authorize school districts to require students with “aggressive or violent behaviors” that disrupt school or endanger other students or employees to continue their public school education in an “alternative setting.”
The legislation would help plug a “leaking” workforce pipeline, Education Secretary Joe Graves said, since teachers are increasingly leaving the profession due to violent student behaviors. South Dakota is still recovering from a yearslong teacher shortage.
Lawmakers determined the bill was too brief and too vague. The legislation doesn’t lay out the process for the removal, time limitations or parental involvement. Nor does it define “alternative setting” or “aggressive or violent behaviors,” said Rep. Mike Stevens, R-Yankton.
“I’m not sure 37 words is going to plug this hole,” Stevens said.
In 2015, 7.5% of South Dakota teachers left the profession entirely, according to department data. In 2025, 17.3% left the profession. Graves said behavioral issues are the second leading cause of teachers leaving the profession, behind teacher pay.
Graves said children have thrown objects through windows, destroyed classrooms and smashed computers — increasingly at the elementary school level, and sometimes injuring educators.

Graves shared a message from an elementary school teacher, who said if they were a new teacher “no way I’d stick it out if this is what I’d deal with until retirement.”
Several lawmakers raised concerns about how removing a student from a classroom for violent behavior would impede their education. Graves told lawmakers it would harm the student’s education.
“It’s better for the other 20 kids who don’t have to face that violence and disruption,” Graves said.
Rob Monson, executive director for the School Administrators of South Dakota, told lawmakers that the bill could cause legal challenges and more costs for school districts. Other lobbyists raised concerns about responsibilities not outlined in the bill and capacity issues at existing alternative education options, such as Children’s Home Society in Rapid City and Sioux Falls.
Monson added that schools already use in-school suspension to separate children within a building. Superintendents can suspend students for up to 90 days. School boards can choose to expel students, which involves a hearing and investigation.
Graves said expulsion is a “little-used disciplinary tool.”
Lawmakers asked Graves to meet with them, education lobbyists and other stakeholders over the next few weeks to amend the bill and reintroduce it to the committee.

(Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer)More than 100 Twin Cities clergy gathered at the skyway entrance to Target’s downtown Minneapolis headquarters Thursday to sing, pray and demand the retailer take a stronger stand against federal law enforcement activity in the metro and prevent agents from using its properties as staging grounds.
“We are shopping elsewhere, we shall not be moved,” the group chanted. ISAIAH, a nonprofit coalition of Minnesota faith and community groups, organized the demonstration. 
By evening, the group said outgoing Target CEO Brian Cornell had agreed to meet with them Monday. But “there is no cause for celebration until Target leadership has leveraged their power and done their part to meaningfully protect their workers, their customers, and the communities in the state they call home,” they added.
Target management has kept a low profile since the Trump administration ramped up immigration enforcement in the Twin Cities last month. The company remained silent after video surfaced on Jan. 8 of federal agents arresting two Target employees at a Richfield store as a raucous crowd gathered around. Democratic-Farmer-Labor Rep. Michael Howard, who represents Richfield, later told media that the pair were U.S. citizens.
Last weekend, several carloads of federal agents — including U.S. Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino — descended on a Target in St. Paul. Bystander video showed agents standing guard outside the men’s room as shoppers heckled them. 
Target representatives did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.
Other big Minnesota employers have largely followed Target’s lead, remaining quiet even after ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Nicole Good on a south Minneapolis street last week. 
In addition to Target, the Reformer reached out to UnitedHealth Group, 3M, General Mills, Medtronic, U.S. Bank and the Minnesota Business Partnership, an advocacy group for the state’s largest private employers. None of the companies responded by press time. A representative for the Minnesota Business Partnership responded but did not provide any comment on the record.
“Corporate and political leaders are seriously underestimating how mad Minnesotans are about the ongoing federal attacks,” Jake Schwitzer, executive director of the Twin Cities-based progressive policy research firm Northstar Policy Action, said in an email.
The corporate heavies are confronting a nearly impossible choice: President Donald Trump is known to use his considerable power over tariffs and tax and regulatory enforcement to reward companies in his good graces and punish those that oppose him. Target, 3M and other big companies are especially vulnerable to tariff rates; UnitedHealth is facing federal scrutiny in a number of highly regulated business units. 
The companies are also still bruised from the aftermath of the police murder of George Floyd, when many of them made significant commitments around diversity, equity and inclusion. The political winds shifted quickly, however, with right-wing media and consumers targeting companies that took up social justice goals. When Target reversed course on DEI after Trump’s election in 2024, the company faced another backlash and boycott, this time from progressives. 
The federal law enforcement surge has already significantly disrupted Minnesota’s economy, Schwitzer said in an analysis posted Wednesday.  Immigrants account for about 1 in 12 Minnesota residents but roughly 1in 9 of its workers, meaning actions that compromise their safety and freedom of movement disproportionately affect business activity in the state, he said. 
Roughly 4 in 5 businesses along key commercial corridors in Minneapolis and St. Paul have closed during the past week as employees lay low, and revenue is down nearly across the board, the Minnesota Star Tribune reported Tuesday. Immigration raids at suburban construction sites have disrupted homebuilding activity in the region, according to Twin Cities Business.

“Right now, many businesses in Minnesota are seeing fewer customers and struggling to staff shifts,” Richard Trent, executive director of Main Street Action, said in a statement Wednesday. “Owners need their employees to feel safe coming to work and their customers to feel comfortable walking through the door.”
Trent’s group represents about 1,500 small businesses in Minnesota.
In an interview, Howard said he has been engaging privately with Target leadership for weeks. Though he declined to characterize the substance of those conversations, he said Target and other large employers should follow the lead of smaller businesses and “take a stronger stance” to assert their rights as private enterprises.
“There are things that some businesses have done … that we think all businesses should do as a matter of practice,” Howard said.
He said those measures could include putting up signs saying immigration agents aren’t welcome without judicial warrants; more clearly communicating with customers about how they engage with federal authorities; and implementing “training protocols to protect their workers and staff.”
Howard acknowledged that big, well-known companies may be reluctant to speak out against an administration that has shown itself to be “vindictive” toward critics, corporate or otherwise. Trump’s Justice Department has investigated, indicted or attempted to indict individual critics like former FBI director James Comey, New York attorney general Letitia James and Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, among many others.
“It’s corporate culture, in general, that where businesses can stay silent and out of the public frame, that is the default,” Howard said.
But he added that taking a stronger stance may be the right move from a business standpoint. The ISAIAH demonstration suggested a backlash could be building against brands seen as timid or out of step with a public that recent polls show is broadly opposed to heavy-handed federal policing.
Schwitzer warned that things could get much worse if Trump succeeds in his efforts to cut off federal funding to “sanctuary” cities and states — including Minnesota — next month.
“This isn’t going to blow over, and silence from corporate and political leaders won’t protect their constituents, employees, or customers,” he said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/P1011964-scaled-e1583971737225-1024x738.jpg,,,2026-01-16 13:57:25.467611

A judge in Milwaukee brought a 13-year quest for justice by a grieving father to a close on Thursday, accepting a plea deal for two men charged criminally for their role in the killing of his teenaged son.
Robert W. Beringer and Jesse R. Cole pleaded guilty to felony murder under a deferred prosecution agreement that allows them to avoid jail time yet publicly stand accountable for their actions leading to the 2012 death of Corey Stingley. The men helped restrain the 16-year-old inside a convenience store after an attempted shoplifting incident involving $12 worth of alcohol.
“What happened to Corey Stingley should have never happened. His death was unnecessary, brutal and devastating,” Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne told the judge in a letter filed with the court.
Both of Stingley’s parents spoke directly to the judge in an hourlong hearing in a courtroom filled with family members, community activists, spiritual leaders and some of the teen’s former classmates.
“Corey was my baby. A mother is not supposed to bury her child,” Alicia Stingley told the judge. She spoke of the grace of forgiveness, and after the hearing she hugged Beringer. The Stingleys’ surviving son, Cameron, shook both men’s hands.
The agreement requires Cole and Beringer to make a one-time $500 donation each to a charitable organization of the Stingley family’s choosing in honor of Corey. After six months, if the two men comply with the terms and do not commit any crimes, the prosecution will dismiss the case, according to documents filed with the court.
ProPublica, in a 2023 story, reexamined the incident, the legal presumptions, the background of the men and Stingley’s father’s relentless legal campaign to bring the men into court. The three men previously had defended their actions as justified and necessary to deal with an emergency as they held Stingley while waiting for police to arrive.
Ozanne, who was appointed in 2022 to review the case, recommended the agreement after the two men and the Stingley family engaged in an extensive restorative justice process, in which they sat face to face, under the supervision of a retired judge, and shared their thoughts and feelings. Ozanne said in the letter that the process “appears to have been healing for all involved.”
From the bench, Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Laura Crivello said she found the agreement to be fair and just and commended the work of all the parties to come to a resolution.
“Maybe this is the spark that makes other people see similarities in each other and not differences,” she said. “Maybe this is the spark that makes them think about restorative justice and how do we come together. And maybe this is part of the spark that decreases the violence in our community and leads us to finding the paths to have those circles to sit down and have the dialogue and to have that conversation. So maybe there’s some good that comes out of it.”
Craig Stingley, Corey’s father, said during the hearing that his 13-year struggle “has turned into triumph.”
Earlier, the Stingley family filed a statement with the court affirming its support for the agreement and the restorative justice process.
“We sought not vengeance, but acknowledgement — of Corey’s life, his humanity, and the depth of our loss,” it states. “We believe this agreement honors Corey’s memory and offers a model of how people can come together, even after profound harm, to seek understanding and healing.”
The family remembered Stingley as a “vibrant, loving son, brother, and friend” and found that the restorative dialogues brought “truth, understanding, and a measure of healing that the traditional court process could not.”
Jonathan LaVoy, Cole’s attorney, told reporters after the hearing: “This has been a long 13 years. He’s been under investigation with multiple reviews over that time. I think everyone is just so happy that this day has come, that there’s been some finality to this whole situation.”

In a joint written statement provided to the court, Beringer and Cole said they came to recognize “the profound ripple effects” of the incident and their connection to Stingley’s death. They expressed sorrow that Stingley’s “time on this earth ended far too soon.”
The proceeding followed years of work by Craig Stingley to force the justice system to view his son as a crime victim whose life was unlawfully cut short by Beringer, Cole and another store patron, Mario Laumann, who died in 2022.
Prosecutors at the time declined to charge anyone, saying the men did not intend to kill Corey Stingley when they tackled him and pinned him to the floor of VJ’s Food Mart, in West Allis, Wisconsin. They were detaining him for police after the youth attempted to steal bottles of Smirnoff Ice. In surveillance video, Laumann can be seen holding Stingley in a chokehold while the other two men aided in restraining him. A witness told police Laumann was “squeezing the hell” out of the teenager.
The Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s Office found that Stingley died of a brain injury due to asphyxiation after a “violent struggle with multiple individuals.” It ruled the death a homicide.
Under Wisconsin law, the charge of felony murder is brought in cases in which someone dies during the commission of another alleged crime — in this case false imprisonment.

Ozanne wrote to the court that his analysis found that “there is no doubt Cole, Beringer and Laumann caused Corey Stingley’s death.”
All three men, he wrote, restrained Stingley “intentionally and without his consent” and without legal authority to “arrest” him. “Simply put, Corey, a teenager, was tackled and restrained to the ground by three grown men because they suspected him of shoplifting,” Ozanne wrote. “They killed him while piled on top of his body awaiting the police.”
But he noted that there is no evidence that Beringer or Cole knew that Stingley was in medical distress during the incident. He described their hold on him as “rudimentary detention techniques.”
It was Laumann, Ozanne concluded, who “strangled Corey Stingley to death.” Ozanne wrote that surveillance video shows Laumann’s arm for several minutes across Stingley’s neck “as he fades out of consciousness.”
If Laumann were still alive, Ozanne said in court, prosecutors likely would have been seeking a lengthy prison term for him.
Stingley died the same year as Trayvon Martin, a Black Florida teen shot to death by a neighborhood volunteer watchman, who was acquitted in 2013. Martin’s case drew national attention and led to the formation of the Black Lives Matter movement. But Stingley’s death after being restrained by three white men did not garner widespread notice outside Wisconsin.
Over the years, Craig Stingley unsuccessfully advocated for the men to face charges. Two prosecutors reviewed the case, but nothing came of it.
He then discovered an obscure “John Doe” statute, dating back to Wisconsin’s territorial days, that allows a private citizen to ask a judge to consider whether a crime has been committed and, if so, by whom when a district attorney can’t or won’t do so.
Stingley filed such a petition in late 2020. That led to the appointment of Ozanne as a special prosecutor to review the matter yet again. In 2024, Ozanne informed the Stingley family that his office had found evidence of a crime but that a guilty verdict was not assured for the remaining two men.
That set in motion an effort to achieve healing and accountability through a restorative justice process. Restorative justice programs bring together survivors and offenders for conversations, led by trained facilitators, to work toward understanding and healing and how best to make amends. Last year, Stingley and members of his family met on separate occasions with both Cole and Beringer through the Andrew Center for Restorative Justice, part of the law school at Milwaukee’s Marquette University.
The discussions led to the deferred prosecution agreement.
In an interview, Anthony Neff, a longtime friend of Craig Stingley’s, recalled seeing Corey Stingley in a hospital bed, attached to tubes and a ventilator in his final days. Corey Stingley had been a running back on his high school football team. Everyone in the program showed up for the funeral, Neff said.
“Coaches. The ball boys. The cheerleaders. I mean, they’re all standing in solidarity with Craig and the family,” he said.
In the years since, he and other golfing buddies of Craig Stingley’s have provided emotional support in his quest. Neff called it “a lesson in civics, a master lesson in civics.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/craig-stingley-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-16 12:57:44.537908

“Measles is a serious and contagious virus that has seen a resurgence in recent years,” Dr. Steven Stack, the cabinet secretary, said in a statement. “We continue to urge families to take these risks seriously and to protect themselves and their communities by getting the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.”
Public health officials said they are investigating any additional exposures related to this case and contacting people who they believe were exposed. 
The state recently reported another potential exposure around Dec. 28-30 in Grant County. 
“People who may have been exposed should monitor themselves for symptoms for 21 days after potential exposure,” Dr. John Langefeld, Kentucky Department for Public Health Commissioner, said in a statement. “Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and rash. If you believe that you have been exposed to measles and you have symptoms, please call your health care provider.”

According to the cabinet, there is a low risk to the general public at this time. Still, Stack and Langefeld said anyone can talk to their health care provider about the MMR vaccine, which is 97% effective against measles. 
Measles spreads through the air from coughs or sneezes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
One infected person can infect 9 in 10 unprotected people around them, the CDC says. 
“Health officials encourage good health habits to prevent transmission of measles and other contagious illnesses, such as washing hands often with soap and warm water, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying at home from work or school when sick,” the cabinet said.

Ford International Airport |  Gerald R. Ford International Airport Authority photoThe Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy on Friday announced $9 million in grants would be awarded to 19 municipal airports across the state to help monitor and remediate PFAS contamination caused by firefighting foam. 
According to EGLE, the funding will be used for a wide range of purposes, including PFAS testing and monitoring, potential source control and cleanup strategies for groundwater and stormwater and to clean firefighting equipment and replace firefighter turn-out gear.
The department received a total of 21 applications requesting $14.8 million in funding, following a request for proposals from the Michigan PFAS Response Team, which was established in 2017. The team collects seven state agencies to ensure coordination in how they respond to PFAS contamination.
PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of chemicals used to produce things like food packaging, non-stick cookware and stain-resistant clothing. The chemicals break down very slowly over time and accumulate in the tissues of living things.
These chemicals have been linked to several negative health effects, including increased cholesterol levels, reduced immune system responses, interference with the body’s natural hormones, increased risks of multiple types of cancer and reproductive harms including decreased fertility and high blood pressure in pregnant women.
The airports receiving funding include:

Battle Creek Executive Airport – $300,000

(Getty Images)The number of Floridians relying on a federal health care exchange established under the Affordable Care Act has dropped by more than 261,000 people after Republicans in Congress let expire the enhanced premium tax credits that help hold down coverage costs.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said 4,474,300 Florida residents used the federal health exchange known as healthcare.gov to procure health insurance for 2026, down from 2025 enrollment of 4,735,415.

Florida Health Justice Project policy director Melanie Williams called the 5.5% drop in coverage a “warning sign for families and for Florida’s economy.”
“When people lose health insurance, they delay care, face higher medical debt, and are more likely to end up in emergency rooms, which drives up costs for everyone. This enrollment dip doesn’t just affect individual households, it puts pressure on hospitals, local governments, and the state budget, and it underscores how fragile access to affordable coverage remains for working families across Florida,” she said in a statement to the Florida Phoenix.
“Florida Health Justice Project will continue to fight for vulnerable Floridians who deserve access to meaningful health coverage,“ Williams added.
Nationwide, nearly 22.8 million consumers had signed up for 2026 coverage, also a dip from 2025 enrollment of 23.6 million. 
Far fewer people buy Obamacare coverage as insurance premiums spike

Despite the decline in 2026 enrollment, Florida still leads the nation in ACA, or Obamacare, enrollment, ahead of Texas, where 4,113,465 people enrolled.
Open enrollment for 2026 health insurance coverage began Nov. 1 and ended Dec. 15 for policies that took effect Jan. 1, 2026. Enrollment continued through Jan. 15 for Feb. 1, 2026 coverage.

(Photo courtesy of Morningside University)Morningside University and St. Luke’s College – UnityPoint Health are starting off 2026 with efforts to begin melding the campuses together, having announced in summer 2025 that St. Luke’s will eventually become a Morningside location.
Jackie Barber, dean of the Nylen School of Nursing and Health Sciences at Morningside, and Morningside Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs Chris Spicer said the first step in the acquisition process is complete, with hopes for full combination after the year ends.
The private colleges, both located in Sioux City, have worked together for a long time and have offered “joint two-plus-two programs” since 2019, Spicer said. This acquisition is an opportunity to expand that partnership and others, he said.
Barber said the idea for the acquisition was born from trying to think of ways to utilize both institutions’ strengths, as well as strengths from UnityPoint Health, to bolster “academic delivery of these health care programs” and the health care workforce pipeline.
“I think the biggest prompt is this vision of really needing to have a strong health care workforce in the Siouxland regional area,” Barber said.

While the initial announcement of the impending acquisition came out in July, Spicer said both institutions had been talking about it since the previous fall. The first phase of the process went “fairly smoothly,” he said, with the Higher Learning Commission approving the acquisition in November after September visits to both campuses.
The effective date of the acquisition was Dec. 31 and with that date’s passage, Spicer said Morningside has submitted an official notification of change in ownership to the U.S. Department of Education. Now in the second phase, university officials are waiting for that approval and other regulatory steps while beginning the transition process for St. Luke’s students, faculty and staff.
One point of uncertainty for St. Luke’s students at the onset of this process was how their transcripts and such will be impacted and how quickly, Spicer said. For now, St. Luke’s students will continue to receive St. Luke’s transcripts and degrees, but when that changes is contingent upon when further approvals come in this year.
“While we wait for this, U.S. Department of Education approval, St. Luke’s College remains a separate college with its own separate degree authorization, separate accreditation, federal student financial aid participation,” Spicer said. “And so it remains a separate entity.”
However, efforts to bring St. Luke’s faculty into the Morningside fold and meld together other services have already begun. Barber said Morningside faculty have been “very excited to receive the St. Luke’s faculty,” and the university is “very fortunate” to retain faculty from programs they’re bringing to Morningside.
Those programs include associate degrees in nursing, radiologic technology and respiratory care and a bachelor’s degree completion program in health sciences. Barber said these will complement the nursing and health sciences programs already offered at Morningside, and she hopes to eventually relaunch a medical laboratory science program that was discontinued due to a faculty retirement.
While the current focus is on ensuring the continued delivery of quality higher education at both institutions, Barber said an overarching goal of the combination is to strengthen pathways for upskilling and continuing education needed for the health care workforce.
“I’m confident that as we grow in the future, the hope is we will continue to add, strategically, programs that help support the health science disciplines and careers,” Barber said.
Morningside will not keep St. Luke’s RN-BSN degree completion program, as it has its own version of the same degree, and current students will finish out the program while new students will enroll in Morningside’s degree.
As for staff roles, Barber said the Morningside team “really had to look at not duplicating positions” like those in administration. Spicer added there were several retirements and other resignations happening independently of the acquisition that they were able to capitalize on, with an individual in St. Luke’s Registrar’s Office as an example, and “the rest of the staff positions were offered to the rest of the staff.”
Beyond questions of the combination process and how different groups will be affected, both Barber and Spicer said reactions to the news have been positive from students, staff and alumni.
Many of the people, both students and alumni, who are involved with one of the institutions actually have connections to the other as well, Barber said, from students starting in one program and transferring to another to complete their studies to working health care professionals boasting certifications from both Morningside and St. Luke’s through continuing education.
“It seems like this is a really good fit, because we had such strong relationships to begin with. And we know each other well, work with each other and stuff like that,” Barber said. “So there’s a long history with St. Luke’s.”

MONTPELIER — The economists tasked with diagnosing Vermont’s fiscal health every six months kept their top-line revenue estimates almost unchanged in a new report to a panel of lawmakers and Gov. Phil Scott on Friday.
However, Tom Kavet and Jeff Carr told the state’s Emergency Board, there are still numerous uncertainties for lawmakers to contend with as they develop a state budget for the upcoming 2027 fiscal year. Many are the result of actions taken over the past year by the Trump administration, like tariff, tax and immigration policies, they said.
Friday’s report details state revenue collections and pressures over the first half of the 2026 fiscal year, which started last July. 
State revenue over that time period varied less than 1% from the economists’ previous estimates, which were presented in July, Kavet and Carr said. Corporate tax revenue was down versus expectations, but that drop was offset by better-than-expected receipts from personal income taxes, according to the report.
Revenue from the state’s meals and rooms tax was also slightly down over estimates, a dip accompanied by decreased visitation from Canadian tourists, the economists said.
Legislative leaders and Scott had expressed concern in the leadup to Friday’s presentation that the economists would report a substantial downgrade in their revenue estimates. Though Friday’s news maintained the status quo — “holding the line,” the report said — lawmakers will still face a challenging budget-building cycle in the coming months. 
This story will be updated.

Family Friendly Ways to Celebrate MLK Day in Delaware
“Everybody can be great, because everybody can serve.” Those words from Martin Luther King Jr. continue to guide how communities across the country observe Martin Luther King Jr. Day. In Delaware, the holiday offers families a chance to honor Dr. King’s legacy not only through reflection, but through action and togetherness.
Two family friendly options stand out this year for those looking to spend the day serving others or enjoying time together in a meaningful way.
MLK Day Clean Up, Peace March, and Community Celebration
Families looking to put service at the center of the day can take part in the annual MLK Day Clean Up, Peace March, and Celebration in Wilmington. Now in its 14th year, the event is based at the MSK Community Center on the city’s West Side and brings neighbors together for a day rooted in care for the community.
The day begins with a morning neighborhood clean up, inviting volunteers of all ages to work side by side improving local streets and public spaces. Around midday, families and participants gather for a peace march that emphasizes unity and shared purpose. The event concludes with a community celebration that includes food, fellowship, and activities designed to welcome families and children.
The clean up, march, and celebration are free and open to the public, making it an accessible way for families to introduce children to the importance of service and civic pride. Full schedules, location details, and registration information can be found at:
https://www.westsidegrows.org/mlkday
YMCA of Delaware MLK Day Open Houses
For families seeking a more relaxed way to mark the holiday, the YMCA of Delaware will host free MLK Day Open Houses at its locations across the state. On MLK Day, families are invited to visit their local YMCA and enjoy access to facilities and family friendly activities.
YMCA open houses typically include opportunities for children to play, swim, and take part in age appropriate activities, while parents can explore programs focused on youth development, healthy living, and community connection. With locations in New Castle, Kent, and Sussex counties, the open houses offer a simple way for families to spend time together while reflecting on the values of inclusion and community that Dr. King championed.
Specific hours and participating branches vary by location. Families are encouraged to check details in advance at:
https://www.ymcade.org/event/mlk-open-house
A Meaningful Family Tradition
Martin Luther King Jr. Day is often described as a day on, not a day off. Whether families choose to roll up their sleeves at a community clean up or enjoy shared activities at the YMCA, these Delaware events offer age appropriate ways to honor Dr. King’s belief in service, unity, and compassion.
By participating together, families can help children understand that making a difference starts close to home and that everyone, regardless of age, has something valuable to contribute.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/mlk-day-march-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 11:58:11.949988

Idaho legislative committee recommends state revenue projection assuming continued growth

The Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC for short, was originally scheduled to take up a report from the Idaho Legislature’s Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee on Friday.
On Thursday, the Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee voted to recommend a revenue projection of $5.8 billion for next year, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. Notably, that revenue target is about $137 million more than the revenue projection Gov. Brad Little issued Monday in conjunction with his State of the State address. 
But rather than take action on the revenue committee’s recommendation on Friday, without any public explanation, JFAC leaders started Friday’s meeting about 20 minutes late, pulled back their agenda for the day and removed the agenda item for the Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee’s report.

 Why is setting a revenue projection important for state budgeting?

Setting a revenue projection is an important and closely watched step in setting the overall state budget because the Idaho Constitution requires the state to pass a balanced budget where expenses do not exceed revenue. In that regard, the revenue projection serves as the upper limit for what can be spent each year in the state budget. 
The revenue projection is taking on increased importance this year because Idaho has experienced revenue shortfalls, and both the fiscal year 2026 state budget and fiscal year 2027 budget are projected to run a deficit. 
Little and legislators have vowed to avoid a budget shortfall by cutting spending during the 2026 legislative session.

It was not immediately clear Friday morning when JFAC might take up action on setting a revenue projection
Last year, some legislators from both political parties criticized JFAC for delaying action on a revenue projection until March 5 – 59 days into the annual legislative session. Last year, legislators waited to set the revenue projection until after they had passed major budgets and tax cuts that reduced revenue.
“This is the wrong way to do our budgets,” Sen. Janie Ward-Engelking, D-Boise, said last year. 
“I believe this revenue projection should have been set at the beginning of the session, and then we work towards that number in everything that we do and the spending and in the tax reductions or the tax cuts,” Ward-Engelking added.

Last week, just before the 2026 legislative session started, Senate President Pro Tem Kelly Anthon, R-Burley, told reporters that Republican leaders were hoping to set the revenue target to base the budget around earlier in the legislative session this year. 
“We’ve decided, as majority leadership, to try to do a better job this session (by) really hitting the revenue projection early and to work better with the governor’s office to try to get to that revenue number quickly,” Anthon said Jan. 8. “We’ll see how that goes, but that is the goal.”
JFAC is scheduled to reconvene at 8 a.m. Monday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise.

Mike Mueller (R-Linden). Jan. 15, 2026. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. In an attempt to ensure tighter safety controls on Michigan’s cannabis industry, Rep. Mike Mueller (R-Linden) presented a bill to the Michigan House Rules Committee Thursday that would establish a statewide cannabis reference laboratory to standardize testing facilities across the state. 
The legislation, House Bill 4501, would establish a lab that was first given funding in the Fiscal Year 2024 appropriations and that has been in the process of opening since then. Derek Sova, a policy and legislative assistant for the Michigan Cannabis Regulatory Agency, explained to the committee that this bill was key to ensuring that the laboratory had the explicit authority to possess marijuana, given that it is still a federally illegal substance. 
There are currently 17 privately-owned and state-licensed compliance facilities or testing labs for cannabis in Michigan, Sova explained. But some growers will engage in what he called “lab shopping,” where they have their products tested by multiple labs until they get the results they want. 
Trump signs order to loosen federal restrictions on marijuana, but it’s still illegal

This lab, he said, “will allow us to go in and audit the test results of the private labs.”
“We are not looking to take over the responsibility of the testing ourselves,” Sova continued. “Our goal is to make sure that the labs testing themselves, that the labs have to do with the testing are getting the correct test results.”
He added that the lab would also allow for investigations to happen in-house, as opposed to asking a private lab to do the testing for the state.  
“All this would do is have one central state regulated lab that would be able to take samples from each laboratory that tests the marijuana to make sure that they’re not getting bad samples or being pushed around by some of the bigger growers to manipulate some of the findings with mold, things that can go wrong with marijuana,” Mueller said.
Representatives from the Michigan Cannabis Industry Association and the state’s Licensing and Regulatory Affairs office also expressed their support for the bill.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-16 16:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,How will the ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ impact your CT town?,Sasha Allen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/16/how-will-the-big-beautiful-bill-impact-your-ct-town/,Wealth and income inequality are projected to increase in Connecticut under President Donald Trump's 'Big Beautiful Bill.',"Wealth and income inequality are projected to increase in Connecticut under President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill,” with high-income residents seeing average tax breaks of nearly $10,000 and low-income residents paying an average of $417 more annually.
According to a new study released by DataHaven, the legislation will exacerbate wealth and income inequality primarily through rollbacks on some Medicaid and SNAP qualifications and tax cuts favoring high-income Americans.
Some towns, including Greenwich, Darien and New Canaan, could see average annual tax breaks of more than $30,000 for high-income residents, according to the study.
The returns from the bill are heavily skewed toward high-income households. Greenwich will see an estimated $262 million in tax relief, Stamford will see $239 million and Fairfield will see $158 million. Greenwich has some of the highest levels of income inequality in the state, according to U.S. Census data.
Bridgeport, the most populous town in the state, will receive an estimated net change of $60 million, with $61 million in tax relief going towards high-income households. The bottom 25% in Bridgeport will lose — primarily through cuts to SNAP, Medicaid and other social service programs — more than $14 million, and low-income households are projected to pay an average of over $1,000 more annually.
This distribution is the case nationally. Baseline projections from the Congressional Budget Office found that, under the bill, “changes in resources will not be evenly distributed among households.”
Households falling in the top and middle income distributions will see an increase in resources, while households in the bottom income distribution will see a decrease. This is due in part to changes to Medicaid and SNAP but also to federal tax provisions, including changes to student loan programs and to health insurance subsidy eligibility, according to a report from Phillip Swagel, the director of CBO.
DataHaven used the CBO report data, which did not consider the impact of tariffs or indirect effects of the bill. 
Connecticut already has some of the highest income inequality in the nation, the fourth-highest Gini Index out of all U.S. states and territories, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2023 five-year American Community Survey. The index measures income inequality, with one representing perfect inequality and zero representing perfect equality.
Puerto Rico, D.C., and New York rank above Connecticut. 
Norma Martinez HoSang is the director of Connecticut for All, a statewide coalition of labor, community, and faith organizations. She said the state already has a “upside down tax system” that H.R. 1 will make worse.
“In Connecticut and across the country, over the last many decades, what we’ve seen is the very wealthy continue to get like tax breaks, definitely at the state level,” HoSang said. 

But now, things are worse, she said. Families are already starting to feel the impacts of federal changes.
“These are families that were already living paycheck to paycheck, [with] really no margin to be able to figure out how to pay for stuff,” HoSang said. “We’ve seen some families go without eating. It is here now, and if we don’t do something as a state, those effects are going to quadruple in the next four years.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/mV1Gh-average-effect-of-h.r.-1-on-ct-towns--1024x809.png,,,2026-01-16 11:58:11.949988

Lamoille County Mental Health Services (LCMHS) is pioneering creative service options that work within local schools’ multi-tiered systems of support to identify and meet our youth’s social, emotional, and deve[...]","Stepping into the 25-26 school year, Lamoille County Mental Health Services’ (LCMHS) School Based Mental Health Services, like many of the Vermont Care Partners network agencies, partners with local school districts to address the changing needs of school communities. While continuing to offer Success Beyond Six services that are funded through local dollars, with a Medicaid match that assists in making services more affordable to schools and districts, LCMHS’ School Based Clinician and Redwood Behavior Interventionist (BI) programs have expanded to address current student needs. 
The youth mental health crisis, which began prior to and then was expounded upon by the pandemic, continues to impact our children and adolescents. Student challenges with attending, engaging, and maintaining a full school day due to social, emotional, behavioral, and/or developmental needs, require creative collaboration with community partners. Working within the Multi-Tier System of Support framework promoted by the Vermont Agency of Education, LCMHS School Based Directors, Lamoille Valley Directors of Student Support Services, School Administration, and Special Education Teams, continue to brainstorm options to meet student needs across the 3 Tiers.
This systems-level collaboration is grounded in nationally recognized frameworks that emphasize shared responsibility for social and emotional development. The chart below comes from the CASEL framework illustrating the importance of coordinated community support for social and emotional learning from the classroom to district and state levels. School Based Mental Health works across all tiers to help promote intentional social emotional development.



For more information visit https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/.
Tier 1 – Universal Supports
School Based Clinicians are an important part of their school community and play a vital role in supporting their school climate and student sense of belonging. They attend Student Support Team meetings, assist in connecting families to additional resources, and provide clinical consultation and training on an as needed basis, with school districts contracting for professional development specific to youth mental health needs and education in the Attachment, Regulation, and Competency framework. 



Tier 2 – Targeted Supports
Tier 2 Support contracts began last year and have expanded to this school year. This model begins with school identified students who need specific times of support during the school day. This model allows for flexibility in serving Medicaid and non-Medicaid students. Currently, the Redwood Behavior Interventionist Program is serving 28 students with only 13 students that have 1:1 Behavior Interventions.
School Based Clinicians provide targeted short-term support to students who are navigating difficult times and run 6–8-week groups that focus on specific areas of need per their school population. These groups range from managing anxiety, identifying and developing healthy relationships, navigating life transitions, building conflict resolution skills, to art and movement-based self-esteem pro-social groups. Throughout the school year, more than 200 additional students engage in small groups or short-term consultation work. Consultation work focuses on developing skills to manage current stressors and/or working with school and family teams to create developmentally appropriate language and plans to increase school engagement and communication.



Tier 3 – Individualized Supports
 The Redwood Behavior Interventionist (BI) Program provides 1 adult per child (1:1) support, 1:2, and if needed, 2:1 contracted support. These supports wrap a school and family with direct staff support at school, service coordination for home-school communication and transportation, and Behavior Consultants to create and track evidence-based plans. Goals focus on academic engagement and achievement, and/or specific life skills for developmental disabilities. 
Smaller mini contracts for Functional Behavior Assessments are offered on an individual basis to support school teams in creating behavior plans to increase student engagement and success. 
The Functional Skills Program is a new program created this year to address multiple student needs while focusing on their individual goals. The Redwood BI program partnered with Orleans South Supervisory Union and Lamoille South Supervisory Union (LSSU) to provide two days a week of support in each district. The school district identifies the students and offers the service to the family and goals are created as a treatment team. These services can happen in the community, in the LCMHS school wing, or at the school. Students receive a specific number of hours of one-on-one support without the need or cost of a full-time Behavior Interventionist. This program also supports transitional age youth (ages 15-26) with life skills that include community volunteer opportunities and connection to employment resources. 
Creating greater opportunities for early intervention has been identified as a top priority within Lamoille Valley. LCMHS is stepping in to partner with LSSU public preschools and early education classrooms to support programing for multiple students carrying diagnoses of Developmental Delays and Autism Spectrum Disorder. Included in this contract is parent and teacher training, which supports social, emotional, and communication skill development for kindergarten learning readiness.



LCMHS currently has 12 School Based Clinicians serving over 150 individual students in 12 schools across Lamoille North, Lamoille South, and Orleans South Supervisory Unions.
School Based Clinicians are licensed counselors, counselors working toward licensure under supervision and/or social workers who provide individual therapy to students that are struggling across home and school environments. Student treatment goals, developed by the School Based Clinician and student, address developmentally appropriate social emotional behavioral skills, so that students may develop a positive sense of self in school and life. With School Based Clinicians being embedded in the school building, therapy becomes a space to build skills and then generalize across settings. Parent/caregiver, school, and treatment team support is also provided. During times of crisis, School Based Clinicians connect families with LCMHS’ Mental Health Crisis Team and can support the Agency of Education Behavioral Threat Assessment process by being on the school Behavioral Threat Assessment and Management Team. 
Being flexible and creative while upholding the requirements of Success Beyond Six funding has built close partnerships between LCMHS and Lamoille Valley school partners. As LCMHS continues to navigate the uncertain funding landscape and the fast-paced world, LCMHS is dedicated to supporting the ever-changing needs of our students and community. When we work together, we can make a lasting impact on student wellness.

The U.S. Postal Service did not change its postmark rules, although it did change its Domestic Mail Manual to clarify how it postmarks mail. The USPS states mail is generally postmarked with the date it was first received at a processing facility.
What did recently change, according to the USPS, is its “transportation operations that will result in some mailpieces not arriving at our originating processing facilities on the same day that they are mailed.”
Some people have raised concerns about the mailing of bills, absentee ballots and other items that require a specific postmark date. Connecticut voters should not be affected by the potential delays because the state does not require a postmark to accept an absentee ballot, but that it is returned before polls close on Election Day.
Those concerned about a postmark date, however, can request a manual postmark at the time of the mailing.

(LRC Public Information)The Kentucky Senate gave near unanimous approval to allowing officials such as sheriffs and county clerks to renew driver’s licenses in counties without regional offices, sending Senate Bill 7 to the House for consideration.
Sen. Aaron Reed, R-Shelbyville, the bill’s sponsor, on Friday told his fellow senators that “the burden has fallen too heavily on the people.” 

 SB 7 progress


“Our constituents have told us clearly that the current system for driver’s license services is not working,” he said. “Long drives, long lines, missed work, missed school — for a basic government service.” 
The only senator to vote against the bill was Sen. Lindsey Tichenor, R-Smithfield. 
“It is not addressing the issues and I feel we should have,” she said. “We should be passing a stronger piece of legislation to start the work on.” 
Tichenor referred to a bill she proposed in 2025 that would have established at least one permanent, full-time, driver’s license regional office within each county with a population of 50,000 or more. 
In 2020 a law shifted driver’s licensing from circuit court clerks to the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, which led to the regional office system. The move helped Kentucky comply with federal requirements to offer Real ID driver’s licenses.
Kentucky established 34 regional offices that issue and renew driver’s licenses. Drivers would still have to go to a regional office for a new license under this legislation. It would allow counties without a regional office to choose one local official to offer license renewal services, who would charge a $25 additional fee to offset expenses. 
Counties with regional offices are “taken care of for now” and would keep all services at those offices, Reed said.
Return to ‘local control’ of driver’s license renewals is a priority for KY Senate GOP

During his weekly press conference on Thursday, Gov. Andy Beshear pointed to several factors that drove up wait times — which the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet says are now down to 11 minutes — including a 2025 law that let 15-year-olds get driving permits, federal enforcement of the REAL ID deadline and required vision screenings. 
“We think we’ve now gotten through that press of folks, that additional volume. Wait times are way down. Satisfaction is going up,” Beshear  said. 
His administration “may even have a counter proposal,” Beshear said, adding he would support having newly required vision screenings done at a more local level. 
“My concern about changing the system is everybody else is going to have to start from scratch now and go through possibly those six years  of the learning curve,” Beshear said. “I want to make sure that we don’t just scrap a system that we’ve worked six years to build and then start a new system from scratch, because I think we’ll have the same problems and concerns.” 
During a gaggle with reporters Thursday, Senate President Robert Stivers said the bill is just a “starting point” and could change as it moves through the legislative process. 
He said, as Reed has, that there is a need to address long drives to regional offices, long waits and insufficient staff. 
“The Transportation Cabinet, who is in charge of this under Gov. Beshear, has not been real responsive to a lot of the complaints that we have been hearing and receiving,” Stivers said. “So, we’re going to take our shot at it.”

(Photo courtesy of Byron Knutson family)A North Dakota man who marched with Martin Luther King Jr. and later served as the state’s insurance commissioner and labor commissioner has died. 
Byron Knutson, a Democrat, was elected insurance commissioner in 1976, but was defeated for reelection in 1980. He served in the North Dakota House of Representatives from 1959 to 1963 and served one term as Labor Commissioner from 1987 until 1991.
Knutson died Dec. 6, 2025, but his family waited until the week leading up to Monday’s Martin Luther King Day holiday to announce his death. 
“Profoundly inspired by King, our father devoted his life to public service,” Rebecca Knutson, Byron Knutson’s daughter, said in a statement. “There are still so many injustices happening in our world. Leaders like King and our father are desperately needed.”
Knutson grew up in Harlow in Benson County. He marched with King in 1965 after serving in the Korean War as a Marine, and then the North Dakota Legislature. 
“When Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. called upon the nation’s clergy and lay people to support the rights of African Americans and all people to vote without fear of losing their lives, I was ready to do my part,” Knutson said during an interview with Jim Shaw in 2021.
Tracy Potter met Knutson at the University of North Dakota in the early 1970s. 
“He was a firm believer in civil rights,” said Potter, a former Democratic state lawmaker. 
Potter later worked with Knutson in the Insurance Commissioner’s Office. In 1978, Knutson introduced Measure 4 that was intended to address health care costs, though voters turned down the constitutional measure. 
Knutson was among the Democrats who were voted out as Republican Ronald Reagan rose to the presidency. 
Knutson was appointed labor commissioner by Gov. George “Bud” Sinner in 1987. 
In 2011, Knutson and his wife, Bernice, received the first Governor Arthur Link and Grace Link Award for Lifetime Achievement from the North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party.
Potter said the couple’s commitment to making phone calls and the “grunt work” of Democratic-NPL politics was “inspiring.” 
“They were the most reliable people,” Potter said. “He was an inspiring character, always cheerful, a real happy warrior.”

It’s part of the Trump administration’s push to ramp up mass arrests and deportations using cash from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Congress passed last year at the president’s behest.
In an online advisory posted on Jan. 8, DHS laid out its proposal “to purchase, occupy and rehabilitate a warehouse property at 29 Elizabeth Drive, Chester, NY in support of ICE operations,” including erecting a small new guard building.  
The advisory, which was required because part of the 35.9 acre property sits in a flood plain, does not explicitly reference a jail. But The Washington Post reported last month about DHS’ plans for several new large-scale “processing facilities” for detainees, including one in Chester. 
Those new facilities are intended to hold immigrant detainees for a few weeks, according to the Post, before they are sent to large-scale warehouses in Virginia, Texas, Louisiana, Arizona, Georgia and Missouri that will each hold between 5,000 and 10,000 people.
The presumed location of the Chester processing center was first identified by The Monroe Gazette. The property is owned by an LLC linked to former Trump Advisor Carl Ichan, according to the Albany Times-Union.
The likely lock-up has triggered protests and contentious community meetings in Orange County, where Congressmember Pat Ryan (D) is circulating a petition to attempt to block the facility. 
Town of Chester Supervisor Brandon Holdridge said he was working with Ryan to “disincentivize this rogue, unlawful, and un-American agency from stepping foot in our town.”
Asked about their plans for the Chester warehouse, a spokesperson for ICE declined to provide specifics.
“Every day, DHS is conducting law enforcement activities across the country to keep Americans safe,” a statement from an unnamed spokesperson read. “It should not come as news that ICE will be making arrests in states across the U.S. and is actively working to expand detention space.”
“These will not be warehouses — they will be very well structured detention facilities meeting our regular detention standards.”
Since Trump took office last year, ICE has opened a new 1,000 person facility in Newark called Delaney Hall, entered into new contracts with several upstate county jails to detain dozens more, and sent around 100 detainees at any given time to the Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal prison in Sunset Park, Brooklyn.
The Chester facility would continue this trend and further enable ICE’s efforts to make more arrests in the New York City area, said Rosa Cohen-Cruz, the director of Immigration Policy at Bronx Defenders.
“Any increase in local bed space for ICE detention enables ICE to be more aggressive in their raids and their enforcement tactics because they have beds to immediately put people,” she said. “So we’re extremely concerned that New York City residents, New York State residents will really be at heightened risk by this increase in capacity.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26013668346196-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 11:58:11.949988
,CommonWealth Beacon,2026-01-16 14:48:43+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Next up on Beacon Hill: House leaders plan closed-door meetings on Healey’s energy affordability bill,Jordan Wolman,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/energy/next-up-on-beacon-hill-house-leaders-plan-closed-door-meetings-on-healeys-energy-affordability-bill/,"The political pressure to lower energy prices in the Bay State, home to the third-highest electricity costs in the country and rising gas bills, has intensified and will likely continue to escalate in an election year for both Healey and the Legislature.","LAWMAKERS AND ADVOCATES on all sides of the climate issue are gearing up again after the holiday slumber to advance a contentious energy affordability bill that left Beacon Hill scrambling during the waning days of last year’s session.  
House leaders are now planning a rare series of closed-door meetings for lawmakers next week totaling six hours divided between two days to discuss the path forward for legislation aimed at lowering the costs of energy that have animated residents across the state, according to an invitation viewed by CommonWealth Beacon.  
Those meetings will be led by Rep. Mark Cusack, a Democrat from Braintree who co-chairs the Telecommunications, Energy, and Utilities Committee, and House Ways and Means Chair Aaron Michlewitz. House Speaker Ron Mariano also plans to be in attendance, according to his spokesperson, Ana Vivas. 
The discussions will occur as the House looks to hash out the details of a complicated and sweeping policy proposal first kicked off by Gov. Maura Healey, who introduced her landmark energy affordability bill last spring after soaring energy costs prompted an outcry from residents around the state that continues to reverberate around the State House. 
The political pressure to lower energy prices in the Bay State, home to the third-highest electricity costs in the country and rising gas bills, has only intensified since then and will likely continue to escalate in an election year for both Healey and the Legislature. 
That pressure is coming from all corners. 
Cusack in November rewrote much of Healey’s original bill to use it as a vehicle to weaken the state’s ambitious 2030 climate commitments amid consternation about President Trump’s moves to rescind permits for clean power infrastructure. Cusack’s measure would also cut Mass Save, the state’s energy efficiency program, and reduce the amount of green energy that utilities are required to procure. That bill, which cleared his committee, exposed divisions within the Democratic supermajority and triggered a fierce backlash from environmental advocates. 
While Michlewitz threw cold water on touching the underlying climate goals and House leadership declined to rush Cusack’s legislation to a floor vote before lawmakers broke for the year, other pieces of the bill appear to be alive.  
There is genuine appetite among House lawmakers to cut or cap the Mass Save budget, according to one industry lobbyist and one lobbyist representing environmental groups, both of whom were granted anonymity to discuss the ongoing legislative negotiations.  
Mass Save, which is funded through ratepayers and appears as a line item on utility bills, is seen as one of the levers that the Legislature has in its control to immediately lower costs on bills, though the program is credited with saving substantial money and energy consumption over the long run through upgrades to homes. Cusack proposed capping the Mass Save budget at $4 billion, which would be a $500 million cut from the current budget approved by state regulators. (If approved, that cut would be in addition to the $500 million state officials removed from the program’s budget last March.) 
Such a move would have real consequences. Brian Swett, Boston’s first chief climate officer, said that cuts to Mass Save would directly impact the city’s ability to deliver on its Boston Energy Saver program that rolled out last year that aims to install thousands of heat pumps and provide free consultations to help lower gas and electric bills for residents. The crux of that effort relies on Mass Save. 
“We want to see Mass Save continue to be supported at the levels that we were reaching in the spring,” Swett said in an interview. “Fundamentally, we want to reinforce and not challenge the idea that the best thing we can do for Boston residents and ratepayers in all of Massachusetts, when it comes to energy affordability, is to reduce their need for energy.” 
Then there’s the question of who, at this point, has ownership over the legislation. The industry lobbyist said they are not sure who is actually finalizing the measure, noting that Cusack, Michlewitz, and Rep. Jeff Roy, who formerly led the House energy panel and now serves as a Mariano deputy in leadership, appear to be all vying for influence over the bill.  
Others don’t necessarily see that as a problem but rather an inevitability with an endeavor of this magnitude and consequence. 
“It makes sense there are several people involved because it’s complicated, technical, and the more heads you have on these types of issues to make sure we do it right, the better,” said the lobbyist representing environmental groups. 
Cusack, Michlewitz, and Roy all either didn’t respond to requests for comment or declined to comment on the record. 
Beacon Hill insiders likened the process playing out now over the energy affordability bill to the 2024 gun reform law. In that process, an initial gun reform bill in 2023 generated significant opposition, prompting a pair of closed-door, member-only meetings in July of that year. Mariano proceeded to punt further action until the fall, when a redrafted version – which limited the presence of firearms in public spaces, cracked down on “ghost guns,” and updated the state’s so-called red flag law – was released alongside a public hearing. 
Ultimately, after the Senate approved its own bill in 2024, negotiators agreed months later on what is now law following Healey’s signature. 
Earlier this week, Republicans released their own energy affordability measure focused on capping Mass Save’s budget, reforming utility contracts, and returning more money to ratepayers. In some respects, it isn’t wildly different from Cusack’s version, but it does serve to needle the majority party on how long the Democrats are taking to move on an issue seen as urgent and demonstrates an effort from the GOP to stake a claim in the efforts from Democrats to lower energy costs.    
“The majority has not rushed to come up with solutions,” said Rep. Brad Jones, the House Republican leader who co-sponsored the recently-released GOP energy bill. “The governor filed a bill many, many, many months ago. We’ve done nothing in response to her bill. Obviously the chair put out a bill, now we’re a couple months after that, and we’re now sitting down and having conversations. Look, we need to do something. Doing nothing doesn’t seem to be the best solution to a problem.” 
The fact that the House is even planning such a robust set of meetings on the issue next week, Jones said, shows that the Democratic caucus is “sort of all over the place” — but that there’s ultimately a hope that this process can produce something “consensus-driven.” 
Environmental groups are also looking to continue to shape the bill after they successfully beat back attempts to weaken the 2030 climate commitments. The Environmental League of Massachusetts posted on Wednesday that it is “actively engaged” at the State House on the legislation and is working to “ensure Massachusetts delivers real affordability solutions, accelerates clean energy progress, and stays firmly on track to meet its climate commitments.” 
Ultimately, though, the way the process has played out in just one chamber so far signals a long road ahead for any legislation that can tackle high utility bills. 
“If past is prologue,” Jones said, “it will certainly be many months before something is done, probably well after the heating season.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_9835-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-16 09:57:43.044116

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)TOPEKA — Kansas’ top health agency is sticking with the longstanding childhood immunization schedule instead of implementing new guidelines released Jan. 5 by the U.S. Centers for Disease Prevention and Control, a state spokeswoman said.
Although the Kansas Department of Health and Environment is evaluating the new vaccination schedule, KDHE does not currently anticipate changes to Kansas’ clinical guidance for childhood immunization schedules, spokeswoman Jill Bronaugh said in an email to the Kansas Reflector.
“KDHE is committed to the well-being of Kansans, and we continue to emphasize the importance of clear communication, transparency and trust in scientific evidence,” she said. “Vaccines remain one of the most effective tools for preventing serious infectious diseases, and decades of rigorous studies have shown they are safe and effective.”
KDHE will continue to review and assess the modified childhood vaccine schedule released by the CDC and how it could impact the health of Kansas children, Bronaugh said. In the past, the state’s vaccination schedule has followed the CDC’s recommendations.
The CDC’s newly released vaccination schedule dropped the number of childhood vaccinations from 17 to 10, a move vigorously disputed by leading health care organizations. 
“How often and how many vaccines children in the U.S. receive at certain ages is based on the times when vaccines will work best with children’s immune systems and when they are most vulnerable to certain diseases,” the American Academy of Pediatrics said. “Sometimes this means children will receive multiple shots in a short period of time. There is no medical reason to delay or skip recommended immunizations.”
Bronaugh said it’s important to rely on evidence-based sources when considering changes to the state’s vaccine recommendations that have longstanding success in protecting children’s health.
“It is also important to stress that childhood immunization schedules are intended to support, not require or mandate, evidence-informed, clinical decision-making and consistency in medical practice,” she said.
KDHE recommends that Kansas clinicians rely on their training and professional judgement, and that they follow the childhood and adolescent immunization schedules published by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians.
“We remain committed to supporting clinical guidance and recommendations that provide the most accurate, credible and transparent information available for health professionals and Kansas families,” Bronaugh said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/child-vaccination.jpg,,,2026-01-16 09:57:43.044116

People from […]","(Getty Images)Members of Alaska’s Court of Appeals appeared skeptical Thursday about Alaska prosecutors’ claim that a Whittier resident from American Samoa violated state law when she ran for school board in 2023.
In an hour-long oral argument, a three-judge appeals panel heard arguments for and against Tupe Smith, who is accused of elections misconduct.
People from American Samoa are U.S. nationals — they have some of the same legal rights as other Americans, but aren’t citizens. In 2023, the state of Alaska charged Smith with elections misconduct after she signed a document declaring that she was a U.S. citizen.
She has said she knew she couldn’t vote for President but didn’t know that she could not vote or run for office in local elections.
Since Smith was charged, the state has charged 10 other Whittier residents with similar crimes for almost identical reasons.
The case against Tupe Smith is in Anchorage Superior Court, but after a judge ruled against her request to have her indictment dismissed, she appealed the dismissal. 
Unusually, the appeals court took up the issue immediately, without waiting for the Superior Court to rule on Smith’s guilt or innocence. 
Thursday’s hearing, in front of a three-judge appeals panel, has broad implications. Alaska has charged 11 American Samoans from Whittier, including Smith, with elections-related crimes. If their cases go forward, similar charges may arise in the future against other Alaskans who believe they are eligible to vote but are actually ineligible. 
That isn’t a hypothetical issue: The Alaska Department of Motor Vehicles accidentally registered dozens of noncitizens to vote between 2022 and 2024, and many were sent voter cards. 
At issue is the difference between “intentionally” and “knowingly” in elections law — does someone commit misconduct if they accidentally affirm they are an American citizen, or must they be aware they are deceiving an elections official? 
There are relevant definitions in other parts of state law, but elections law may be different.
Attorneys representing Smith have argued that state law specifies that someone can’t break elections law unless they knowingly attempt to deceive elections officials. 
Smith didn’t intend to deceive, her attorneys argue, and even an Alaska State Trooper investigating the alleged crime got the law wrong, they said.
Attorneys representing the state have argued that in the context of elections law, intentionally and knowingly should be read similarly, but on Thursday, the appellate panel repeatedly questioned the state’s arguments.
“At least for me — I don’t know about the other judges — I don’t think it can possibly mean ‘knowingly.’ It has to mean something else. But what that something else is, is where I think it’s difficult,” said Judge Marjorie Allard.
Shortly afterward, Judge Bethany Harbison offered a similar remark.
“It does seem as though the Legislature did intend … that there be a kind of consciousness of wrongdoing … that it includes an intent to deceive, because that’s what this case seems to be ultimately about,” she said.
“If the issue is that you have to intentionally — meaning you have to want to make a false statement … then that’s a defense, and perhaps the grand jury would not indict it,” Harbison said.
At the end of the hearing, the justices took the case under advisement, with a written decision to be published later.

Ralph Norman speaks during a press conference on closed primaries at the Statehouse in Columbia, South Carolina on Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026. (Adrian Ashford/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A GOP congressman in a five-way race for governor is demanding that legislators close South Carolina’s primaries so that only registered Republicans can decide the party’s winner.
A hearing on two House proposals on primary voting is re-scheduled for next week, after initially being set for Thursday. U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman, who had arranged a news conference in the Statehouse for immediately after the meeting that didn’t happen, blasted the Legislature’s Republican leaders as not making the issue a priority and promised that if he’s elected governor, he would “use the bully pulpit to get this done.”
Gov. Henry McMaster, who helped build the GOP into South Carolina’s dominant party, made clear he doesn’t think it’s a good idea. If either bill makes it to his desk, he’d likely veto it, he told reporters a day earlier.
“I’d have to study them some, but if these bills, and I believe they do, impose obstacles to the people voting easily and freely, then I would veto them,” the former state GOP chairman said Wednesday at the Governor’s Economic Summit in Columbia.
That’s a strong warning from a governor who normally declines to weigh in publicly on a Republican-sponsored bill while it’s in the legislative process. His usual response over the last decade has been that he’ll wait until the final version reaches his desk to review it.
Republicans have tried repeatedly over the last quarter century that they’ve ruled both Statehouse chambers to bar anyone not registered as a member of a political party from voting in that party’s primaries. But proposals to do so have never gotten traction. McMaster’s veto threat suggests the idea won’t succeed this year either.
The argument has long been that Democrats are meddling in Republican contests and shouldn’t be allowed to help pick the Republican nominee.
“We can’t have those in the opposite party stopping people from being elected,” Norman told reporters in the Statehouse lobby.
But McMaster said allegations that Democrats are deciding the Republican nominees are overblown.
“People suggest that that’s going to happen in just about every election, and so far, since I’ve been involved in it … it never happened,” said McMaster, who was state GOP chairman for a decade before voters twice elected him attorney general, then lieutenant governor and, in 2018 and 2022, governor. “There may be a few pranksters that go out and do that, but we never have seen any significant amount of votes happening that way.”
In South Carolina, registered voters can vote in either party’s primary. They just can’t vote in both. And they can’t cross parties for primary runoffs. In other words, someone can’t vote in a Democratic Party primary, then vote in the Republican runoff two weeks later. They must stick with a single party for that election cycle.
The bill being pushed by Norman and the hardline House Freedom Caucus he helped found would require South Carolina voters to officially declare they’re a Republican or Democrat in order to vote in the party’s primaries. Voters who consider themselves independents could not cast a ballot unless a party chooses to allow their participation and tells the state Election Commission that in writing at least 60 days before a primary.
But Norman, a former state House member, clearly doesn’t think the state’s dominating party should do that.
The Rock Hill Republican called it “an 80% issue among Republican voters.”
That refers to results to a question the state Republican Party has repeatedly put on its primary ballot. Both parties can choose to put so-called advisory questions on their ballots, which they use to both attract voters to the polls and make the case to legislators that voters want something. But the results don’t actually carry any legal weight. In South Carolina, voters can’t change state law through a referendum.
As for the repeated closed primary question on the GOP ballot, many voters may not realize what it’s really asking. In February 2024, the last time it was on the ballot, voters were asked whether state law should “give people the right to register to vote with the political party of their choice.”
More than 73% of voters said “yes” to the right to get a choice.
In South Carolina, the primaries are usually the contests that matter. In most races, the winner of the primary wins the seat.
In 2024, the general election was a given for more than half of the Statehouse’s 170 seats; 80 incumbents, plus candidates for six open seats, faced no major party opposition, according to an analysis by the SC Daily Gazette.
Two of last month’s three special elections for Statehouse seats had no Democrat on the ballot. The Republican primaries months earlier decided the winner.
Rep. Jordan Pace, chairman of the Freedom Caucus that publicly wars with the House’s majority GOP caucus, said the primary won by now-Rep. Dianne Mitchell is an example of Democratic meddling. Mitchell, a former teacher that the Freedom Caucus backed, narrowly won in a primary runoff by 20 votes.
Mitchell told the SC Daily Gazette that a Democratic activist encouraged Democrats to vote for one of her opponents in the four-way primary two weeks earlier, when she came in second. In South Carolina, a runoff is required if no candidate takes at least 50% plus one vote.
“It’s not my fault they can’t find a candidate to run,” she said of Democrats.
The House GOP caucus is backing a separate bill that would prevent crossover voting while allowing people who didn’t choose a party to participate in either party’s primary.
It would guarantee that “registered members of an opposing party can’t vote in our primaries on the day of the election,” said its main sponsor, Rep. Brandon Newton, R-Lancaster, adding “I would personally never support a system that doesn’t allow independents to vote.”
However, under his proposal, voting in a primary would automatically register that unaffiliated voter with that party, though the voter could apply through the state Election Commission to undo that.
The South Carolina Republican Party appeared to favor Newton’s bill. An email blast to the party faithful Thursday headlined “Protect the Integrity of Republican Primaries” included the bill number for the House GOP caucus bill.
In the past, some Republican candidates have outright courted Democratic voters. A super PAC backing former Gov. Nikki Haley sent out mailers encouraging Democrats to vote for Haley instead of President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential primary, according to copies of the mailers obtained by NBC News.
But Trump still trounced Haley, winning 59.8% of the vote to her 39.5%.
For their part, state Democratic leaders have said they want Democrats voting in their primaries, not Republican primaries.
“The idea that Democrats can strategically swoop in, outsmart thousands of Republican primary voters, and engineer a reasonable GOP nominee is not a strategy; it’s a fantasy,” state Democratic Party Chairwoman Christale Spain wrote in a November opinion piece in The Post and Courier re-posted on the state party’s website.
“If Republicans want to nominate less extreme candidates to be more palatable to most South Carolina voters, that’s their job, not ours,” Spain said.
Only 14 other U.S. states have an open primary system like South Carolina’s. Five states let voters cross party lines but automatically register them with the party whose primary they vote in, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Eight states open party primaries to unaffiliated voters but not members of the opposite party. Only eight states have totally closed primaries that require voters to be registered with a party to vote in its primary.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_2803-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-16 09:57:43.044116

Steve Daines has roiled politicos in the Treasure State but insiders are at odds over how the military veteran and former GE vice-president’s potential independent candidacy could influence the race. 
Although Bodnar has not announced his intentions himself, multiple people have confirmed to the Daily Montanan that he has been considering a run for the Senate seat and is likely to make a decision soon.
While Bodnar is widely believed to be considering running as an independent, some Democrats believe a better chance of unseating Daines would run through party infrastructure. 
Bodnar himself has not declared a party affiliation and has been largely apolitical while at UM. He did not respond to an email from the Daily Montanan.
The last Democrat to hold statewide office, former U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, allegedly expressed support in a text for an independent Bodnar campaign while beating down on the Democratic Party, calling it “poison” during his own re-election attempts, according to a report from Lee Enterprises. 
Tester did not respond to calls from the Daily Montanan, but Thursday on his podcast, “Grounded,” he said Lee’s headline incorrectly painted him as unsupportive of Democrats. 
On the national scene political analysts are expecting a blue wave during the midterms as voters swing away from the incumbent Republican Party, which holds a governing trifecta in D.C.. But Democratic candidates in Montana are not very well known. 
Bodnar, on the other hand, is already a familiar name in Montana to both political players and the public.
He was floated as a potential candidate against Daines during the 2020 election, according to one state political operative, before former Gov. Steve Bullock was recruited into the race. 
The Rhodes Scholar and Truman Scholar at the University of Oxford also has a resume that matches many Montana politicians.   
He graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. In the military, Bodnar served as a Green Beret in the Army First Special Forces Group and when he moved to Montana he joined the state’s National Guard. His military service puts him in line with other recently elected Montanans, including Navy Seals Ryan Zinke in the western house district, and Tim Sheehy, who unseated Tester, the last Democratic official to win the state’s other senate seat in 2024. 
Daines is the only Montanan in Congress without a military record. 
Bodnar worked for General Electric as a senior executive, and in 2018, was tapped as president of the University of Montana, where he has been ever since. 
A spokesperson for UM would not provide any comment about the speculation of a candidacy, other than confirming that no decisions had been made by the university president. 
But independent candidates are a longshot in any political race, much less a U.S. Senate race with a hugely advantaged two-term incumbent.
Daines, now the state’s senior senator, chaired the powerful National Republican Senatorial Committee, the campaign organization for Senate Republicans, last election cycle, achieving a major goal of unseating Tester, and in doing so, eliminating Democrats from all state-wide offices. 
In his 2020 re-election race, Daines came away with a 10-point victory in a race that had been seen as more competitive, due to the recruitment of popular two-term former Gov. Bullock as the Democratic nominee. 
Despite Daines’ inherent advantages, and perhaps buoyed by a national narrative that voters will swing left during the midterm, multiple Democrats have jumped into the race to challenge him.
Reilly Neill, a former legislator from Livingston, has been the primary figure in the race since she announced in late 2024. Neill briefly ran in the Democratic primary for the 2020 governor’s race, and mounted a write-in campaign for the state’s eastern House district in 2024 after Democratic nominee John Driscoll ran a low-budget campaign. 
Neill said she isn’t concerned about the possibility of Bodnar’s third-party run, calling him a “corporate shill” and saying she wants to know who is backing his run — including her suspicion that money might be flowing from powerful Republicans seeking to split the votes against Daines. 
The Cook Political Report ranks the Montana seat as “Solid Republican.”
Neill also said that the alleged message from Tester, which disparaged her chances of beating Daines, was “not a good look” for the former Senator. 
“Honestly, he can say whatever he likes about me,” Neill told the Daily Montanan. “I’m interested in the people of Montana, I’m on the ground, out there every day, meeting people face to face.”
“We’re having a good Democratic primary for the Senate, and Daines is on the run,” she added.
Alani Bankhead, of Helena, announced her candidacy for the seat in a video last week, touting her background with the Air Force, as a bodyguard to a “top Pentagon leader,” and her work on a task force combating internet crimes against children. 
The Federal Election Commission also shows Michael Hummert, a self-described “realist liberal Democrat,” and Michael Black Wolf, a preservation officer and community leader from the Fort Belknap Indian Community, have both filed to run as Democrats, while perennial candidate Charles Walking Child has filed as a Republican. 
Other candidates could not be reached for comment about the likelihood of a high-profile challenge from the UM president in time for this story.
Shannon O’Brien, the Democratic Party chair, said that the party’s role during the primary is to be unbiased and support all Democratic candidates, and that it is always recruiting and encouraging individuals to run for office.  
“We believe there is a blue wave that is happening right now,” O’Brien said. “Daines is vulnerable. Zinke is vulnerable. All of the Republicans are vulnerable right now. People are not happy with what’s happening in D.C.”
She answered questions about whether the party would consider supporting a third party bid by emphasizing her role in getting Democrats in office. But she also pointed to a value that unites the party.
 “We’ve got a job to do to get Republicans interested in tax breaks for the wealthiest out of office. That’s our job, as a party, and it’s my job to keep us laser-focused on that.”
At least in theory, a political party can also serve as a vehicle for a structured campaign. Some in the state Democratic Party have thrown additional doubt on the efficacy of Bodnar’s potential run as a third-party candidate without the cohesion of a party’s statewide campaign machine. Candidates at the top of the ticket — congressional seats for the 2026 election — can bolster or suppress support down the ballot, and convening multiple candidates for events is easy if they’re under the same party umbrella. 
But a financially-backed independent candidate could peel off voters from either party. As president of one of Montana’s flagship institutions, Bodnar would not be a new face to at least some voters, having traveled the state to boost enrollment and respond to calls to help UM form a deeper connection to communities in eastern Montana.
Tester’s text message, which cast doubts on the state party’s ability to continue winning in Montana, seemed to hold up an independent run as the way forward, but on his podcast, Grounded, Tester said that reporting on the subject had mischaracterized his views and support of the Democratic Party. 
“I spent the last 25 years, quite frankly, working to make sure that the Democratic Party can win, and that not only goes from Montana, but around the country,” Tester told his cohost Maritsa Georgiou.
Tester, held up as the last remnant of Montana’s former hybrid-purple political scene, has clashed with the state party since he left office.. 
O’Brien said she’d seen Tester’s text, but said there was likely some missing context, and her job remains to “get Democrats elected at all levels.”
“I’m proud to be a Democrat and serve as chair of our party,” O’Brien told the Daily Montanan.

(Getty Images)As a physician, it is clear to me that our mental health is one of the most important components of our overall health. 
Untreated mental health disorders can have a profound effect on our physical health and contribute to chronic health conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes, but the human cost extends even further. 
Undertreatment of mental health disorders also contributes to poor academic performance, poor job performance, poor job stability, and homelessness. Especially in rural states, like New Hampshire, the impact of underfunding mental health care and substance use disorder treatment is very apparent. 
For these reasons, the Trump administration’s tactics of abruptly pulling $2 billion of grant funding for these vital services, and then reinstating the funding only after severe and immediate bipartisan backlash, is very troubling. 
Earlier this week, the Trump administration announced its intention to abruptly terminate $2 billion of grant funding for mental health care and treatment of substance use disorders, stating that the programs supported by these funds no longer align with federal governmental priorities. 
Within the next day, they reversed course. In the meantime, however, the impact of disruption to this funding for Granite Staters became abundantly clear. Organizations such as NAMI New Hampshire use these funds to provide a wide range of services, from children’s mental health care to suicide prevention, as well as crisis prevention training for first responders. Multiple school districts in our state use these funds to provide not just mental health care for students, but also to provide resources for food insecurity, housing insecurity, or substance use. 
New Hampshire, on one hand, has been one of the states most affected by the mental health crisis and opioid epidemic. We have seen that without adequate mental health care services, Granite Staters have no other option than to turn to already overcrowded emergency departments for mental health care. On the other hand, we have also seen the difference that funding evidence-based treatments such as medication-assisted treatment for substance use disorders or harm reduction strategies like needle exchanges can make in our patients’ lives. 
These successive announcements by the federal government demonstrated that beyond the disruption and the chaos, there is a real human cost and lives that hang in the balance. 
For the moment, funding has been restored but the message has become clear that these vital services — services providing critical support for Granite Staters and our children — are vulnerable and not a priority for our federal government. Tactics such as abruptly pulling funding without prior notification follow a dangerous precedent set by our current administration and pose direct harm to our mental health safety net organizations, and more importantly, to Granite Staters and all Americans. 
As a physician and a Granite Stater, I find this to be unacceptable. The lives of those who depend on these vital mental health services should not be subject to governmental whims. The lives and well-being of our citizens, and the health of our communities should always be the priority.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/opioids-1024x628.jpeg,,,2026-01-16 09:57:43.044116

Darin Chappell of Rogersville speaks in March 2024 during Missouri House debate (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).A plan to add Medicaid work requirements to the state Constitution was debated by a Missouri House committee this week, with Republican lawmakers hoping to put the issue before voters later this year.
The proposed ballot measure, if approved by a majority of Missouri voters, would make it more difficult for the state to reverse federal restrictions on Medicaid eligibility included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed by Congress this summer if those requirements change in the future. 
“The reality of it is this is coming to Missouri, irrespective of this,” said state Rep. Darin Chappell, a Rogersville Republican sponsoring legislation that would propose the change. “This is just saying we should keep it that way.”
Starting Jan. 1, 2027, the federal law will require adults ages 19 to 64 who are covered as part of Medicaid expansion to show that they work, volunteer or study at least 80 hours a month to qualify for the health care program for low-income people. The law also requires states to recertify enrollees’ eligibility every six months instead of once a year.
Proposed federal work requirements could cut over 90k Missourians from Medicaid

With Missouri’s Department of Social Services requesting an additional $131 million to cover costs this fiscal year of implementing the federal law, state lawmakers debated during the Tuesday hearing of the House Legislative Review Committee whether work requirements would slash MO HealthNet costs or add to the expense of implementing the federal law.
Chappell said the intent of his legislation is “to mirror what has been done at the national level already.” He believes the constitutional amendment would save Missouri money.
“There will be individuals who were not the original intent of Medicaid and choose not to engage in the work requirements that will not have access to Medicaid any longer,” Chappell told The Independent.
Medicaid eligibility changes in the federal law could cause 130,000 Missourians to become uninsured in the next decade, according to one estimate from Princeton University. There were 363,641 MO HealthNet adult expansion enrollees in December, an all-time high, according to data from the state social services department.
The ballot measure described in Chappell’s joint resolution is not identical to changes the federal law makes to Medicaid eligibility. While the measure would require the Missouri Department of Social Services to go back three months in an individual’s employment history to verify that they meet work requirements, the federal law only requires states to check one month prior to enrollment. And Chappell left open how often the department would have to verify that current enrollees are still meeting requirements.
“Some of this is going to have to be departmental capacity,” Chappell said. “I don’t know that it’s every 30 days.”
Democrats insisted the fiscal note attached to the legislation didn’t reveal the full costs of the changes and questioned why lawmakers should amend a section of the state constitution recently changed by a popular vote of Missourians.
Missourians voted in 2020 to expand Medicaid, opening eligibility to people earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level, though enrollment did not begin until Oct. 2021 because state lawmakers refused to fund it.
State Rep. Aaron Crossley, a Democrat from Independence, asked Chappell if he had considered a “trigger law” that would change statute to reflect the federal law, but only as long as the federal law remains in force. 
“Why not do that and then say, ‘OK, we’ll go back to what the voters approved a few years ago when federal law likely changes?” Crossley said.
Chappell emphasized that if his bill passes, voters will have final say about the constitutional amendment.
“If we believe in the will of the people, as I certainly do, why are we so afraid to let them speak again, to modify what’s already been said?” Chappell said in an interview with The Independent. “How is that horrible?”
The fiscal note included only the projected cost of putting Chappell’s proposal on the ballot in November, which comes out to roughly $9 million. 
But State Rep. Jo Doll, a Democrat from St. Louis, said that if voters approved the measure, the cost to the state would be much higher. 
“Where are we going to find the workers?” Doll said. “Because it’s going to take a lot of people to verify that someone has been working for three months prior and every month following.”
Gov. Mike Kehoe’s executive budget for fiscal year 2027 recommends a reduction of 238 staff in the state’s social services department, which is in charge of eligibility and enrollment for MO HealthNet. The recommended cut includes a reduction of 173 “income maintenance” staff, who according to a description in the department’s budget request, “determine eligibility for assistance programs.” 
In its supplemental budget request for the current fiscal year, the department asked for an additional $9 million in state general revenue and $123 million in federal funds to implement the federal law — partly to pay for income maintenance system updates. The department requested another $530 million to cover the adult expansion Medicaid population.
Chappell underlined that the ballot measure would not affect people exempt from federal work requirements due to disability or pregnancy.
But Crossley, who works in health care and has helped clients apply for Medicaid, said he has seen people lose coverage for administrative reasons that they were legally entitled to.
“If they miss one piece of mail and it’s time for them to renew their Medicaid…[or] they miss that one notification, then they’re off their insurance,” Crossley said.
Chappell acknowledged that some costs of more uncompensated care as more Missourians go uninsured could fall to taxpayers, but he said he believes the constitutional amendment would help people in the long run.
“If we encourage people to go to work, and we change the dynamic of their world view…so that they become part of the working population, I think we’ll see that they’ll increase their money that’s available to them,” Chappell told The Independent. “They’ll create for themselves skill sets whereby they can get employed and thereby have healthcare access through their employers.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Chappell-031224-0728-1-1024x614.jpeg,,,2026-01-16 09:57:43.044116

(Courtesy of Johnny Sundby Photography)Don Barnett, who died Monday at age 83, was the 29-year-old mayor of Rapid City when it was struck by a flood that killed 238 people on June 9, 1972. He received widespread praise for leading the recovery and helping to ensure that the city never again overbuilt in the Rapid Creek floodplain.
Barnett was photographed by Johnny Sundby and interviewed by Seth Tupper — now the editor of South Dakota Searchlight — for a 2022 book, “Surviving the ’72 Flood,” and a South Dakota Public Broadcasting documentary and podcast of the same name. Searchlight’s Joshua Haiar also worked for SDPB at the time and contributed graphics, music and video editing to the documentary.
The book chapter about Barnett is reprinted here as a tribute to the former mayor.
—
“On foot.” That’s how Don Barnett says he got himself elected mayor of Rapid City in 1971. A wise local adviser told him where he could win wards and precincts, and where he didn’t have a prayer.
It was valuable advice for a 28-year-old Democrat running in a strongly Republican town. Barnett took a color-coded map onto the streets and walked his way through a Rapid City winter and early spring, knocking on doors.
It worked. That April, Barnett became the youngest person to serve as mayor of Rapid City.
A little more than a year later on June 9, 1972, Barnett attended a conference in Rapid City on death and dying, which drew 420 people from the fields of medicine, ministry and the law.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Early that evening, he took his family swimming at the local YMCA. A police officer showed up around 7 p.m. and said more than a dozen urgent messages awaited Barnett at City Hall. Rapid Creek was expected to flood.
“And I’ll tell you, I just felt like a bowling ball was suddenly in my gut,” Barnett said.
He joined other local leaders springing into action. All the city’s police officers and firefighters were called to duty. The National Weather Service was issuing warnings about potentially high water, but as Barnett recalls, nobody anticipated the scale of the impending disaster.
Barnett responded to early flood reports on the city’s west side. He lent a hand to a utility crew turning off a natural gas line with a giant wrench near the Canyon Lake bridge. Under the pouring rain, Barnett said he was “wet from my head to my underwear to my toenails.”
“And as the crew went to put the tools away,” Barnett said, “we saw a little car that was bouncing in Rapid Creek.”
The car disappeared under the bridge, and soon there was a loud crunching noise. The Canyon Lake bridge floated into the lake.
Barnett recalls saying, “I’ll put a hyper-warning out absolutely right now.”
That was around 10:30 p.m. Barnett went to the nearby Canyon Lake Club and called local broadcaster Robb Dewall at KOTA radio and TV. Dewall aired Barnett’s plea to evacuate low-lying areas along the creek. But KOTA lost electrical power about 20 minutes later, and about 70 percent of the city was already without power for radios and televisions.
And by then, a deadly flood surge was underway.
Several feet of water inundated Jackson Boulevard near Meadowbrook Golf Course. Local Air Force airmen on the scene joined Barnett and Police Chief Ron Messer as they attempted to rescue people from homes along the creek, but the water was too high and the current was too strong.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Barnett used a megaphone to warn people there was no rescue in the short-term; he told them to climb atop their roofs and hold onto their chimneys. The rest of the night passed in a blur of activity as the mayor and other officials responded to devastation up and down the creek.
Two days later, Barnett convened a meeting of the City Council at the courthouse. Disaster-response specialists from the federal government wanted to replace the ravaged mobile-home parks along the creek with temporary housing.
That’s when Rapid City’s public works director, Leonard “Swanny” Swanson, uttered the words Barnett says are “tattooed on my brain and on my soul.”
“No,” Swanson began, according to Barnett. “We cannot sentence the survivors to one more night on the suicidal floodplain.”
Barnett called for a vote, and it was unanimous. There would be no reconstruction of the destroyed residential areas alongside the creek. The temporary housing, and the permanent rebuilding effort, would move to other parts of the city.
That’s why a greenway and a paved recreational trail — named the Leonard F. Swanson Memorial Pathway — parallel the creek’s winding course through the city today, ensuring no future flood will wreak as much death and devastation as the Rapid City Flood of 1972.

Scheduling note: WhatMatters is taking Monday off to honor Martin Luther King Jr. and will be back in your inboxes Tuesday.
In 2024, California and Google made a deal to spend $175 million over five years on local journalism. This deal came after Google spent $11 million lobbying against two bills that would have required the $4 trillion company to pay newsrooms for using the news they create. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom’s latest budget proposal has no money for that fund. The deal struck between the state and Google, one of the most valuable companies in human history, calls for the tech giant to match state funding. That’s according to Erin Ivie, a spokesperson for Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, an Oakland Democrat instrumental in brokering the deal. So, if the state contribution to the local journalism fund is zero dollars, Google’s contribution to the fund will be zero dollars. 
There are no legal consequences if Google never contributes more money to the agreement. 

Ivie: “The deal was never etched in paper and signed by any party — it was a handshake agreement in principle, and no parties are legally bound to its terms. There was never any penalty or consequence built into the agreement, as the arrangement is voluntary, not coercive.”

So far, not even the $20 million that California and Google collectively put into the fund has made it to newsrooms, writes CalMatters’ Yue Stella Yu. 
As Stella notes in her story, a 2019 study estimated that in one single year (2018), Google made $4.7 billion from news sites. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, reported making over $100 billion in the third quarter of 2025 alone. 
More than 3,200 newspapers have closed since 2005, according to one estimate. Google — which directly benefits from news without having to pay the cost of reporting, illustrating, editing or publishing the news — could pay its part of the original $175 million arrangement hundreds of times over with its 2025 third quarter revenue alone. 
Newsom’s office referred questions to Go-Biz, which said the $20 million will be distributed this year.

State Auditor releases report on housing department

From CalMatters housing reporter Ben Christopher:
State regulators at the Department of Housing and Community Development have spent the last five years forcing local governments to plan for more new housing in a lengthy, technical process that has left virtually every group involved fuming.
Local governments have bemoaned mandates, which they call unrealistic, and say HCD has foisted upon jurisdictions in an unclear or inconsistent way.
“Yes in my backyard” activists, who want to see local governments allow much more construction, have critiqued HCD for being too lenient on cities and counties that drag their feet. 
Now, in a long-awaited report, the California State Auditor’s office has issued its judgment: HCD is doing fine, more or less.
The department met its deadlines in offering local feedback, which was “precise” and “generally consistent,” the report found. 
The auditor did offer a handful of recommendations to spread out HCD’s workload and beef up communication between the department and locals. But for local governments looking for vindication or pro-development activists hoping the auditor would champion a more aggressive state crackdown, the report makes for a disappointingly lukewarm read.



Californians rally for health coverage


Advocates gather to call on leaders to address threats to health care coverage on the steps of the state Capitol in Sacramento on Jan. 14, 2026. Photo by Roberta Alvarado for CalMatters




With some analysts estimating that more than half a million Californians would lose Medi-Cal coverage this year due to funding cuts, a coalition of health care advocates, labor unions and progressive legislators rallied at the state Capitol to push lawmakers to find new money to fund medical care, report CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller and Jeanne Kuang.
Under President Donald Trump, billions of dollars in federal funding have been cut from California’s social services programs, including the state’s Medi-Cal program. Demonstrators on Wednesday called for Gov. Newsom and the Legislature to backfill those cuts, particularly to protect the millions of low-income and disabled Californians who would be left especially vulnerable.

Judy Mark, president of Disability Voices United, at the rally: “We know that you are not responsible for these awful cuts, but now the responsibility does lie in your hands. You have the power to protect us.”

The event underscores the dilemma Newsom faces in his last year as governor, and whether he should increase taxes — a politically thorny endeavor — or allow millions of Californians to lose their health coverage.
One major labor union has proposed a ballot initiative to impose a billionaire tax to make up the federal cuts, which Newsom opposes.

Look at school officials,Glenn Sacks,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2026/01/teachers-grade-inflation-california-schools/,UC-San Diego reports declines in freshman math skills despite rising grades in K-12 schools. Teachers say they're pressured to inflate grades.,"Guest Commentary written by

Glenn Sacks
Glenn Sacks teaches high school Government in the Los Angeles Unified School District


After a recent University of California at San Diego report documented a decline in incoming freshmen’s math skills — despite K-12 school grades edging ever upwards — conservative critics have been blaming teachers and their unions for grade inflation. 
Grade inflation is assigning artificially higher grades for a level of school work that in the past merited lower grades. Put another way, it’s the increase in average grades awarded to students over time, absent higher academic achievement.
Columnist Karol Markowicz condemns teachers for letting “students’ grades balloon,” saying educators are falling down on the job. The editorial board of the Southern California Newspaper Group blames the crisis on teachers unions which, they claim, have been “let off the hook,” but whose “power will have to be curbed.”
But teachers are usually the ones resisting grade inflation. They’re usually demanding rigor and accountability. Also, our unions don’t tell us how we should grade; instead they defend our discretion in grading. 
So where does this grade inflation come from? School districts and school administrators. 
In the Los Angeles Unified School District, as in many others, teachers have been under pressure to eliminate most failing grades and to reduce the number of D’s they award.
In one low-performing high school, for example, after every five-week grading period, each teacher receives a grade summary with a chart showing how many of their students are getting D’s or F’s compared to the school as a whole. Each low grade is highlighted in bright red. 
Included is a lecture from the district that “a disproportionate number of Fails or D’s for any reporting period or for a single assignment immediately signals the need for revising the instructional program.”
At some schools, giving low grades has become a laborious process. It is not enough that report cards relay the message that the student is “in danger of failing.”  To give a low grade, teachers must also repeatedly contact parents and then log each contact. 
Teachers are already overloaded with paperwork. And in the face of having to deal with 30 to 40 sets of parents, teachers have a large incentive to say, “This is too much work; I’ll just give them all C’s” — which is, of course, part of these requirements’ purpose.
Yet people with a stake in education have numerous legitimate incentives to inflate grades. 
Many districts, including Los Angeles,  suffered significant enrollment drops during and after COVID. School officials perceive, not unreasonably, that making it easier for students to pass and graduate leads to better attendance and higher enrollment. 
In California, schools are funded by attendance. Administrators are right to protect their budgets and avoid the pain and rancor of layoffs. For them, grade inflation is a useful tool.
Another problem with strict grading: students who have no hope of passing a class are much more likely to become discipline problems. 
Late in a semester, there’s a tendency to have “travelers” — students who don’t attend classes because they know they can’t pass. They rove the campus, dodging school authorities. In these cases, administrators, deans and teachers all have an incentive to give everybody a chance to pass.
In large public school systems, many students come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Some critics blame measures designed to help these students for the problems UCSD reports.
Education author Lance Izumi alleges “many schools emphasize equity over merit,” while education reformer Robert Pondiscio condemns “K–12 education’s love affair with ‘equity’,” calling it “intellectually bankrupt.”  
Teachers are continually whipsawed between demanding good attendance, hard work and accountability and making accommodations for students whose home lives are difficult. 
A few weeks ago Immigration & Customs Enforcement nabbed and deported the fathers of two of my seniors. Both students are now working full time to support their families, while also trying to stay on track to graduate. 
Other students have been homeless, forced by circumstances to move far away, fear coming to school because of ICE or are just hungry. Rigor and accountability are great in the abstract, but in practice, teachers cannot ignore their students’ struggles.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/030525_Delano-Schools_LV_CM_08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-16 08:57:49.636586

Gavin Newsom devoted most of his final State of the State address last week to touting what had been accomplished during the past seven years, and one boast was about California’s public school system educating nearly 6 million kids in grades K-12.
Newsom said his new budget would increase spending on the system to $27,418 per student, which includes federal money. He highlighted expansions in pre-kindergarten, programs before and after school and the melding of education with social and health care programs in “community schools.”
“These multi-year investments in education, they are paying off,” Newsom told legislators. “Just this year, we’ve seen improved academic achievement in every subject area, in every grade level, in every student group, with greater gains in test scores for Black and Latino kids. These gains are particularly pronounced in Los Angeles, the nation’s second-largest school district.”
It sounded great but must be placed in a not-so-wonderful context.
Overall, California’s public school test scores not only fare poorly in comparison to those in other states, but have lost ground in some key areas, as latest results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress revealed in September.
In fourth-grade reading skills, a vital area since reading comprehension is the door to mastering all other subjects, California ranked an embarrassing 37th among the states in 2024 tests. Just 29% of its students achieved proficient levels, down two points from 2022. Black and Latino fourth-graders appeared to struggle the most.
California’s low reading scores should not be a surprise to anyone who has observed the state’s decades-long conflict over how it should be taught, dubbed the “reading wars.” For too long, California’s education leaders insisted on experimenting with trendy theories of reading instruction, such as “whole language,” while dismissing advocates of time-tested phonics as old-fashioned and even reactionary.
Other states acted while California fiddled around, having concluded that the way previous generations of students mastered reading was still valid. One of them was Mississippi, one of the nation’s poorest states.
As the New York Times recently reported in great detail, Mississippi was 49th in fourth-grade reading proficiency in 2013, but state leaders acknowledged the damage and decided to do something about it. Central to the state’s reform was adoption of the “science of reading,” the current name for phonics, while targeting efforts on kids in the early grades in an effort to prepare them for learning at all levels.
“Science of reading is really important; it was a key piece of what we did,” Rachel Canter, who heads an education reform group Mississippi First, told the Times. “But people are missing the forest for the trees if they are only looking at that.”
Mississippi also set tough academic standards and state political leaders made improvement a top-drawer issue — not just one of many. The latest national assessments found that Mississippi now has the ninth-highest fourth-grade reading scores.
It’s odd that, as Newsom ticked off points of educational pride, he didn’t mention the most important one: California’s adoption of phonics as its primary reading instruction last year. The new law enjoyed strong support from a governor who struggles with dyslexia.
Newsom’s boast about per-pupil spending exemplifies the Capitol’s focus on money in its education debates, rather than results. While a much smaller state, Mississippi spends scarcely half of what California does yet does a better job of teaching children to read.
Over the next few years, we’ll learn whether California’s educational establishment will finally embrace phonics, and whether we can catch up with Mississippi.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/020623-T.-Griffin-Stege-Elementary-SK-CM-12.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-16 08:57:49.636586

Guest Commentary written by

Eduardo Vargas
Eduardo Vargas is running for Insurance Commissioner as a socialist with the Peace and Freedom Party. He teaches high school environmental science in the Los Angeles Unified School District.


Over the holiday season California’s Insurance Commissioner, Ricardo Lara, quietly approved a 6.9% rate increase for Mercury Insurance and CSAA Insurance. 
Rate increases for Farmers Insurance Group and the FAIR plan are currently pending. Last year after the Los Angeles fires, State Farm received approval from the insurance commissioner to raise rates by 17% for the average homeowner.
The insurance industry’s most recent wave of rate hikes has been directly encouraged by regulators and politicians from both political parties. Caught in a hostage situation — where the insurance industry threatens to leave the state unless they receive higher rates and less regulation — California’s politicians are forcing the average consumer to pay the ransom, leaving us with an increasingly unaffordable and exploitative insurance market. 
A manufactured crisis 
Climate change has drastically increased the likelihood of destructive wildfires and other climate disasters. Since the catastrophic wildfires of 2017 and 2018, the insurance industry has been gnawing at the bit to upend California’s insurance regulations. 
Insurers took aim while searching for ways to mitigate the costs of repairs and rebuilds associated with climate disasters, without compromising their profit margins and long-term solvency. 
With Lara’s “Sustainable Insurance Strategy” they finally have their chance. At the heart of this strategy is deregulation, a promise of rate approvals and less bureaucracy, in exchange for the insurance industry returning to California and writing new policies in high risk areas again.
Through a coordinated boycott of California, the insurance industry has achieved the crux of what it wanted: public policy and regulation that allows it to pass the cost of the climate crisis off to anyone but themselves. 
By collectively withdrawing from the California market in 2022 and 2023, the insurance industry appeared to have all the leverage. 
Even now, most candidates for insurance commissioner say that unless insurers’ needs and desires are met, they will continue to leave the state, until there is no insurance available for homeowners. Regulators, who cannot see beyond the horizon of a private insurance system, have fallen for this pressure. 
Private insurers also are using internal claim procedures to pay policyholders as little as possible after disasters. Hundreds of fire survivors in Los Angeles have reported that the same insurers demanding rate hikes have yet to adequately compensate them for damages caused by last year’s fires. 
Adjusters are instructed to never put coverage denials in writing and are pressured by management to offer low settlements. Insurers prematurely cut off compensation for survivors whose houses are contaminated with carcinogens, forcing homeowners back into dangerous living situations. Instead of gauging the true degree of contamination in a household, insurers rely on sketchy research, funded and designed by the insurance industry to reach the conclusions insurers desire. 
Although similar stories occur after every major wildfire, regulators usually turn a blind eye, because they are afraid to challenge the power of the insurance industry.
Freeze rates and hold insurers accountable 
Californians must ask themselves: why are ordinary people expected to pick up the tab for the damage and destruction caused by climate change? 
As the saying goes, “If you break it, you buy it.” Those responsible for breaking our climate should be the ones covering the costs of mitigation or repairs associated with climate disasters. The fossil fuel industry, utility companies and their billionaire owners broke our climate and caused these disasters; it’s time they pay to fix it.
As insurance commissioner, I will freeze any further rate hikes. I will lead the department in market conduct investigations of the 10 largest property and casualty insurance companies in California. Investigations will expose the exploitative nature of internal claim procedures, unfair competition or illegal coordination between insurance companies.
That insurance is a commodity sold on the private market and not a right is exactly why we are in this situation. As climate change progresses, disasters become more likely for all of us. We all deserve the right to rebuild. 
Public insurance, not ‘market stabilization’
California already provides a de facto right to home insurance through the FAIR plan for all those who cannot find insurance. Still, the FAIR plan is not a public plan funded by taxpayers for all Californians. 
In 1968, the state of California ordered the private insurance industry to create the FAIR plan as an insurer of last resort, funded based on each insurer’s share of the market. The profits and losses through the FAIR plan are managed by such private insurers as AAA, Farmers, Mercury and others — the same companies who deny policies to begin with. 
Public insurance in California would not be modeled after the FAIR plan.
Without the motive of private insurance, which is structured to deny and limit claims as much as possible, a public insurance plan would allow maximum coverage through a tax on those who are responsible for the climate crisis. California without billionaires could fund a public insurer. 
The insurance crisis cannot be solved by maintaining the current structure of the private insurance industry. A crisis this big needs bold solutions. And I will work alongside every fire survivor and homeowner to make these proposals a reality.

Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration is pressuring local leaders to pass ordinances regulating homeless encampments, among other requirements. 


Gov. Gavin Newsom has threatened many times to withhold state homelessness funds from cities and counties that aren’t doing enough to get people off the streets. 
This year, those threats seem more real than ever. 
Newsom’s administration and the Legislature are adding new strings to that money, which they hope will help address one of the state’s most obvious policy failures: Despite California’s large recent investments in homelessness, encampments are still rampant on city streets. But cities and counties already are chafing under the tightening requirements, which they worry will make it harder to access crucial state funds without directly improving conditions on the street.
To access state Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention money, cities and counties are being pressured to enact a policy regulating homeless encampments that passes state muster – a potential challenge in a state where local jurisdictions’ rules on encampments vary greatly, and many localities have no policy at all. The state also wants localities to get a “prohousing designation” – a special status awarded to places that go above and beyond to build housing. It’s a distinction that only 60 of California’s 541 cities and counties (home to just 15% of the state population) have achieved so far.
Newsom, the Legislature, local officials and other stakeholders likely will spend the next several months fighting about those terms, and hashing out the conditions for the $500 million in homelessness funding proposed in this year’s budget. 
Until those details are resolved, exactly what standard cities and counties will be held to – and what will happen to those that don’t comply – is unclear. But one thing is clear: The state is done freely handing out cash. 
Some counties are already feeling the heat. They report increased scrutiny as they apply for the homelessness funds already approved in the 2024-25 budget (which, thanks to lengthy bureaucratic delays, have just been made available.)
“They’re holding the counties’ feet to the fire,” said Megan Van Sant, senior program manager with the Mendocino County Department of Social Services. 
Newsom’s administration and legislators in favor of the new accountability measures say cities and counties for too long have been scooping up state funds without proving that they’re using them wisely. The new message to locals is clear, said Assemblymember Sharon Quirk-Silva, a Democrat from La Palma in Orange County: “The state has been moving forward, not only with the investment in dollars, but also with legislation. Now it is your time to show that if you want these dollars…you have to show us what you’re doing.”
But the new requirements may make it more burdensome to access crucial homelessness funds.
“I worry that, one, we may leave more cities out,” said Carolyn Coleman, executive director and CEO of the League of California Cities, “and, two, that we may cause delays in the ability to get more people housed sooner, which I think is the goal.”
A tougher application process
Applying for state homelessness funds “absolutely” feels different now than it did last year, and the state is asking tougher questions, said Robert Ratner, director of Santa Cruz County’s Housing for Health program.  
Fortunately, the county just approved an encampment policy in September, and has started working on getting a pro-housing designation, he said. But the state still returned the county’s application with plenty of notes.
“It has felt, at times, like the goal post keeps moving a little bit,” Ratner said.
The county’s application still hasn’t been approved, but it seems to be getting close, Ratner said.
In Mendocino County, the state appears to be holding funds hostage until the county can explain its plans to pass an encampment ordinance, said Van Sant. The county board of supervisors is working on such an ordinance, though it hasn’t come up for a vote yet. 
But the state’s requirement puts Van Sant and her team in an awkward position. As housing administrators, they have no say in any rules the county passes that regulate or prohibit encampments on local streets.
“I wanted to stay out of it,” Van Sant said. “I still want to stay out of it. We’re housing providers. We try to figure out how to provide people housing. We don’t want to weigh in on enforcement. At all.”
This year, the requirements may get even stricter. Under the current rules, the state seems to be satisfied as long as a city or county can show how it plans to get a prohousing designation or pass an encampment policy. In the next round of funding, local leaders worry the state will withhold funds unless cities and counties have actually achieved those benchmarks. 
It’s all about accountability
At issue is the state Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention program, which provides the main source of state money cities and counties use to fight homelessness.
Though Newsom introduced the first round of funding, $650 million, as a “one-time” infusion of cash for local governments in 2019, it became a recurring feature of his administration’s strategy to reduce homelessness over the next five years.
 For four years in a row, the state awarded $1 billion a year to be divvied up between counties, big cities and federally-recognized regional homelessness funding groups known as Continuums of Care. Each round of funding was described as “one-time.” Even so, at least a quarter of the money has gone to day-to-day operating programs, according to data collected by the state.

Last year, things changed. The budget lacked any extra cash for grant funds, and the state’s main homelessness program received no new money. Instead, the Legislature committed to spend $500 million — a 50% reduction from the last round of funding — in the coming fiscal year contingent on “clear accountability requirements.”
Those requirements for localities, spelled out in a follow-up budget bill signed into law last fall, include:

Having a state-approved housing plan, known as a housing element
Having a “Prohousing Designation” from state housing regulators 
Having local encampment policy “consistent with administration guidance”
Ponying up some local funding to match the state contribution
Demonstrating “progress” and “results” on housing and homelessness metrics

These new demands didn’t come out of left field. For several years now, “accountability” has been one of Newsom’s favorite words when discussing homelessness funding. “People have just had it,” he said in 2023. “We want to see these encampments cleaned up.” He has repeatedly threatened to withhold funds, and has gradually ramped up the strings attached to homelessness dollars.
But the current list represents an especially stringent set of requirements for locals hoping for a cut of what has been one of the state’s signature funding sources to combat homelessness.
Quirk-Silva noted that the current list of requirements is not final. She expects the administration to release additional legislative language in February. Legislators will fight over the details through the June budget deadline.
She expected particularly fierce pushback over any kind of “prohousing designation” requirement.
Revoking funds from areas of the state that lack such a designation would be “penalizing service providers for something that is outside of their control,” said Monica Davalos, a policy analyst with the California Budget and Policy Center, a left-leaning think tank. 
San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan wishes the state would focus on more concrete measures of success, such as the number of people housed using state dollars, instead of things like a “prohousing” stamp.

Joe Lombardo enters the 2026 campaign year with more than seven times as much money as his Democratic challengers. (Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)The filing period for politicians hoping to compete in this year’s primary and general election isn’t until March, but matchups in many of the state’s top races are already forming, and the fundraising battles are well underway.
Thursday marked the deadline for candidates filing their annual financial disclosure forms, which list their sources of income, and their annual campaign contributions and expenses report. The reports show most incumbents amassing sizable war chests and provide some insight into what groups and people are supporting which candidates.
At the top of the ticket, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo is running for a second term and entering this election year with approximately $15 million. Meanwhile, his best-funded challenger, Democratic Attorney General Aaron Ford, is starting with $2 million.
According to Lombardo’s contributions and expenses report, his official campaign account has $9 million on hand and raised $4.5 million last year. But his campaign on Wednesday announced that two political action committees affiliated with the governor — Nevada Way and Better Nevada — have a combined $5.9 million on hand after raising $4.7 million in 2025.
The majority of that PAC fundraising — $4.5 million — was done through Nevada Way PAC, according to the PAC’s reports. Top donors to the PAC last year include Station Casinos, Frank Fertitta, and Lorenzo Fertitta. Each gave $1 million. The Fertitta brothers are CEO and board of directors vice chair of the casino company, respectively.
Other resort industry contributions: South Point Hotel and Casino ($200,000), Venetian Las Vegas ($100,000), Boyd Gaming ($100,000) and Caesars Entertainment ($70,000).
One notable donation from the non-gaming world was $250,000 from the Nevadans For Fair Recovery, a PAC affiliated with Uber. The rideshare giant last year was in a battle with trial lawyers over legal liability laws and attorney fee caps. (That effort ended with the Nevada State Legislature passing, and Lombardo signing, a compromise bill.)
The other PAC affiliated with the governor, Better Nevada, raised $266,000 in 2025. All of it from a single source: an Ohio-based dark money outfit called A Public Voice Inc.
Lombardo also has more than $115,000 in his legal defense fund, according to a separate contributions and expenses report filed this week. That account was set up after 2022 Republican gubernatorial primary candidate Joey Gilbert challenged Lombardo’s win. (Lombardo won. Gilbert was ordered to cover Lombardo’s attorney’s fees.) Lombardo later used the fund to defend a legal battle with the Nevada Ethics Commission, which censured him for improperly using his Clark County sheriff’s badge and uniform in campaign materials.
Lombardo’s campaign in a press release Wednesday said he is in “the strongest financial position of any governor in Nevada history at this stage of the cycle.”
For comparison, in January 2022, then-Gov. Steve Sisolak announced he’d raised $4.45 million in 2021 and had $8.28 million on hand. Sisolak would go on to lose his seat that year to Lombardo, whose campaign in early 2022 had $2.6 million on hand.
Ford, who officially launched his campaign in July, raised just under $2 million last year. He has $1.5 million on hand.
Forward Nevada PAC, which is affiliated with Ford, raised an additional $470,000, according to its report.
Ford’s campaign called it “one of the strongest fundraising starts by a gubernatorial challenger in Nevada history.”
As one of the only states where state government control is split between Republicans and Democrats, Nevada’s gubernatorial race is expected to be hotly watched this November.
Before then will  be the June primary. Irina Hansen, a Las Vegas businesswoman who came in ninth in the city’s mayoral primary last year, and Matthew Winterhawk, a conservative who says he fights indoctrination in the public education system, have publicly announced they intend to run against Lombardo in the Republican primary.
Neither candidate had filed a contributions and expenses report as of late Thursday.
Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, Washoe County Commissioner Alexis Hill has also announced her intent to run for governor. Her contributions and expenses report had not been uploaded by late Thursday, but according to her campaign she has raised around $271,000 since September and has $60,000 on hand.
In a video posted to social media earlier in the day, Hill criticized her opponents for bragging about their fundraising totals.
“They think that’s some sort of badge of honor, while real Nevadans are struggling,” she said. “They are more interested in selling out than in actually addressing our severe problems in the state.”
Attorney General
Four candidates have announced their hope to succeed Ford as Nevada attorney general: Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro, State Treasurer Zach Conine, Douglas County Commissioner Danny Tarkanian, and former Cannabis Compliance Board Chair Adriana Guzmán Fralick.
When it comes to their official campaign accounts, about $159,000 separates the two Democrats, Cannizzaro and Conine. About $164,000 separate the two Republicans, Tarkanian and Guzmán Fralick.
Cannizzaro is starting the year with $815,319 on hand; Conine has $656,200.
She raised $645,387 last year. He raised $459,594.
However, Conine’s Let’s Get to Work PAC raised $1 million last year from one donor: Blockchains founder and CEO Jeffrey Berns.
Berns is the millionaire behind a 2021 failed proposal to allow tech companies to form their own governments. Berns has donated to Conine’s PAC in past election cycles, though his previous highest donation was $500,000.
Cannizzaro has at least two affiliated PACs but her campaign did not mention them in their release announcing fundraising totals.
Meanwhile, on the Republican side, Tarkanian reported having $340,529 on hand at the start of the year. Guzmán Fralick reported having $175,823. 
Guzmán Fralick, who announced her candidacy in October, raised $198,719 in the last four months of the year. Tarkanian raised $390,476 across the whole year and out fundraised his primary competitor during the last four months.
In December, Lombardo publicly endorsed Guzmán Fralick, prompting Tarkanian to issue a press release accusing “the deep-state consulting class” of recruiting “a candidate they could control.”
According to her campaign bio, Guzmán Fralick is an attorney who has previously served as legal counsel for a variety of public bodies, including the Public Utilities Commission and Gov. Jim Gibbons, and as a chief deputy district attorney and deputy city manager for Carson City.
Lieutenant governor
Nevada’s tightest fundraising race appears to be in the only state constitutional office that is a part time job: lieutenant governor.
Only around $6,600 separate the campaign accounts of the incumbent, Republican Lt. Gov. Stavros Anthony, and his Democratic challenger, state Assembly Majority Leader Sandra Jauregui.
Anthony, who is running for a second term, reported having $232,026 going into the new year. Jauregui reported having $225,390.
Anthony’s top donors are MGM Resorts and Zuffa, the parent company of UFC. Jauregui’s include various local and national PACs associated with Democrats.
Zuffa also donated to Jauregui, though only $7,500 compared to $10,000 for Anthony.
Jauregui in October announced she would run for lieutenant governor. Before that, she announced she would not seek reelection for the Assembly seat she has held since 2016.
Jauregui, who survived the 1 October mass shooting in 2017, is known for her legislative work on gun control. More recently, in the 2025 regular legislative session and the 2025 special session, she championed a massive expansion of the state’s film tax credit program. That effort failed in both sessions.
A PAC affiliated with Laborers’ International Union of North America, better known as LIUNA, donated $10,000 to Jauregui’s campaign last month.
Anthony and Jauregui may appear on the ballot along with what’s become the former’s signature issue: banning transgender athletes in the state from competing in leagues and competitions that don’t match the gender they were assigned at birth. Lombardo announced he would be backing a proposed constitutional amendment targeting trans athletes.
Anthony has become an outspoken opponent of trans athletes, forming in the lieutenant governor’s office a “Task Force to Protect Women in Sports.”
Treasurer
The Nevada State Treasurer is an open race, as Democratic incumbent Zach Conine runs for attorney general.
Democratic Assemblymember Joe Dalia and Republican Drew Johnson, a former policy analyst who has focused on government spending and waste, are seeking the office.
Dalia, who is serving his first term in the state Assembly, reported going into the new year with $170,779. He raised a little more than that in 2025. 
His top contributors include a national nonprofit Write the World LLC, failed 2024 independent Congressional District 2 candidate Greg Kidd, and Democratic controller candidate Michael MacDougall. Each donated $10,000.
Johnson reported having $47,505 on hand. His top contributor was Marnell Gaming Management, which focuses on tribal casinos.
In 2024, Johnson ran for Nevada’s 3rd Congressional District, where he emerged victorious out of a crowded primary but lost to Democratic incumbent  U.S. Rep. Susie Lee. In the election cycle before that, in 2022, he narrowly lost to incumbent Clark County Commissioner Justin Jones.
Secretary of State
Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar is the only Democratic incumbent running for reelection in a statewide race. Democratic Attorney General Aaron Ford and Treasurer Zach Conine are both seeking higher office.
Aguilar reported having $543,137 for his re-election campaign going into 2026. He raised $389,563 last year.
Republican Sharron Angle has announced she intends to challenge Aguilar. In 2024, Angle ran for Nevada State Senate District 15, which covers part of Reno. She lost in the Republican primary to Michael Ginsburg, who would go on to lose to Democrat Angie Taylor.
Angle had not filed a campaign finance report as of late Thursday.
Controller
Nevada State Controller Andy Matthews, a Republican, started the new year off with $254,115 — $153,613 of which he raised last year.
That means the incumbent has a significant head start over Democrat Michael MacDougall, the only other person who’s announced he intends to run for the office.
MacDougall, a local high school teacher who announced he was running in early December, reported having $20,389. The vast majority of that came from two donors who share his last name.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)As Utah lawmakers return to Capitol Hill for their 2026 session next week, LGBTQ+ advocates are on guard for what will be the fifth year in a row with multiple bills targeting transgender people.
But one bill in particular — HB183 — stands out as especially bad, said Marina Lowe, policy director for Utah’s largest LGBTQ+ advocacy group, Equality Utah. 
“That is by far the most harmful and outrageous piece of legislation I have seen in a long time,” Lowe told Utah News Dispatch in an interview this week. 
The bill — sponsored by one of Utah’s most hard-right Republicans, Rep. Trevor Lee, of Layton — is far reaching and would have broad impacts in a variety of areas of state code. The bill would: 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX

Strip out the word “gender” and replace it with “sex” in many areas of state law, including in the state’s anti-discrimination protections for housing, employment and crime victims. 
Ban changes to the sex designation field of a birth certificate.
Require state agencies when making administrative rules to refer to “biological sex” by using the term sex instead of gender.
Ban school districts and certain providers licensed by the Department of Health and Human Services from assigning a transgender employee to a role that interacts with children. 
In child custody proceedings, require a court to view a parent’s non-support of a transgender child’s gender identity as a “factor to favor awarding custody to that parent.” 
Remove “gender identity” from a provision that allows the Utah Division of Motor Vehicles to refuse personalized license plates that disparage a list of groups (which also currently includes race, religion, sexual orientation, ect).

To sum up the bill’s impacts, Lowe said it would “green light, by way of state law, the ability to commit hate crimes against the transgender community, to discriminate against the transgender community.” She said it would remove protections for transgender people for employment or housing.
Lowe argues the bill also “undermines parental rights in ways that are harmful for the trans community,” and requires discriminating against transgender people in jobs that are licensed by the Utah Department of Health and Human services, which is a “huge list of different entities.” 
“That’s hospitals, foster care, adoption agencies, substance use, mental health facilities, youth residential,” she said.
Another provision “basically allows for discrimination” against transgender people, Lowe said, by banning them from working in schools as teachers, staff members, counselors, or “any circumstance where they would come face to face with a student for longer than five minutes.”
The bill would effectively “erase transgender people from existence under state law,” she said — except in one provision, which “allows you to disparage transgender people on license plates.” 
Lee told Utah News Dispatch in an interview this week that his bill is aimed at “getting away from this idea that there are like 100 different genders out there.”

“There is no such thing as gender, it’s a made up word and term. It’s actually just two sexes. There’s male and female,” he said. “We need to get back to that basic biology.” 
He said he also wants “no more changing birth certificates” because “that’s stupid and it makes it very confusing for people, as we get older, especially our children.” 
Lowe said it’s one of the most egregious legislative attacks on transgender people she’s ever seen crop up on Utah’s Capitol Hill because it would basically undo years of progress to create equal protections for a class of people that do exist — whether Lee likes it or not. 
Among the most high-profile pieces of legislation that Lee’s bill would impact is a 2015 law, SB296, which ​​banned sexual orientation and gender identity-based discrimination in housing and hiring while also providing safeguards for religious freedom. The law is known as the “Utah Compromise” because The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and LGBTQ+ advocates all backed the bill. 
“Trevor Lee’s bill takes a sledgehammer not just to the compromise, but to each and every one of the legislative solutions that have emerged over the past decade where Equality Utah and largely Republican lawmakers have come together to try and solve really complex, challenging, difficult issues, in particular facing the LGBTQ community,” Lowe said. 
Lee refused to acknowledge that his bill would allow discrimination against transgender people in housing and employment, instead insisting that they don’t exist. 
“You’ve got to pick one. You’re not both. See, this is part of getting away from this complete, alternate universe that people have been living in for a long time,” he said. “There’s male and female. There’s nothing in between. It doesn’t happen.” 
Lowe said “it’s hard to land on any other conclusion that this is just a really cruel bill.”

“I really hope our other lawmakers will feel some of the fatigue around this issue,” she said. “This is now, gosh, the fifth straight year in a row that we’ve seen multiple bills targeting this very small and pretty vulnerable community.” 
Lowe said she hopes the rest of the Republican-controlled Legislature “decides against taking this approach, which really doesn’t improve anybody’s lives, it doesn’t solve any problems, it just leaves a vulnerable group considerably more vulnerable.” 
One of Utah’s most powerful legislative leaders, Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, was one of three Republican sponsors of the 2015 “Utah Compromise” enacting LGBTQ+ protections while balancing religious freedom provisions. 
Asked about Lee’s HB183 during a wide-ranging interview this week, Adams — who rarely takes positions on House bills before they’ve progressed to the Senate — told Utah News Dispatch “it would take a lot to convince me” to make any changes to the anti-discrimination code enacted by the 2015 law. 
He noted that there’s a “nonseverability clause” in the law, which means that if “any portion is struck down by a court, that the entire bill would be struck down.” Legislative changes may not impact that provision, he said, but he still expressed concerns about changing the law. 
“There were a lot of commitments made, and it was artfully crafted and balanced,” he said. “I would be very, very hesitant to try to undo that balance.” 
Adams also expressed frustration with what he called “social issue” bills, which he said can be “distracting” from the important and “exciting” things Utah lawmakers hope to focus on this year when it comes to energy development, critical minerals, water, housing and other big issues that have sweeping impact in the state.
That may spell trouble for Lee’s bill, at least in the Senate. But it’s too early to tell how far the bill — or some version of it — will progress. The 2026 Legislative Session is scheduled to begin Tuesday, and will last 45 days. It also comes during an election year, when 15 Senate seats and 75 House seats are up for election.

Lee, when asked about the Senate president’s comments, said, “Yeah, well, times change.” 
“You would have never asked me 10 years ago if we had to worry about keeping biological males out of female sports,” he said. “Things happen. We have issues. We have problems. … If Utah, in my opinion, made a mistake in 2015 by giving an identity to something that doesn’t exist, I think that’s very problematic to everyone.” 
Lee also argued anti-transgender legislation is worth spending time on because he said “these social issues have a much wider impact on our state.” 
“Whether (Adams) wants to talk about them or not, these are serious problems that we deal with, and we run significant legislation around these social issues,” Lee said. “He knows that, and it’s unfortunate we have to deal with them, but we do. It’s just the world we live in now.” 
Lee added that “just like him, I wish we didn’t have to run these kinds of bills.” 
“I wish everyone had common sense like we all used to agree on with this stuff, but because we don’t,” he said. “We need to bring back common sense for society, not for our sake but for our children’s sake, too. So they grow up in a world that’s not wrought with confusion and identity-type politics.” 
Lee continued: “This needs to be squashed, needs to be taken out of the way, and we need to go back to common sense and the things that made Utah great, not things that made California a terrible place to live in this country with their types of politics. We want to protect ourselves from that. And that’s what these bills are doing, it’s making us go as far away from those blue-type states’ policies as possible.” 
Renaming Harvey Milk Boulevard after Charlie Kirk
Though Lowe said HB183 is by far the worst anti-transgender bill filed so far this year, Equality Utah is also opposing several other bills.
Another one sponsored by Lee, HB196, has especially sparked anger from Salt Lake City leaders and residents. That bill would rename 900 South in Salt Lake City — currently known as Harvey Milk Boulevard, named after the early LGBTQ+ rights leader and the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California. Milk was assassinated in San Francisco in 1978. 
Lee wants to rename that street Charlie Kirk Boulevard, after the conservative influencer who was shot and killed last year during a speaking event in front of thousands of students at Utah Valley University in Orem.

Equality Utah and Salt Lake City leaders have opposed it as not only an attack on an LGBTQ+ icon, but also infringing on local control. Currently, cities have the power to name their roads.
“Trevor Lee has an unusual, and truly bizarre obsession with the LGBT community,” Lowe and Equality Utah’s executive director, Troy Williams, wrote in a statement condemning HB196. “And it’s so curious that he wants to memorialize Charlie Kirk on the absolute gayest street in Utah.” 
Williams and Lowe added that Salt Lake City residents “know the difference between meaningful leadership and culture-war cosplay.” 
“Harvey Milk earned his place in history,” they said. “Trevor Lee, despite his yearning for our attention, isn’t destined for the history books. Frankly, he couldn’t even land his name on a cul-de-sac.” 
They said that if a conservative city wants to “memorialize Charlie Kirk, where he will be truly celebrated, then that is absolutely their prerogative.” 
“We are not going to pit Charlie against Harvey,” Lowe and Williams said. “These two men, if still alive today, would enjoy sitting down together, and engaging in spirited and friendly debate about the issues of the day.” 
When asked why Lee is targeting 900 South rather than naming a street in another city, like in Orem, after Kirk, Lee told Utah News Dispatch: “What a better street to pick than the one from the group of people who don’t seem to understand how to have a civil dialogue.” 
“Charlie Kirk was the best of us,” Lee said. “He was a man of faith, he walked the walk, he was someone who wanted to engage in civil dialogue with those who disagreed with him.”
Lee also accused Milk of being a “pedophile,” and said that it’s “embarrassing for our state, that we have a street named after him.”

Lee’s comments echo accusations against Milk that have circulated for years, stemming from a biography that says Milk was involved with a teenage boy who was 16 years old when they met in New York City in 1964, when Milk was 33. Milk was never convicted of sexual misconduct.
Those accusations against Milk resurfaced most recently after Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth ordered the secretary of the Navy to rename the oiler ship USNS Harvey Milk in June. 
The ship was first named after Milk in 2016 by then-Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, according to Military.com. Milk came from a family that had a history of naval service, and he also served in the Navy during the Korean War. He left the service in 1955 with a “less than honorable” discharge “after being officially questioned about his sexual orientation,” according to his official biography. 
Lowe dismissed Lee’s bill as “a petty move” that is “intended simply to stoke agitation and to get more likes on Twitter.” 
Lowe also disputed Lee’s claims about Milk and whether it has anything to do with renaming a street in Salt Lake City after Charlie Kirk. “If we wanted to look back into the history about inappropriate relationships between adults and underage individuals, there are plenty in this state we could talk about as well,” she said.

Renaming the street is “not a serious policy issue,” she said. “I hope other lawmakers view it as such.” 
“We just don’t view it as a serious proposal,” she said. “Lawmakers have such a limited time on Capitol Hill to really tackle the complicated and challenging issues facing our state, and to be wasting time trying to remove one street name and replace it with another, simply to stick it to the libs, seems like a tremendous waste of time.” 
Other anti-LGBTQ+ bills
In addition to Lee’s bills, there are several other anti-LGBTQ+ bills. Some were unsuccessful in past legislative sessions, but their sponsors have revived them in attempts to get them passed in 2026.
They include: 

HB193, sponsored by Rep. Nicholeen Peck, R-Tooele, which would ban public funding for transgender-affirming medical care. 
HB95, also sponsored by Peck, which would prohibit consequences against a public employee, including teachers, who refuse to recognize someone’s gender identity. 
HB174, sponsored by Rep. Rex Shipp, R-Cedar City, to require health care professionals currently providing cross-sex hormones or puberty blockers to transgender minors to taper their patients off the treatment. Utah lawmakers in 2023 enacted an indefinite moratorium on new prescriptions for puberty blockers and hormone therapy to minors. Lowe said she also expects an effort to convert that moratorium into a ban. 
HB114, sponsored by Rep. Colin Jack, R-St. George, would restrict drag shows and criminalize performing them in a public space or in the presence of a minor. 

Lowe said to see another year of anti-transgender bills surfacing on Utah’s Capitol Hill is demoralizing and exhausting for a vulnerable group of people who are already feeling marginalized and bullied by the Utah Legislature. 
“It’s got to feel just terrible for the transgender community to sort of wait with bated breath every January to see what’s coming, and to see so many bills come out before the session has even started is kind of demoralizing,” she said. 
After so many years of anti-transgender legislation, “it feels like there’s nothing else that can be legislated, and yet every year they seem to come back to the same issue area,” she said. 
“These are people’s lives,” she said. “I guess my question to the Legislature would be, you know, trans people still exist, even after all of these bills get passed. And what is the Legislature doing to support these families? They’re not going away. They still need help and resources.”

The APLS Board voted to continue denying state funds to Fairhope Public Library and declared ten books in its teen section, including Margaret Atwood's ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" were sexually explicit and needed to be removed. (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Public Library Service Thursday said that Fairhope Public Library remains out of compliance with the administrative code and will continue to withhold state aid until the library is back in compliance.
The library must remove at least 10 books from a section for teenagers that the Fairhope Library Board voted to keep there, including “The Handmaid’s Tale” by Margaret Atwood; “The Hate U Give” by Angie Thomas and “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” by Stephen Chbosky.
“This is the right decision,” said John Wahl, chair of the Alabama Public Library Service and the Alabama Republican Party.
The move drew criticism from board member Ronald Snider, who has been critical of APLS’ increasingly restrictive policies.
“You are becoming the censor-in-chief of Alabama,” Snider said to Wahl.  “You are substituting your judgement over the overall benefit of many of these books.”
The board, which last year delayed restoration of Fairhope’s money in order to review the books, declared all 10 sexually explicit in violation of recent amendments to the state library code. Several board members based their votes entirely on a report from Wahl about the books, which first tallied the frequency of specific curse words, racial slurs and sexual words contained within the books.
Wahl then excerpted passages from the titles, and within each of them, highlighted specific sections that he said contained sexually explicit content that violates the APLS administrative code, such as an intimate scene in “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” by Stephen Chbosky and three passages in “The Handmaid’s Tale” describing sex.



Titles that APLS voted as sexually explicit


“The Perks of Being a Wallflower” by Stephen Chbosky
“Beyond Magenta” by Susan Kuklin
“The Handmaid’s Tale” by Margaret Atwood
“Crank” by Ellen Hopkins
“Identical” by Ellen Hopkins
“Shine” by Lauren Myracle
“Sold” by Patricia McCormick
“The Hate U Give” by Angie Thomas
“Doing It” by Hannah Witton




“They contain parts that I would not want my child to read before I explain to them the content,” Wahl said. “I have that concern, and it is perfectly legitimate for parents across the state to also have that concern.”
Throughout the discussion, Wahl asked Fairhope to defend its decision to retain the books in the teens’ section of their library. Snider accused Wahl of ambushing Fairhope officials by not providing them a copy of the report ahead of time.
Randal Wright, chair of the Fairhope Public Library, told APLS board members that the library does not allow minors access to sexually explicit materials without permission from their parents. The library has a system that allows parents to choose particular library cards for their children that allows them access to specific sections in the library, along with specific books that they may check out.
“As a whole, I did not think there was a reason that these books should be moved,” Wright said.
Wright said that it is also the parents’ responsibility to oversee the content that their children read.
“Parents make those decisions, and if you, as a parent, do not like this book, then your child doesn’t read,” Wright said. “But you can’t keep that book away from my child.”
Wahl disagreed, and that parents cannot watch their children at every moment they are in the library.
“If a mother comes in, she has two, three, maybe four kids, she cannot necessarily police every single one of her children on what they are looking at in a minor’s section,” Wahl said. “She cannot be expected to.”
APLS will continue to withhold the first $11,000 allotment that Fairhope was supposed to receive in December, along with future quarterly payments it has been allocated for the current fiscal year. To regain its state aid, Fairhope must move the remaining 10 books that people said should be reshelved.
APLS board members first voted to suspend state aid for Fairhope in March 2025 after they fielded complaints from a few area residents who visited the library and complained that they found library materials in the teens’ section that violated an updated APLS administrative code adopted in the summer of 2024 that required libraries adopt policies to restrict minors from having access to specific materials.
The board updated the administrative code  in November to further restrict minors from having access to library materials that include “gender ideology, which it did not define.
Fairhope library has received an outpouring of support and received $42,000 from two nonprofits from donations they solicited on their behalf to help offset the remaining funding that the library forfeited in 2025 because they continued to be out of compliance with the administrative code.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20260115_132213-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-16 08:57:49.636586

“It does not change election results. It only checks them or the post audit of the machines at random,” Lovvorn said on the House floor Thursday.
The Legislative Fiscal Office says that an audit would cost $35,000 per day. 
House Democrats debated the bill for hours, questioning its expense and necessity and saying it could undermine faith in elections.
“We want to make sure that they can trust the system, because there’s so much advocacy now against the system, that it’s rigged and all that,” Rep. Thomas Jackson, D-Demopolis said Thursday. “But I have never found that to be the case here. And when you use those boring languages like that, you put a distrust in the people.”
During the 2025 legislative session former Rep. Debbie Wood, R-Valley, filed a similar bill that passed the House but did not come to a vote in the Senate. 
Election fraud is extremely rare in Alabama. According to the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, there have been 41 convictions for or findings of voting fraud in the state since 2000. By comparison, over 2.2 million votes were cast in the 2024 presidential election in Alabama. 
Rep. Barbara Drummond, D-Mobile, said Thursday the money appropriated in the bill could be better spent.
“It may not be a lot of money, but to some places, the amount of money that is going to cost the state, I just kind of feel like we could use that in a better purpose,” she said.
Drummond also said doing an audit before an election could result in ensuring the voting precincts and machines are in accordance with guidelines.
Another legislator, Rep. Pebblin Warren, D-Tuskegee, argued that the state should be focusing more on mental health than post-election audits.
“Our first priority needs to be mental illness. If we can put $2 million on an election and allow as many people as we have in Alabama walking around the street mentally ill and not taking care of that issue. I think our priorities are out of order,” she said.
When asked by House Democrats if he had data to support the claim of discrepancy in Alabama elections, Lovvorn cited a pilot program.
“We’re using machines to run our elections, right then we just need to make sure working for your voters, my voters, so we can look and tell them we’re doing everything we can within reason,”
According to the Alabama Secretary of State website, a 2021 act passed in the state allowed a post-election audit to be conducted in Dallas, Houston and Marshall counties after the 2022 general election. Lovvorn said this program found one discrepancy but didn’t show what the error was.
Rep. Mary Moore, D-Birmingham, said without specific examples of voter fraud and election discrepancies, the bill isn’t needed.
“This is a frivolous bill. Even with your pilot program, you only came up with one incident. That’s not sufficient,” she said on the House floor.
Rep. Rick Rehm, R-Dothan, supported the bill.
“We have an issue in which our constituents, and it’s not just in Alabama, all across this country, are losing confidence in our elections,” Rehm said on the House floor.
Rep. A.J. McCampbell, D-Linden, offered an amendment to the bill that would have implemented a lottery-like system to ensure the random selection of precincts and voting machines. 
“If it’s going to be a random process, make it truly random. Don’t allow the subjectivity to creep into it. That’s all I’ve complained about,” he said after the House adjourned.
The House rejected the amendment on a 73-29 vote, mostly on party lines. 
House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, said after the meeting the bill will add integrity to the state’s election process.
“Anytime you get integrity to the people’s election, when they know that it’s safe and secure and they know that the machine is going to run properly, it’s a good day,” he said.

Brenda Shields, pictured presenting her child care tax credit legislation in a January 2024 House hearing, is hoping to expand gifted education in a bill heard by the House Education committee Thursday. Shields, a Republican from St. Joseph, estimates that 20,000 gifted students in Missouri are not receiving specialized classes to meet their needs (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).More Missouri public school students could receive gifted education under two proposals debated by the House Education Committee Thursday.
State Rep. Brenda Shields, a Republican from St. Joseph, is sponsoring a bill that would require schools to screen all students to determine if they qualify as gifted before they reach third grade.
She estimates that there are 20,000 Missouri students that are gifted but not currently enrolled in specialized classes.
The bill expands on a state law that requires schools to offer gifted education when at least 3% of their student body is identified as gifted. This requirement began last school year.
“If screenings don’t happen, gifted and talented students aren’t identified,” she told the committee. “If the students are not identified, schools will never reach the 3% threshold to be able to offer a gifted program.”
Gifted students can present as squirrely or distracted in the classroom, Shields said, with thoughts and ideas beyond the basic curriculum. Providing a more enriching education will help both the students and their teacher, she said.

Beth Winton, chair of the Advisory Council on the Education of Gifted and Talented Children, agreed that many gifted students “are not always a pleasure to have in class.”
“The standard grade level curriculum is not designed to meet their academic or emotional needs,” she said. “And regular teachers already have enough demands on their time.”
Committee members largely spoke in favor of the bill, sharing personal anecdotes of their experiences in the classroom as teachers, parents and former students.
State Rep. Ann Kelley, a Republican from Lamar, said gifted education provides a needed challenge for some kids. Kelley, who taught eighth-grade English, said she saw students who were never identified as gifted but could benefit from the program.
“By (eighth grade), they don’t really test very many students at that point. And if they’ve been missed in that window, they’ve already checked out,” she said.
The largest concern came from state Rep. Mark Boyko, a Democrat from Kirkwood, who wondered if requiring schools to start screening by this fall is too tight of a timeline.
“As someone who has been on school boards, I know that drafting a good policy for a district is a process that takes a number of months,” he said. “So I have concerns that the bill starts one school year too early.”
Bolstering Shields’ legislation, a bill by state Rep. Scott Miller would ensure districts have the resources to educate gifted students by adding a line to the formula that determines state aid for public schools.
“High-quality gifted programming often includes advanced curriculum, specialized instructional strategies, social-emotional supports with trained educators and individualized learning pathways,” Miller, a St. Charles Republican, told the committee. “These services require additional staffing, materials and professional infrastructure, all of which come at a greater cost than general education alone.”
His bill would fund gifted students 60% higher than the base per-pupil amount. Based on the state’s current per-pupil funding, this means schools would receive an additional $4,287 per gifted student.
This number may decrease if the bill moves along in the legislative process. The committee’s chair, state Rep. Ed Lewis, a Moberly Republican, told Miller the multiplier was “pretty high.”
The bill’s fiscal note estimates it would have an annual cost of nearly $121.5 million, though Miller questioned the accuracy of the estimate. 
Lobbyists for education groups such as the Missouri State Teachers Association and the Missouri Association of School Administrators spoke in favor of the funding boost.
“(The state) really does need to have a component in the formula to support gifted students,” said Otto Fajen, lobbyist for teachers union Missouri National Education Association. “That is critical.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-16 13:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Spending cap will allow most CT budget growth in a decade,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/16/ct-spending-cap-grows/,It remains unclear whether a 5.93% increase in spending will cover growing needs in core programs — or offset vanishing federal aid.,"Connecticut legislators will have more room to spend under state budget caps later this year than they’ve enjoyed in more than a decade.
But it remains unclear whether that will permit enough spending to cover growing needs in health care, education, and other core programs — or to offset vanishing federal aid.
New revenue projections released Thursday from Gov. Ned Lamont’s budget staff and the legislature’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis showed little change in projected tax receipts for this fiscal year and next.
But the consensus forecast is based on household income growth in Connecticut that has averaged 5.93% annually over the past five years. And because of that surge, state budget appropriations, with a few exceptions, can grow by that same 5.93%, which translates into an extra $1.3 billion next fiscal year, which starts July 1.
Connecticut’s primary budget cap allows growth equal to the latest five-year average increase in household income, or to the prior year’s inflation, whichever is larger. Principal and interest payments on bonded debt, spending to meet court orders and new federal mandates are cap exempt. All remaining segments of the total budget, about 80% of a plan expected to top $28.6 billion next fiscal year, must share the allowable $1.3 billion growth.
At first glance, that seems great.
Allowable budget growth has averaged about $700 million over the past five years and rarely tops $1 billion, though it is set to exceed $980 billion this fiscal year.
And the percentage growth has only topped 5% three other times since 2017.
But most years, spending cap growth isn’t sufficient to cover all inflationary cost hikes faced by state agencies and programs. And in some cases, such as state funding for nursing homes, inflationary hikes required by statute have been suspended for more than a decade.
The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities launched an ad campaign last year charging that education grants to communities, once adjusted for inflation, had declined by more than $400 million. The legislature and Lamont responded last spring by boosting education aid by more than $130 million this fiscal year.
And the community-based nonprofits that deliver the bulk of state-sponsored social services insist they lose hundreds of millions annually because state payments haven’t kept pace with inflation for more than a decade.
Rep. Toni E. Walker, D-New Haven, co-chairwoman of the legislature’s Appropriations Committee, said “we’ve got some big-ticket items” to address in the next fiscal year.
Besides providing some inflationary adjustments, legislators hope to further expand investments in education aid, affordable child care and housing while bolstering understaffed state agencies.
The budget committee’s other co-chairwoman, Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, said last year’s investments in education, though significant, weren’t sufficient to ease pressure on municipal property taxpayers, who still cover far too much of the cost of K-12 education.
“We’re far behind where we should be,” she said.
Walker and Osten also noted that Connecticut expects to lose hundreds of millions in federal aid or more next fiscal year for human services programs, and many lawmakers want to see increased state spending to mitigate painful cuts to health care, nutrition assistance and other services.
But Rep. Tammy Nuccio of Tolland, ranking House Republican on the Appropriations Committee, said majority Democrats in the General Assembly must get better about accepting cap limitations and prioritizing spending.
“I think it’s funny there’s never enough of other people’s money to spend,” she said. “That’s the sad truth.”
Nuccio added that her caucus also will be pushing to control spending to allow for a major state income tax cut that House GOP members called for in the fall. The caucus wants to deliver a much as $700 extra to middle-income households by expanding an income tax credit that offsets a portion of municipal property tax costs.
Lamont, a fiscally moderate Democrat, also has pressed his fellow Democrats to live within the spending cap.
That metric “reflects our residents’ ability to pay,” Chris Collibee, Lamont’s budget spokesman, said.
Collibee also cautioned legislators about planning for too much new spending, noting that the nearly $1.3 billion in new spending allowed by the cap “will be needed to maintain current services during the coming fiscal year.”
Revenue growth is modest after surging for more than a year
State revenues, which already have grown considerably over the past year, remained largely stable in analysts’ latest projections.
Thursday’s report estimated tax receipts and other resources for the General Fund, which covers the bulk of state budget operating expenses, would approach $24.5 billion this fiscal year, up about $100 million from their latest projection in early November.  And they also upgraded revenue estimates for the next fiscal year by about $80 million.
In both cases, robust sales tax trends drove most of the growth, which nonetheless represents only a fraction of 1% of the General Fund.
“Today’s consensus revenue forecast reaffirms what we’ve been saying all along — Connecticut’s economy is resilient,” Lamont said. “Despite international and national economic uncertainty, our state continues to demonstrate strength and stability.”
The governor, who must propose his next state budget to the legislature on Feb. 4, added Thursday that “my top priority remains making Connecticut more affordable for middle-class and working-class families. We will keep investing in policies that lower costs, create good-paying jobs, and ensure that families and businesses can grow and thrive here.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0107_SR_CapitolMugs_057-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-16 08:57:49.636586

(PRNewsfoto/GTL)State lawmakers and justice reform groups are questioning the associated costs and services available on tablets offered to those incarcerated at correction facilities. 
Assembly Bill 35, passed nearly unanimously during the 2023 legislative session, authorized those incarcerated within Nevada Department of Corrections facilities to have telecommunications such as tablets. 
Proponents of the bill said access would enable people in state prisons the ability to stay in contact with family members, access medical care quicker, obtain educational training, apply for resources ahead of release, and even access entertainment.
Only inmates at two facilities, Jean Conservation Camp and Carlin Conservation Camp, don’t have access to tablets, NDOC prisons director James Dzurenda told the legislative Interim Judiciary Committee on Tuesday. 
The costs to communicate and access services have been higher than expected, said Nick Shepack, the Nevada state director of the Fines and Fees Justice Center. 
“There was a promise that there was going to be items that cost, and there were also going to be items that were supposed to be super beneficial, but came at no cost,” Shepack said in an interview with Nevada Current. “What we’ve seen is exactly what I feared, which is they rolled out all the extremely expensive stuff and everything else is coming eventually.” 
One of the points of contention was the service charge to put money on the tablets that varies depending on how much is loaded.  
While groups were aware during the contract process that there would be a service charge for the tablets, they are still hoping state officials will step in to offer some sort of solutions to address those costs. 
Shepack said the charge creates a system where families with lower incomes who might only add $10 for a loved one incarcerated would pay an additional $5 service charge. 
“The minimum you can put on is $10,” he said, adding the people who are likely to add that amount are “living paycheck to paycheck like that, not even able to make ends meet.”
State lawmakers, at the behest of groups like the prisoner advocacy group Return Strong and the Fines and Fees Justice Center, have capped other punitive prices such as high markups of commissary items and health care. 
Shepack worried the tablets will create a new avenue to generate money off the backs of those incarcerated. 
“We’re at a point where lockdowns are at an all time high,” Shepack said. “That means more time in their cells … of course, people are going to lean on these tablets to not go crazy while locked in their cell. And the prices they’re charging them are just extremely exploitative.”
Dzurenda attributed some of the higher costs, such as rates to make phone calls, to unforeseen changes from the Federal Communications Commissions, including the commission rolling back regulations adopted under President Joe Biden that placed caps on the cost of phone calls.  
The rate was limited to 6 cents a minute in 2024. The FCC increased the limit to 10 cents a minute for larger prisons – 12 cents per minute for medium prisons – under President Donald Trump. 
“That’s where the phone call adjustments came up,” Dzurenda said. “It was based on the FCC ruling and not based on us.”
He added the department is expecting additional changes and regulations from the FCC later this spring. 
The department is also expected to receive a share of revenue collected from ViaPath, the telecommunications company contracted by NDOC to administer the services. However, Dzurenda said they weren’t sure how much revenue is expected or when it is supposed to be made available, adding it “was not spelled out” in the contract approved by the state. 
“We are still estimating and guessing at what that revenue is going to look like,” he added.
Democratic Assemblymember Brittney Miller, who is co-chair of the committee, was concerned that there wasn’t any idea what the revenue would be.
“We don’t know if that check is going to be $17 or $17,000,” she said. “I’m just concerned that, or perplexed, that was a part of the agreement during this entire RFP (request for proposal) and contractual development.” 
State Sen. Rochelle Nguyen also questioned the disconnect between the contract NDOC sought from ViaPath and what was ultimately approved by state agencies. She added it seemed like there were cheaper services NDOC sought that weren’t included in the final contract approved. 
Tablets currently offer a variety of services such as the ability to write emails, access to religious services, and streaming entertainment – though the cost to stream movies and music at 5 cents a minute is another point of contention among justice reform groups.
Other services like access to medical care or the ability for those incarcerated to submit grievances still aren’t available. 
Dzurenda said some of these services cost NDOC money but the department won’t know how much until it sees its revenue share from ViaPath.
NDOC, he added, is also having difficulty providing people with medical services via tablet because medical records can’t currently be accessed electronically. 
“We do not have access to electronic medical records, and none of this can go through the electronic system,” he said. 
Other services, like giving people the ability to file “grievances” for problems happening in the prisons, would require an update to the Offender Management System, Dzurenda said. He didn’t offer any details about the costs and process of updating the system. 
NDOC is also looking at other additions to the tablet including partnering with the Clark County Library District to offer GED courses on the tablet and adding word processing, which he said would help people with legal filings.  
He said he would want to include other services “that I know will be beneficial with programming,” he said, adding “It costs money.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GTL_Inspire_2_0-1024x445.jpg,,,2026-01-16 07:56:49.091181

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced the start of the investigation in December, noting that her department intends to identify, document, investigate, and prosecute instances where criminal acts may have occurred at these facilities. 
“My office is committed to ensuring that survivors’ voices are heard and that any criminal acts uncovered are thoroughly investigated and, when possible, prosecuted,” Nessel said in a statement.
Historical context
According to the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition, there were more than 526 government-funded and often church-run boarding schools across the United States in the 19th and 20th centuries, where Indigenous children were forcibly relocated; stripped of their traditional clothing, hair and personal belongings, and were beaten, starved or otherwise abused for speaking their Native language or acting in any way that might represent their traditional or cultural practices. 
The goal of these schools was to forcibly assimilate children into white American culture in an effort to dispossess tribal nations of their land.
Indian-Boarding-Schools-in-the-United-States-6
 
The coalition has identified eight facilities in Michigan as part of its ongoing research. This includes St. Joseph Orphanage in Assinins, Baraga Chippewa Boarding and Day School, Catholic Otchippewa Boarding School in Schoolcraft County, Holy Childhood of Jesus School in Harbor Springs, Holy Family Orphanage in Marquette, Mackinac Mission School on Mackinac Island, Mount Pleasant Indian Industrial Boarding School and New Mission House in Omena. 
Survivor voices and accountability
As part of its investigation, the Michigan Department of Attorney General is looking to speak with survivors, witnesses and individuals with firsthand knowledge about criminal acts that occurred at these institutions. They’ve encouraged individuals with information to reach out through email at AG-NBSInvestigation@michigan.gov or to call the investigation’s tipline at 517-897-7391, where tips can be left anonymously.
While criminal charges can be pursued if there is sufficient evidence, the department notes that prosecution may not always be an option if an offender has died, a living victim is unable to participate in the legal process or the statute of limitations has expired. However, the department has also committed  to memorializing the result of its investigation in a report that will be released to the public, while honoring culture and privacy.
Pain and resilience: The legacy of Native American boarding schools in Michigan

Nessel’s criminal investigation follows an initiative brought forth by then-Secretary of Interior Deb Haaland under former President Joe Biden’s administration working to provide a comprehensive review of the federal government’s Indian boarding school policies intended to eliminate Native American cultures through the forced removal and assimilation of Indigenous children.
In addition to identifying the names of boarding school facilities and sites, the initiative sought to identify the names and Tribal identities of children who were placed in these schools, identify the locations of marked and unmarked burial sites of children near these facilities and to collect Tribal and individual viewpoints on their experiences and the impacts of the Federal Indian Boarding School system.
Academic and community perspectives
In an interview with Michigan Advance, Tyler Dettloff, the director of the Center for Native American Studies at Northern Michigan University, said Nessel’s investigation could help provide justice for the families of individuals who attended these boarding schools.
The investigation also resonates with coursework at the university, Dettloff said, with Northern Michigan offering a class on the history of Indian boarding schools.
“I think it’s really exciting that we get this opportunity to see legal frameworks and Indigenous perspectives – especially informed by Native American studies disciplinary work – come to fruition at the state level and provide some healing for our communities,” Dettloff said.










Now is the time to be humble and ask the survivors and Tribes to lead the truth telling and reconciliation efforts.

The stories shared by survivors can help individuals and organizations like the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition put together a cohesive narrative of experiences and expose efforts to rewrite or downplay stories of mistreatment at these facilities, Dettloff said.
“These are overarching experiences that really expose some of the the inter-institutional intentions at committing genocide against Native American people,” Dettloff said. 
Nessel’s investigation could also help provide additional clarity and context to the history behind Native boarding schools, Dettloff said. It can also show the scope of a broad, intergenerational effort to eradicate Indigenous identity, he said.
While some of these schools closed more than 100 years ago, Dettloff explained that looking into these institutions can help document correspondences between school administrators, the federal government, and higher ups in the churches that ran the schools that show intention to commit acts of genocide.

“It’s not just individual teachers acting out against individual students,” Dettloff said. “These are directives given by administrators, directives given by elected leaders and directives given by the leaders of churches as well, to others who would carry out the acts of suppressing Indigenous identity through language suppression and other other means.”
Dettloff encouraged the Department of Attorney General to ensure that those who are sharing their experiences can do so in a safe, respectful and culturally appropriate manner noting that this was one of the ways the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada situated its investigations into Canada’s residential school system. 
The power of truth can be overwhelming, Dettloff said, and recognizing those truths while protecting and honoring those who come forward can help to lift that burden. She added that it’s also important to recognize these schools owe an  intergenerational, spiritual debt to survivors and their descendants.
Calls for reform and reconciliation
Leora Tadgerson serves as the director of reparations and justice for the Episcopal Diocese of Northern Michigan as a non-Christian, aiding in denominational policy reform and developing cultural competency workshops for churches to unpack Indian policy and how it relates to religious entities.
In an email exchange with the Michigan Advance, Tadgerson said Nessel’s investigation helps to give tribal people agency in their experiences and the legacy of boarding schools. 
“It offers the stakeholders (government and religious societies) the opportunity to do the right thing, and take care of their fellow human,” Tadgerson said. “Now is the time to be humble and ask the survivors and Tribes to lead the truth telling and reconciliation efforts.” 
Tadgerson said she hopes responsible institutions will open their archives willingly and unconditionally with full funding to aid in healing and restorative justice initiatives.
Additionally, Tadgerson said the investigation should go beyond the scope of crimes committed at Native boarding schools and look into the service infrastructure for these schools to ensure accountability.

“The reliving of these traumas need to turn into actionable policy recommendations to address the legacy for the state of MI,” Tadgerson said.

She advised the state to recognize its deliberate participation in the national Indian Boarding School policies, with an apology from the governor’s office issued as an executive order and accompanied by policies co-developed and approved by Michigan’s 12 Federally recognized Tribes.
Among other recommendations, Tadgerson called for a repeal of the state’s statute of limitations for sexual and physical abuse of minors, the inclusion of the boarding school era within the state’s academic standards, and to give tribes full access to identify and repatriated children who never returned from boarding schools, as the Native American Graves Protection & Repatriation Act does not apply to church grounds. 
Pointing to Northern Michigan University’s own class on boarding schools, Dettloff emphasized that students in a variety of fields could benefit from learning about their history and how they affect Native American experiences.
“I think there are some resonant effects that affect the ability of Native American students to learn at the same caliber as their non-Native peers,” Dettloff said. “And some of that might be internalized policies from schools,  It might be behaviors of teachers. It might be coming forth in other ways too representation or inclusion. But I will say that our mission statement here really does center around respectful inquiry around Indigenous issues and concerns.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-15-115001-1024x578.png,,,2026-01-16 07:56:49.091181

The Alabama Department of Corrections has settled a lawsuit that alleged staff neglect led to a incarcerated person's feet being partially amputated. (File)The Alabama Department of Corrections has settled a lawsuit with an inmate who alleged that prison officials failed to deliver adequate medical attention for his toe, resulting in amputations to parts of his feet.
The terms of the settlement between Joseph Allen Renney and the ADOC were confidential. according to a news release published on Wednesday by the National Police Accountability Project, who represented Renney in his lawsuit.
“This settlement underscores the urgency of addressing systemic medical neglect within Alabama’s prisons—a crisis that courts, advocates, and investigative reporting have documented as widespread and ongoing,” said Lauren Bonds, one of Mr. Renny’s co-counsel and the Executive Director at NPAP.

A spokesperson for ADOC said “cases settle for several reasons, including but not limited to the rising costs associated with protracted litigation” abefore referring the matter to the Alabama Attorney General’s Office. A message was sent to the Alabama Attorney General’s Office on Thursday seeking comment.
According to the lawsuit, Renney, a diabetic, broke the big toe on his left foot in March 2021 while incarcerated at Limestone Correctional Facility after trying to move from a top bunk to a bottom bunk.
The lawsuit said Renney was given a gauze pad by medical staff to clean the wound and wrap it for seven days. The following month, the lawsuit alleges, he was taken to a podiatry facility where physicians recommended the amputation of the tip of his toe to prevent the spread of infection from an ulcer that developed at the injury site.
According to the lawsuit, the physicians at the podiatry clinic planned to schedule the surgery and seek approval for the procedure with ADOC.
The lawsuit said Renney went to the health care unit in Limestone at least three times from April to July of the same year to request that his wound be cleaned and treated with antiseptic. He waited for four to five hours each time to be treated due to understaffing, according to the lawsuit. Medical personnel working Limestone provided him with a gauze and told him to clean the wound himself.
The lawsuit states that the physicians at Limestone knew of the surgery that was planned because it was notated in his medical chart. The lawsuit also states that the physicians knew that his injury was not healing but was becoming more infected because “they personally observed the toe turning black and oozing pus and blood” when they examined him during his visits. The physicians did not administer antibiotics even though they had authority, according to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit also alleges that a corrections officer prevented the surgery from going forward in July 2021, on a day when Renney understood he would get the surgery. Renney eventually underwent surgery in October after waiting for several months, according to the lawsuit, but his condition had worsened to the point that his entire toe had to be amputated.
“If Defendant medical providers had promptly scheduled the surgery . . . instead of waiting six months until October 21, 2021, then Mr. Renney would only have needed to have the tip of his left big toe amputated instead of the entire left big toe,” the lawsuit states. “In addition, Mr. Renney would have been spared months of agonizing pain, continued infection in his left foot, and subsequent additional surgeries.”
Renney suffered a second injury after the surgery in February 2022, when he tripped while climbing stairs in Limestone. The injury was on his second toe, next to the big toe on the same foot that received the surgery.
All this happened while the big toe on his left foot, the site of the original injury, remained infected and spread to the more recent injury on his second toe.
Renney was given oral antibiotics to address the infection in March. He continued to visit the medical unit at Limestone in April. It was then that medical providers at the facility recommended that the big toe on this left foot be amputated. During a visit to a podiatry clinic in May,  the lawsuit said, the physician recommended that “that the top two “knuckles” of the second toe needed to be amputated to prevent the spread of infection and the risk of osteomyelitis.”  Despite the finding from the physician, the second surgery was delayed for several more months until the “the flesh and bone of the second toe had rotted off.”  Renney was eventually taken in for surgery in August.
Renney would receive his third surgery in October, this time to amputate the top of his left foot.

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Indiana lawmakers seek to align state law with a recently enacted federal ban on intoxicating and synthetic hemp products — over opposition from the burgeoning delta-8 industry.
The lengthy, complex legislation also would regulate less potent products that do pass legal muster.
But, “there’s going to be no demand,” for products under the proposed threshold, asserted Justin Swanson, representing the Midwest Hemp Council and 3Chi, a THC product retailer.
THC is the active ingredient in marijuana.

Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, confessed in committee Thursday that he’d rather “eliminate all these things from the planet, period,” but that his proposal “is what’s possible.”
His Senate Bill 250 would mimic Congress’ closure of what Freeman described as the “Farm Bill loophole,” referring to the 2018 legislation that defined legal hemp as any part of the plant containing less than 0.3% delta-9 THC by dry weight. That definition allowed products containing delta-8, THCA and other intoxicating cannabinoids to proliferate, including in Indiana.
A stopgap federal funding law enacted in November specifies that all forms of THC count. It also caps THC products to just 0.4 milligrams per container, and outright bans lab-made ones.
“I think (that) is what was intended by the federal government in 2018 when they first passed the Farm Bill; I think it’s what everybody had in mind when that language was then copied here in Indiana,” said Chris Daniels, the senior traffic safety resource prosecutor at the Indiana Prosecuting Attorneys Council. “… The goal was very low potency THC.”
One industry group supported the changes.
“It is imperative that Indiana act during the 2026 legislative session to harmonize with federal policy,” said Cory Harris, representing the American Trade Association for Cannabis and Hemp. “Failure to do so will mean that Indiana’s policy will be less stringent than federal law, and therefore equate to Indiana being a legal cannabis market.”

The federal provisions are set to take effect in November. Freeman’s bill replicates those provisions, but sets an effective date four months earlier, in July.
“It’s premature for Indiana to codify federal law that will decimate an entire industry in the state,” Swanson said. “The landscape is still not settled.”
He noted U.S. Rep. Jim Baird — a Republican representing Indiana — filed a proposal pushing the federal ban’s effective date back to 2028. President Donald Trump also signed an executive order to speed up reclassification of marijuana as a less dangerous, less restricted drug.
Swanson said his clients do support a “responsible regulatory framework,” telling lawmakers that “the status quo is not acceptable for anybody.”
Freeman’s bill spends dozens of pages regulating the low-THC “hemp-derived cannabinoid products” that would be expressly legalized — notably, with a long-sought 21-plus age requirement.
It also puts Indiana’s Alcohol and Tobacco Commission in charge of regulating the industry that remains, implementing four types of permits for manufacturers, distributers, retailers and carriers. They’d be banned from advertising within 1,000 feet of schools, playgrounds and more, with retailers barred from operating within the same radius.
Retailers wouldn’t be able to deliver their products or let customers consume them on-site. The sale of products online would also be illegal — another sticking point for advocates.
Sun King Brewery CEO and Co-Founder Dave Colt said his homegrown company spent months and more than $100,000 dollars on equipment, research and development for its THC seltzers. Amid a nationwide downturn in alcohol sales, the seltzers have allowed Sun King to retain its staff and even grow.

“We also make products for at least a dozen small Hoosier businesses as well. Without this additional revenue, we would be forced to lay people off and dramatically downsize our business,” Colt testified. “We do believe strongly the industry wants clear regulations that meet consumer demand.”
Other provisions deal with containers, labeling and testing.
A fiscal impact analysis by the nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency estimated a half-million-dollar financial hit annually to the ATC to administer and enforce the proposal. The agency will need to hire at least one additional excise officer in each of the six districts plus Marion County to investigate complaints associated with the new regulatory framework.
There will be additional expenditures for law enforcement training, purchases, and online databases, the analysis noted.
Costs could be offset from the permit and other fees collected. The measure would direct 70% of the earnings to ATC administrative efforts, 20% to enforcement work, 5% to the state’s 988 suicide and crisis hotline and 5% to the general fund.
If all tobacco sales certificate holders apply for a retail permit, for instance, their application fees would generate $2.1 million. If they’re all approved, the state would earn an additional $4.6 million, per LSA’s analysis.
The state’s seed commissioner would handle permitting for hemp growers and handlers.
Freeman also included a sentence preventing Indiana Code from immediately reflecting federal reclassification of marijuana, if that goes through.
Delta-8 regulations clear House but headed into negotiations

“This bill simply says that we would not automatically follow what the federal government does, that we would decide, 150 of us — that we would make that decision, not the federal government for us,” Freeman told his colleagues.
The Senate Commerce and Technology committee also consented to an amendment removing an excise tax, since any provisions raising revenue must begin in the House.
The revised legislation was approved on a party-line vote of 7-2, but it must next get through the finance-focused Senate Appropriations committee before heading to the chamber’s floor.
Previous efforts to both ban and regulate intoxicating hemp products have failed.
Asked about this year’s chances, Senate Republican leader Rodric Bray told reporters, “I don’t have that crystal ball,” but added, “I think the bill right now is in pretty good shape.”
“I think we’d just like, in Indiana, some certainty as to these products so that the people manufacturing and selling them know kind of what our laws are,” he continued, “and also to build in some really significant protections for, in particular, our youth across the state.”

Some people voted for this because they thought we would merely get a correction of former President Joe Biden’s failed immigration policy. They believed that the Trumpists would only go after the “the worst of the worst.” That was deeply misinformed. 
You barely had to scratch the surface to find the fascist philosophy undergirding the MAGA movement — not to mention the “Mass Deportation Now” signs that plastered the 2024 National Republican Convention. It’s all been laid bare by official government accounts sending out white nationalist messages in recent days, e.g., the Department of Homeland Security: “One Homeland. One People. One Heritage. Remember who you are, American.”
In the face of the propaganda, chaos and crackpot despotism, regular Minnesotans haven’t lost their nerve, however. 
My favorite example is a woman named Nimco Omar quietly refusing when immigration agents asked for her papers.
“I’m U.S. citizen. I don’t need to carry around an ID. This is my home. This is my home. Minneapolis is my home. This is where I belong.” 
The visibly annoyed officers leave. 
I’ve watched it three times today. 
Be inspired by the irrepressible dignity of Nimco Omar, because here’s the thing: The people with power and influence in Minnesota are mostly going to be useless to us. 
You could find no better example than local pitchman Blois Olson, who represents corporate bosses in his PR business and sends out an email newsletter to many thousands of influential people in politics and business. Here’s what he wrote Thursday: 
“It’s not the loudest voices that deserve to be heard. Instead it’s the quiet voices that find reason and calm. That’s what we need today. This isn’t a moment for politics, it’s a moment for diplomacy — and diplomacy requires a lowering of the volume, a non-public effort and a sacrifice for peace at the expense of ‘being right.’” 
(Diplomacy is politics, but let’s move on.) 
Is he writing for Capitol lobbyists and upper-middle managers at UnitedHealth and Target, or for the ghost of Neville Chamberlain? 
“Peace for our time,” someone said on X, referring to Chamberlain’s infamous comments upon returning from the 1938 Munich conference when he caved to Hitler.
Although we should all strive for the stoic virtues and be strategic and levelheaded in our opposition — and eschew violence — it’s not a moment for “diplomacy.” 
The Trump administration has sent as many as 3,000 federal agents here; that’s nearly five times the total sworn officers in the Minneapolis Police Department. 
The Star Tribune reported Thursday that “Local attorneys are fielding dozens of complaints that ICE has wrongfully detained, threatened and physically abused bystanders amid the Trump administration’s ongoing immigration crackdown in Minnesota.” 
In an act of delicious timing, even as Olson was calling for diplomacy, President Trump was threatening to use the Insurrection Act, a 19th century law, to send in the military. (We’re already living amidst a paramilitary occupation, so I’m not sure it matters.)
It’s actually a moment for confrontation, both loud and quiet. And, for saying: No more. Take the mask off. Honor the Constitution. Better yet, leave. 
Think of Patty O’Keefe, who was profiled in this engrossing Reformer story. She spends her free time opposing ICE, tying up their resources by tailing and tracking them. In one haunting moment, federal officers approached her car door and said, “This is your one and only warning.” She courageously kept working at it, and spent all day Sunday in detention before being released without charges. 
By contrast, consider all the cowards who surrendered to the authoritarian attempt last year because they have beach house mortgages to think about: the big law firms, Big Tech, the corporate media. 
(To say nothing of the Republican Party, which has bent the knee for nearly a decade and makes a daily mockery of their decades of warnings about the threat of Big Government.)
And, locally, our biggest corporations have gone silent in the face of this federal assault. (Maybe they’re using their supreme powers of obsequious flattery, er, diplomacy, on Trump, in which case, bravo.) 
Though long protected by our liberal system and institutions, too many of our elites never really believed in liberal values like equality, pluralism and the dignity of every person, so when it came time to stand up, they were more than willing to cave to save their fancy lives. 
So yeah, it’s on us.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)A man shelters alone under the heaters of a south Minneapolis bus stop on a cold January morning, the hood of a grey sweatshirt pulled over his thick dark hair. He unzips his black outer coat and looks down, apparently searching for something tucked into the other layers of clothing. 
He doesn’t see the SUV pulling up, or the masked ICE agent exiting the passenger side door.
The man turns around and looks at the federal agent as he approaches the bus shelter. The three glass walls surround him, and the agent stands on the open side, a full head taller than the man in the grey hoodie.
The man takes a small step back. The agent takes a step forward. 
The man and the agent pass something back and forth; then, the man produces a small square of printer paper from his pocket and unfolds it. The two look at the paper. 
Then, they walk together to the car. The agent opens the door to the backseat, and the man climbs in, unrestrained.
Across the Twin Cities, journalists, activists and influencers have taken to the streets to document the actions of the thousands of immigration agents that have flooded the state. Photographers have documented violent arrests, and livestreamers have broadcast clashes between protesters and agents, painting an authentic and repetitive scene of federal actions in Minnesota. 
But an untold number of immigrants, like the man in the bus shelter, have been arrested without the whistles and cameras — plucked out of their lives in an instant.
“Moments like this ultimately and quietly change how safe people, including myself, feel in their own neighborhoods,” said Garrett Gundy, whose home security camera captured the arrest.

Many immigrants in the Twin Cities are opting to shelter in place, or work from home if possible, given the number of immigration agents on the streets. ICE and Border Patrol agents are not only carrying out targeted raids, but also scanning the streets for people who may be immigrants, then asking those people to provide documentation; NPR captured video of agents approaching people of color charging their electric cars and asking each one to provide proof of legal residency. 
A lawsuit filed Thursday by the American Civil Liberties Union alleges immigration authorities are racially profiling Minnesota residents and detaining people with legal status, including citizens.
Minnesota residents who oppose the immigration agenda of President Donald Trump have joined group chats with their neighbors so they can respond quickly to reports of ICE operations. But with the surge in federal officers arriving in the Twin Cities, ICE arrests have become quicker as agents avoid drawing a crowd.
At the bus stop, for instance, less than five minutes passed between the time the agent got out of the vehicle and when the man got in the backseat. 
Immigration officials say they have arrested at least 2,400 people since “Operation Metro Surge” began in December, according to NBC News. Deportation flights leaving MSP have increased from one or two per week in the summer of 2025 to two per day over the past week, according to Nick Benson, an anti-ICE activist who tracks deportation flights. 
“There are a number of people that are stuck at home, that fear for their lives because of what’s happening right now,” said Luis Argueta Jr., communications director for the immigrant rights organization Unidos MN.

Patrollers keeping eyes out for ICE have been monitoring immigrant-dense neighborhoods for signs of ICE activity. They film and protest the agents, and warn those nearby of immigration agents’ presence. Many have been stationing themselves around the clock at Mercado Central, which is home to dozens of Latino-owned businesses, hoping to make the workers and customers feel safe enough to do business.
When Argueta stopped at Mercado Central for lunch over the weekend, a business owner who knew him asked for help. She brought him upstairs, where Argueta saw two boys — one apparently about middle-school age and a young high-schooler — shaking and crying.
The brothers had been sheltering at home with their mother since the latest immigration enforcement surge began, but they were due for haircuts and were sick of being inside, Argueta said. 
Their mother dropped them off at Mercado Central with some money to get haircuts while she walked a short distance to cash a check, Argueta said.
She never came back.

Even though Argueta works at an organization that is tracking ICE arrests, he hasn’t been able to figure out what happened to the mother. Her children didn’t know her birth date, he said, and they would have to track that down before they could look her up in the database of immigrants in detention. Eventually, Argueta and others helped the brothers find the phone number for an aunt, who came to pick them up, with a bunch of other family members in tow.
Argueta has heard stories of arrests over and over. But he can’t get the two boys out of his head. 
“It was really tough to hear them talking and asking them questions that I would never imagine asking my own kids to answer,” Argueta said. “I just kept thinking, ‘Oh, my God, I’m asking them to grow up a little bit here and answer some really big, grown up questions.’”
It’s impossible to know how many other Minnesota children are left in similar situations when their parents are taken without warning.
Guntly, who recorded the video of the man apparently arrested by ICE at the bus stop, said he is encouraging more Minnesota residents to monitor public spaces in order to capture more of these quiet arrests.
The cameras capture other moments, too: his immigrant neighbors sprinting home from the bus stop, or hiding around the corner until they see the bus coming, while the heaters warm the empty shelter.

This year’s poster child is a move to make the breaded tenderloin the state sandwich.
Do we really need a state sandwich? No. And it does take up some legislative time to push one of these bills through a session. So far, the tenderloin bill has passed the Senate and is headed to the House.
Time will tell if it joins our list of state emblems.
The fact is, the number of state emblems has proliferated in recent years. We are way beyond a state tree (tulip), seal (bison leaping over a log) and flower (peony). We have 16 of these entities now, with six of them put into law since 2005.
State rifle. Check.
State aircraft. Check.
State snack. Check.
State fossil. Check.
A few years ago, there were attempts to add a state mammal and a state fruit, but they didn’t pass.
This proliferation isn’t just happening here in Indiana — other states have some crazy stuff on the books. I reached out to editors at our sister outlets around the nation and rounded up some examples.
Let’s start with New Mexico, which has both a state aroma and a related “state question.” I’m sure you are as curious as I was. New Mexico is the first state in the nation to have its own official aroma: green chiles roasting in the fall. The follow-up state question refers to the color of the chiles: “Red or green?”
Indiana’s state aroma? I’m going to go with manure or burning leaves. The state question would be, “IU or Purdue?”

Next up is Missouri, which has the American bullfrog as its state amphibian and jumping jacks as the state exercise.
If these were adopted in Indiana, I envision the salamander — and playing HORSE in the driveway during twilight hours.
Michigan has a fascinating one: state soil. In 1990, Michigan declared Kalkaska sand as its official state soil. It’s relatively infertile, owing to its acidic nature, but nonetheless abundant, according to the Michigan Nature Association.
Based on my land, Indiana’s state soil could be clay.
My favorite comes next from Utah — a state cooking pot. And it’s none other than the Dutch oven. Utahns also have a state gem, which is topaz.
In Indiana, I would say the cast iron skillet could be our cooking pot. As for a state gem, I think the geode is the way to go. They are abundant and beautiful.
The last one I will highlight is currently under consideration in Kentucky. A Senate bill there would establish the Treeing Walker Coonhound as the state dog breed.
This could be testy here in Indiana, as dog lovers all believe their breeds are best. But I looked at the personality traits of various breeds and settled on a Labrador. They are known for being kind, friendly, outgoing and trusting. That sounds like a Hoosier to me.

But the update ended up causing more confusion about what patients can or can’t do, cannabis advocates say. 
In the FAQ section of Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services’ website, it lists the question: As a qualifying patient over the age of 21, can I choose to purchase marijuana as a patient and also purchase marijuana as a consumer?
Previously, the answer was a straight “no.” 
“…patient ID card holders are not allowed to purchase as a consumer in a licensed dispensary,” the department, which is Missouri’s cannabis regulatory agency, stated. 
The rule, regulators said, was meant to ensure that patients and consumers stay within their allowed possession limits.
But on Dec. 8, the department changed the answer to say they don’t exactly know.
It now says: “State law does not explicitly address the question of whether an individual may choose to purchase marijuana as a consumer once they have been approved as a patient and assigned a purchase and possession limit according to that status.”
The Independent asked DHSS if medical patients need to show their patient ID card every time they buy marijuana from a dispensary — a question the cannabis advocacy group Missouri NORML has urged the department to clarify.
Lisa Cox, spokeswoman for the department, said the law is “not clear” about it, “so DHSS is not instructing patients that they must do so,” in an email to The Independent. 
Dan Viets, an attorney and board member for Missouri NORML, said he’s pleased the department has changed its position on that question — but less so on another issue.
Viets initially interpreted the department’s update to mean that the state now agreed with NORML that medical patients may purchase the same amount of cannabis as other adult consumers.
In general, medical patients are limited to a 6-ounce allotment of dried, unprocessed marijuana every 30 days. Recreational consumers are allowed to purchase up to 3 ounces every day — but they can’t possess more than 3 ounces at any one time.
Cox said it is not the department’s position that “patients and consumers have the same purchase limits. These limits are different in law, and patient limits are often specific to each individual.”
She said “the law is clear” that individuals may not exceed purchase limitations by combining patient and consumer purchases. 
For recreational consumers, the state is prohibited by law from tracking their purchases without their permission. 
However by law, dispensaries are required to track how much medical marijuana patients buy so they don’t exceed their limit. And dispensaries are required to report to the department if they observe an individual exceeding their purchase or possession limits, which can lead to fines or criminal charges, the department’s website states. 
Cox said penalties for medical patients are uncommon, and the department has never had to revoke a patient card over possession limits. 
While there are some extra steps involved, Viets said there are good reasons for people to maintain their patient status.
“Not only because you pay less sales tax,” Viets said, “but I think more importantly, because you enjoy the constitutional protection against employment discrimination.”
Andrew Mullins, executive director of the Missouri Marijuana Trade Association, sent a letter in April to leaders of the Division of Cannabis Regulation claiming the previous FAQ wording was unconstitutional.
“We believe that DCR’s interpretation that a Missourian must either be an adult-use consumer or a medical patient is neither good public policy nor a constitutionally sound interpretation,” he wrote.
After the FAQ was changed online, MoCann Trade celebrated the revision.
“We are thankful that despite some initial confusion, it now appears that DCR agrees that medical marijuana patients can also exercise their purchasing rights as an adult use customer, so long as they abide by the possession limit,” Mullins told The Independent. 
He said it’s “especially significant” because Missouri has been increasing its patient count, reaching a two-year high in medical marijuana patient applications last month. 
“This pro-patient policy clarification,” he said, “now complies with the Missouri Constitution and addresses the concerns we previously articulated on behalf of our medical cannabis customers.”
Cox said the department is prohibited from tracking consumer purchases, “so it is largely up to individuals and dispensaries to ensure they are in compliance with the portion of this rule related to purchases.”
If there is a need to verify an individual’s possession limits, such as with law enforcement, “it is important that patients know the possession limits applicable to them.” 
The department, she added, will provide as much guidance as it can to patients and consumers on what is allowed so that they remain within their legal possession limits.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Andrew-Mullins-1024x785.jpg,,,2026-01-16 07:56:49.091181

(Photo by Mary Iuvone/New Jersey Monitor)
When the Legislature ended its 2024-25 session Monday with a marathon voting session, a number of high-profile bills never made it to a final vote.
Those include measures that would have created an official statewide definition of antisemitism, shielded patients and providers from liability for getting or giving health care related to gender dysphoria and gender incongruence, and targeted polluters by forcing them to pay fines to the state.
A bill that would have barred federal immigration agents from wearing masks, which Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill campaigned on last year, also failed to advance to a full vote, as did a much-discussed bill to ban smoking in Atlantic City casinos.
New Jersey aims to take over Lakewood schools

With a new legislative session underway — the state Assembly reorganized Tuesday with 12 new members — supporters of those bills must go back to the starting line and try to get them moved through legislative committees once again.
Assemblyman Gary Shaer (D-Passaic), who sponsored the antisemitism bill and pushed for the last two years to advance it, said there are a number of lessons to be learned.
“The most obvious and clearest of all is there needs to be better communication with leadership in the Assembly and the Senate and then the governor’s office, and hopefully, with that education and additional fine-tuning, we’ll find something that works for everyone concerned,” Shaer said.
The bill, which would have had the state adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism, was opposed by critics who said it would have stifled criticism of Israel. But it had 59 sponsors in the Assembly, where at least 41 yes votes are needed for passage, and 17 in the Senate, where 21 votes are needed.
Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex), who controls what legislation makes it to a floor vote in the chamber, said the antisemitism bill was one of many “tricky bills” facing the Legislature in the last session.
“Making sure that you get the bill right — and as you all know, there were hours of testimony about that. There were free speech concerns, and making sure that we got the language right and getting everybody on the same page sometimes takes longer,” he told reporters Monday.
The transgender health care bill was nearly as popular with lawmakers as the antisemitism bill, with 39 Assembly members and 19 senators signing on as sponsors. The health care bill never even made it to a committee vote, though, dooming its chances.
Sen. Teresa Ruiz (D-Essex), one of the bill’s prime sponsors along with Sen. Nicholas Scutari (D-Union), reintroduced the bill Tuesday. Its passage is one of her main priorities, she told the New Jersey Monitor.
“I’m looking forward to working with the new administration to get it to the finish line and protect human beings in the state,” Ruiz said.
Scutari told reporters Monday that he has to “pick and choose” what bills make it to a floor vote. He has said he wants to stick to a rule that limits the number of bills the Senate votes on during a given voting session to 30, though that rule is routinely waived.
“We can’t pass every bill, and we’ll be back next week anyway,” he said.
Sen. John McKeon (D-Essex) said he expects Sherrill to support his bill that targets polluters with fines, known as the “Climate Superfund Act.” The measure advanced through legislative committees but never saw a full vote despite intense lobbying by environmentalists who said it would make fossil fuel companies “pay their fair share.” McKeon reintroduced it Tuesday.
During the last legislative session, McKeon said of Sherrill, “the answer was consistently that they were big supporters of the Climate Superfund act, so I would hope that that wouldn’t change at all.”
Coughlin said legislative leaders, when considering what bills to advance, have to be mindful of action Washington, D.C., might take. The Trump administration has targeted states and private entities on issues related to health care for transgender people and immigration.
“So making sure we get that all right is really important,” he said. “Sometimes, you guys are pretty easy to criticize us for racing things through. You should be complimenting us for taking the time to be thoughtful on these things.”

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner).The Wisconsin Assembly — seeking to align state policy with Trump administration initiatives — passed bills Thursday to exempt overtime pay and tips from income tax. Lawmakers also passed bills to make English the official language of the state as well as school related bills.
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) told reporters ahead of the session that his caucus was seeking to address affordability with the legislation, though Democratic lawmakers argued the bills would not help address the issue in an effective way.
AB 38 would implement an income tax exemption for cash tips paid to an employee that would sunset in 2028. President Donald Trump signed a law in July to allow workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually from their federal taxable income. Those earning more than $150,000 aren’t eligible for the deduction. 
The Wisconsin bill would apply the same policy when it comes to the state income tax. The deduction would apply to tips whether paid by cash or credit. 
Bill coauthor Rep. Ron Tusler (R-Harrison) said the tips tax cut is for the working and middle class. The bill passed 61-33 with a handful of Democrats joining Republicans. Rep. Lee Snodgrass (D-Appleton) and Rep. Robyn Vining (D-Wauwatosa) abstained from the vote.
“Tips are primarily earned by the working class and the lower middle class and tips should never have been taxed. A tip is a gift, it’s not income,” Tusler said. “Tips are not mandatory; they are a way to say thank you to someone.”
Tusler told reporters that his legislation wasn’t permanent because legislators want to “watch and see how it works out.” 
“I think it would be a great idea for it to become permanent someday. I hope it does,” Tusler said.  
Tusler also called on the Department of Revenue (DOR) to “get to work right away” should the bill become law to ensure it has forms ready. 
“This bill is going to pass, and it’s going to get signed by the governor, but if the Department of Revenue doesn’t get ready for that, they will not have their forms ready for the tip earners come tax time. Those tip earners will wind up paying their taxes for 2025 and then they’ll have to refile their taxes to pay it to get their tip refund back. That’s not something we should be asking working-class and middle-class taxpayers to do.”
Evers told reporters Monday that he is open to looking at Republican proposals to eliminate taxes on overtime and tips but wants to consider more “universal” forms of tax relief. He has proposed property tax relief as well as exempting certain items from the sales tax including diapers and over-the-counter medications. 
Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee) tried to introduce an amendment to bring tipped employees, who can make a minimum wage of $2.33, up to the minimum wage of $7.25. He said it would’ve helped raise the standard of living for workers across the state. 
“Restaurant workers, hotel cleaners, bartenders, and too many other Wisconsin workers still rely on the inconsistent generosity of their customers just to survive. This is a terrible system that primarily benefits bosses and corporations – it’s also rife for abuse, leading to frequent unethical and sometimes illegal behavior like forced pooling of tips, assigning of non-tipped work assignments to tipped employees, and outright tip theft by bosses and managers,” Clancy said in a statement. 
His amendment was rejected by Republican lawmakers.
The Assembly also passed AB 461 in a 61-35 vote. It would create an income tax subtraction for certain overtime compensation. Single filers could claim up to $12,500 per year under the subtraction, while joint filers could claim up to $25,000. Unlike the “no tax on tips” bill, this policy change would be permanent.
Bill coauthor Rep. Paul Melotik (R-Grafton) noted that overtime work can be essential to communities and also take a toll on family life. He said the bill would help support the “hard-working people of Wisconsin, who put out extra effort… whether it’s nurses working double shifts, deputies filling in on weekends, line workers staying late to meet production goals or service employees keeping the doors open.  
Bill to make English the official language.
AB 377 would make English Wisconsin’s official language and allow state agencies to use artificial intelligence translation tools instead of providing an interpreter to people during court proceedings.
The bill passed 51-43. Rep. Jessie Rodriguez (R-Oak Creek) voted with Democratic lawmakers against the bill.
Rep. Priscilla Prado (D-Milwaukee), who chairs the Wisconsin Hispanic Legislative Caucus, delivered her opposition to the bill in Spanish — telling lawmakers that after that they could “use Google to translate that.” Prado stood again later to deliver her remarks in English, saying she would help lawmakers out.
“You want to make it legal to use AI as a translator, which might be useful for ordering lunch, but certainly not sufficient for legal hearings, official forms and civil rights — not to mention that this implementation of AI would, quite literally, take jobs away from Wisconsinites who work as translators,” Prado said. “If efficiency were the goal, we would be talking about improving language access, not political symbolism. Wisconsin does not lose its identity because Spanish or another language is spoken. What it does lose is credibility when it ignores a substantial part of its population.” 
Rep. Nate Gustafson (R-Ormo) said he didn’t think the bill was stripping people of their identity, but would instead give people a “tool in the toolbox.” 
“It allows our legal system to move efficiently and forward instead of waiting on, let’s say, a limited pool of resources that aren’t there again,” Gustafson said. “We have declining birth rate. Our absolute workforce  is obviously diminished at this point, but we’re still reliant on people at the end of the day. There is a point where we need to give the people who are doing these jobs the tools to be more efficient.”
Bill coauthor Rep. Dave Murphy (R-Hortonville), speaking after Prado, said the speech represented a failure to communicate as most people in the Assembly did not understand what she said.
“One of the important things about having an official language for society is language draws people together, and I think it’s really important to give a society cohesiveness with people that speak the same language. Now, that doesn’t mean that this bill in some way makes it illegal, or you know, somehow, impeaches your ability to to speak another language, however  I think we are making a mistake here that if you speak English in the society — it’s a huge advantage to you.” 
School revenue and lunches
AB 457, coauthored by Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) and Sen. Rob Hutton (R-Brookfield), would require Wisconsin school districts’ financial reports to the Department of Public Instruction on time before they are able to go to referendum. It passed 52-44 with Republicans for and Democrats against. 
The bill was introduced in response to Milwaukee Public Schools’ financial scandal where the district was months late in submitting financial documents to the state. The news was unveiled just weeks after voters had approved a historic referendum for the state’s largest school district.
Rep. Christian Phelps (D-Eau Claire) said that the bill was a “distraction” from other issues that school districts and property taxpayers are facing. 
Wisconsin taxpayers’ December bills included the highest increase since 2018. The increase followed  a controversial line item veto by Gov. Tony Evers , which extended a one-time increases to school revenue limits for the next 400 years. State  lawmakers did not provide additional state aid to schools, pushing many districts to use their additional taxing authority and others to go to referendum to ask local residents to raise their own taxes.
“The Department of Public Instruction is already working through any financial issues that they need to work through with the Milwaukee Public Schools,” Phelps said. “Educators and property taxpayers just are not buying the Republican spin. They can see the impact of what this building has done on the services in our public schools and their property tax bills, so it is frankly a waste of taxpayer-funded time for us to debate this silly bill that isn’t going anywhere.” 
Referencing the acronym for the school district, Nedweski called her bill the MPS bill — saying it  stood for “maximizing public scrutiny.” Nedweski said her bill is “straightforward” and would ensure that school districts are transparent before seeking to raise property taxes. 
“Public trust was shattered,” Nedweski said of the Milwaukee schools financial reporting failure. She also asked whether the outcome of the Milwaukee referendum would have been different if voters had known about the absent financial reports. 
“As property taxes continue to rise thanks to that 400-year Democrat property tax increase, it’s imperative that voters have complete information about the financial outlook of their school district before voting to further raise their own taxes,” Nedweski said. “This bill does not ask school districts to do anything new. It is not one new hoop they have to jump through… They are already supposed to be completing and submitting their financial information on time in accordance with state law.” 
AB 226 would prohibit Wisconsin public schools, independent charter schools, and private schools participating in a parental choice program serving meals that contain certain ingredients. Some of the food additives that would be prohibited include brominated vegetable oil, potassium bromate, propylparaben, azodicarbonamide and red dye No. 3, which can be found in candy, fruit juices and cookies.
The bill is another instance of GOP lawmakers seeking to align state policies with Trump administration efforts. The exclusion of the additives is meant to target “ultra processed foods,” which were one of the top concerns outlined by Health Sec. Robert F. Kennedy and a report the Trump administration commissioned. 
It passed 53-43. A handful of Democrats, including Reps. Deb Andraca (D-Whitefish Bay), Jill Billings (D-La Crosse), Brienne Brown (D-Whitewater) and Renuka Mayadev (D-Madison), voted for the bill, while a handful of Republicans voted against the bill including Reps. Lindee Brill (R-Sheboygan Falls), Joy Goeben (R-Hobart) and Chuck Wichgers (R-Muskego).

(Courtesy photo)“Winter?  What winter?” asked the email from an old friend and life-long Montanan.  
Indeed, right now it’s still in the 50s here in Helena, in mid-January.  At night, the temperatures are not even making it down to freezing, often remaining in the 40s.  New high temperature records are being set across the state every week.  
“Winter?  What winter?” is a dang good question. 
Now maybe those who are new in-migrants to Montana — and there are many — this may seem like “really nice weather.”  And it is — for Spring, not winter in Montana.  
But for those of us who have lived here for all or most of our lives, seeing new high temperature records being set every week as the mountain ranges remain brown except for their summits, something like seasonal dislocation is occurring.  And it is not comforting because we know what’s coming — and it isn’t going to be pretty. 
The meteorologists say the Sno-Tel sites measuring snow depth at elevation are showing wide variation in accumulation — some say it’s good, some say they’re way low.  As an email from another old friend this week reported: “Snowmobilers say there’s good snow at 9,000 feet in the Tobacco Root Mountains.”  9,000 feet?!  That particular range tops out at 10,000 feet, so we basically have 1,000 feet of actual snowpack and then, well, it’s back to brown all the way down to the valleys below.
Bob Dylan famously sang “you don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows” — and indeed, you don’t need a meteorologist to know there’s no snow in our mountains, you can trust your own eyes on that by just looking around. 
What this proves – undeniably and more evident every day – is that the environmentalists were right.  The predictions of the consequences of overloading the atmosphere with human-caused pollutants are now coming home to roost.  Those predictions have been on-going for many decades, and for many decades they have been largely ignored, distorted, and contested by, of course, those with a profit motive in continuing “business as usual” in the fossil fuel industries. 
Now, that position has been wholeheartedly adopted by a science-deficient president and the kow-towing toadies larding his administration.  Despite his proclamations that climate change is a “hoax,” the reality is staring us in the face here in Montana — and no amount of propaganda is going to bring down the temperature or produce the snowpack necessary to sustain Montanans through the ever hotter and drier summers. 
Tragically, not only has the fossil fuel industry been unleashed by removing what few regulatory sidebars once existed, the administration has adopted an absolutely insane policy of massive deforestation of what remains of our national forests.  
While billions are being spent on quixotic quests to engineer huge machines to pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, those forests and their green trees achieve that job by not only removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but safely sequestering it in the soil.  And they do it for free — if we simply let them live.
Unfortunately, Montana’s governor is equally misdirected by trying to log as much of our state forests as possible, even kicking up the supposed “sustainable yield” by millions of board feet every year when there’s no guarantee that they will regrow in the changing climatic conditions. 
The environmentalists were right and remain right, and many continue the struggle to try to save something for generations yet to come.  The weather?  Nice for April, not January, in Montana — where the old hands, who know better, are asking, “Winter?

The city said the form will remain open for two months and will inform the mayor’s first-year priorities and strategies, with the aim of reaching those who have been historically left out of the decision making process.
“This survey reflects the commitment I made throughout my campaign and my career in public service to listen and govern alongside the people of this city,” Sheffield said in a statement. “Detroiters deserve a government that is shaped by their voices, their experiences, and their priorities and this survey is one way we’re turning that commitment into action.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The survey is available online but also can be filled out in person through community canvassing partners that will be around the city or at upcoming city events. Sheffield’s team is also partnering with Detroit Action, MI Poder and the Eastside Community Network to lead the on-the-ground effort. The surveys will be further available to residents at grocery stores, churches and other community spaces.
A series of community events are planned through February where residents can engage with Sheffield and her transition co-chairs, focused on priority topic areas.
The efforts six priority areas include: Thriving neighborhoods, safe and just communities, reliable transportation and sustainable infrastructure, equitable economic and workforce development, robust education and youth opportunities, and open and accessible government.

For many, the recent holiday season was a time to connect with family. For some, family includes someone incarcerated in one of Wisconsin’s prisons or jails. 
Juli Bliefnick told the Wisconsin Examiner she was incarcerated in county jail and state prison from January 2012 to June 2016. She said that many people would save up precious telephone time to call their families for the holidays. 
“People that came from more disadvantaged backgrounds would not call their families as often,” Bliefnick said.
She remembers the cost of calls putting strain on her relationship with her parents while she was incarcerated. 
While incarcerated, Ventae Parrow said he had to choose whether to spend his money on additional food items and hygiene, or on talking with family on the phone. Parrow left prison in 2020 and is an organizer for the advocacy network WISDOM. He told the Examiner that how often he talked to his family depended on how much money he had.
Nationally, jail and prison phone call rates have declined over the years, according to a report covering 2008-2021 from the Prison Policy Initiative. And in 2024, the Federal Communications Commission voted for new rules to lower how much calls could cost.
The agency announced that for the overwhelming majority of people, the upper limit on the per-minute cost of calls would drop by over half. New per-minute caps ranged from 6 cents per minute for prisons to 12 cents per minute for very small jails.
However, the agency postponed aspects of the new rules in June, including the 2024 caps, until April 2027. Then the FCC voted in the fall of last year to partially roll back the 2024 change with new caps. The commission voted to increase the caps on the cost of a minute on the phone partway back to the caps that preceded the 2024 rules. The new caps range from 11 cents per minute for prisons to 19 cents per minute for extremely small jails. The FCC called them interim caps, and said it was seeking comment on how to establish permanent caps.
Worth Rises, a group advocating for lower rates, said the 2025 revised caps will deliver substantially less financial relief to families affected by incarceration. They will take effect April 6 barring further action.
In northeastern Wisconsin, people incarcerated in the Brown County Jail currently pay a per-minute rate of 15 cents for phone calls, Captain Heidi Michel told the Examiner. They receive two free phone calls and two free messages per week.
Michel said the jail’s average daily population for 2025 was 661 people, which meets the FCC’s definition of a medium-sized jail. The 2025 caps will require jails of this size to have rates of 12 cents per minute or less. Under the 2024 rules, medium-sized jails would have to abide by a lower rate — 7 cents per minute or less — and therefore charge incarcerated people and their families less money.
The 2025 caps also allow for people to be charged higher rates for video calls than the 2024 rules. Michel said people incarcerated in the Brown County Jail can have video visitation for 18 cents per minute. A medium-sized jail can have this rate under the 2025 caps for video calls. However, the 2024 caps would have required a rate of 12 cents per minute or less.
FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said rules the commission adopted in 2024 resulted in “serious, unintended consequences.” He said that limiting how facilities could recover safety and security costs through phone call charges caused some correctional facilities to scale back or even stop offering calling services.
The Baxter County Sheriff’s Office in Arkansas announced that the phone system used at the Baxter County Detention Counter would soon no longer be available due to the regulations. Two companies claimed to the FCC in April that its 2024 order was forcing correctional facilities to end or reduce access to services, and that the two companies were forced to end service to a few facilities.
Commissioner Anna Gomez, who dissented in the rollback of the 2024 rule change, said the commission took “narrow and speculative” concerns and granted a waiver of the entire 2024 decision. She also raised the idea that the commission could have considered an individual waiver of the 2024 caps for facilities that showed that having less revenue led to communication services being unavailable.
Gomez called the FCC’s order indefensible, saying it would implement “an egregious transfer of wealth from families in incredibly vulnerable situations to monopoly companies that seek to squeeze every penny out of them.”
Wanda Bertram of the Prison Policy Initiative told the Examiner that according to the FCC, the caps were calculated to offset the cost of companies offering certain features to jails and prisons, such as call monitoring. In an interview, Bertram argued that call monitoring technology should not be funded by fees charged to incarcerated people and their families. 
Call costs for Wisconsin jails and prisons
The cost of a phone call varies across facilities. In the Eau Claire County Jail in western Wisconsin, incarcerated people pay 9 cents per minute on the phone and receive two free phone calls a week, Security Services Captain Chad Dachel told the Examiner. For the Polk County Jail, the rate is $0.19 per minute, and incarcerated people are allowed two free calls per week, according to Sheriff Brent Waak.
As of late 2021, the average cost of a 15-minute call from a local jail in Wisconsin was $3.00, according to a Prison Policy Initiative report.
In a statement to the Examiner, Mark Rice of WISDOM called for making prison and jail phone calls free for all. The effects of this would include reducing the financial challenge for families and improving the mental wellbeing of affected people, he wrote. The Prison Policy Initiative has argued that family contact also reduces recidivism.
In November, lawmakers and organizers announced a package of bills aimed at improving conditions in prisons and jails, including the affordability of communication, the Examiner reported.
ICSolutions, telephone service provider for the Wisconsin Department of Corrections (DOC), charges 6 cents per minute for calls at the department’s adult facilities, DOC communications director Beth Hardtke told the Examiner, as of late December. ICSolutions charges 1 cent per minute for calls made at juvenile facilities and continues to charge $2.50 for a 25-minute video visit or $5 for a 50-minute visit, according to Hardtke.  According to reporting from the Examiner in 2024, a family member of a man incarcerated at Fox Lake Correctional Institution said people receive two free calls every Sunday. Three free weekly messages are provided, according to the department’s website.
People incarcerated in jails and their families have tended to experience higher phone rates than those in prison, according to the Prison Policy Initiative report covering 2008-2021. Under the caps the FCC passed in 2024, the DOC’s 6-cent rate would still have been allowed; that’s a 15-minute rate of 90 cents In 2021, the average 15-minute rate for a jail phone call was roughly $3.
However, ICSolutions is required to pay the department a commission of 4 cents per minute for all calls at adult institutions. The FCC decision includes a ban on site commissions, which critics say inflate call costs. The ban will take effect on April 6. 
Will the commission ban affect state prisons?
Under state law, two-thirds of the phone commission from the contract must go to the Department of Administration, according to Hardtke. One-third goes to DOC and must be spent on services that “directly benefit” incarcerated people.
In September 2024, Hardtke told the Examiner that ICSolutions paid nearly $6.3 million in commission in fiscal year 2024. The Department of Corrections’ share was nearly $2.1 million. 
Hardtke said that “the commissions received allow DOC to purchase the following in support of the persons in our care,” and provided a list of items ranging from mail processing services to re-entry portfolios to art supplies. 
It’s unclear whether the FCC’s commission ban will affect prisoners’ ability to access items and services currently funded by  the commission money, or if other funding will sustain those items and services. However, $2.1 million is a tiny fraction of the Department of Corrections budget, and the commission money may not account for all of the funding supporting each item or service Hardtke listed. Hardtke said the Department of Corrections is continuing to evaluate how to best continue services to the Wisconsin prison population.
Bertram of the Prison Policy Initiative said that charging people higher phone rates shouldn’t be the source of money for things like free video calls that benefit incarcerated people.
The decision leaves some room for authorities to receive money from phone calls. Within the new FCC caps, a portion of up to 2 cents per minute exists “to account for the costs correctional facilities incur in allowing access to (communication services).” 
Bertram told the Examiner that an example of this would be time spent by a correctional officer to escort people to a phone bay. The FCC said this was an interim measure while it sought comment for a permanent version. 
Hardtke’s full list of items that receive funding from the commission was: “mail processing services, driver education simulation equipment, recreation equipment, exercise equipment, library resources, TVs, cable TV, art supplies, re-entry portfolios, puzzles, yarn, activity books, CD/DVD players, movies, dayroom microwaves, incentive prizes, visiting room toys/activities, media credits, dayroom newspapers, magazine subscriptions, modern technology improvements and services, bus tickets for release, dayroom ice machines, personal laundry washing machines and repairs, barber services, religious and chapel supplies and services, legal loans, lanyards, burial/cremation for unclaimed bodies, dayroom game tables, dayroom board and card games, graduation ceremonies expenses, and more.”
Before the rollback in October, the FCC postponed its rate cap rules in June. In a November interview, Bertram said she’d already heard from families about the cost of connection going up in the wake of the loss of the 2024 caps. 
“This is going to come as a shock to a lot of families who had gotten a lot of relief from the 2024 rules,” Bertram said.

The president and speaker of Ireland’s Senate, Mark Daly, joined Speaker of the Nebraska Legislature John Arch in touting the value of Arch-led legislation they expect would open doors for Nebraskans to Irish business and academic exchanges, as well as to 26 other countries in the European Union.

Said Arch: “Sometimes it’s extremely difficult to know, Where is the door? How do you actually find the opportunity to trade into the European Union? This is what Ireland is offering to us. They can help facilitate that.”
Plus, there’s the cultural bond. Roughly 12% of Nebraskans claim Irish roots.
“We have a lot of Irish people in Nebraska, a lot of descendants, a lot of heritage,” Arch said in an interview alongside Daly. “It’s a natural fit.”
If Legislative Bill 1087 passes, Nebraska would join 25 other states that have formed similar commissions with the “Emerald Isle” nation on the western edge of Europe, said Arch, who introduced the bill on Thursday.
 Ireland, big U.S. investor

Huskers without Irish ancestry also would reap job and economic growth benefits, said Arch, himself not among the Irelanders. Arch said he’s been a fan of the partnership since meeting Daly in Ireland at a conference a few years ago.

He recalled that international trip, and a visit to a university in Cork.  There, Arch heard a researcher mention a tie to the University of Nebraska, which underscored already forming pathways between the countries. 
“It was like, what? I went over to him afterwards, and it was agricultural related, they were collaborating on research in agriculture,” Arch said.











Politics and diplomacy is like American football — it’s a contact sport and you put people in the room, and that’s how you create ideas and new opportunities.

Ireland itself has a population of more than 5 million. State commission members gather annually in Dublin, said Arch, creating relationships and opportunities.
Said Daly: “Politics and diplomacy is like American football — it’s a contact sport and you put people in the room, and that’s how you create ideas and new opportunities.”
 Two-year terms

Under LB 1087, the new commission would include representatives from the Nebraska Departments of Agriculture and Economic Development. The governor would appoint members from a Nebraska university, business associations and nonprofits. A state lawmaker from each congressional district, appointed by the state Legislative Council, would serve as nonvoting members.
Two-year appointees would meet at least once quarterly, and, according to the bill, would not be paid except possibly for expense reimbursement if funds were available.
Arch foresees private fundraising and outside grants largely fueling a support fund the bill would establish. It is to be administered by DED. He said the bill would not trigger any state funding appropriation. 
A hearing on LB 1087 will be scheduled for the public to weigh in.

Arch drew a distinction between a proposed Nebraska-Ireland Commission and more typical state trade missions led by the governor or other state executives and business leaders. He said those overseas mission trips generally focus on strengthening a particular industry.
“This is much more the forming of relationships that will show us where those opportunities are,” he said. “We will discover opportunities that we had no idea — that were not preconceived.”
While in Nebraska Wednesday and Thursday (not his first visit), Daly attended the State of the State address and toured Omaha’s Boys Town, founded in 1917 by Father Edward Flanagan, who hailed from Ireland’s Roscommon. 
Daly, a senator in Ireland’s upper house since 2007 and the second-youngest person to serve as chair, said the mayor of his home county frequents the popular St. Patrick’s Day celebration in O’Neill, Nebraska. 
“We have connections that go back through the generations,” he said. “What we’re looking at here is creating new connections into the future.”

The court heard arguments Thursday from attorneys for Indianapolis-based Simon Property Group and security contractor Universal Protection Service, who maintain the lawsuit should be dismissed because such attacks can’t be foreseen.
The lawsuit in question was filed in 2024 involving Kaya Stewart, who was shot in the leg, and her younger sister, who just missed being wounded at the mall just south of Indianapolis.
Their attorneys assert that Simon and Universal were negligent in not providing adequate security, allowing the gunman to enter carrying a large backpack containing several weapons and spend more than an hour in a restroom before the attack.
Three people were killed in the July 2022 shooting before an armed bystander opened fire and fatally shot the gunman.
Family questions security
Gabriel Hawkins, an attorney for the Stewart family, told the justices that the victims should have the right to further investigate the mall’s security actions as the gunman walked through areas covered by at least a dozen video cameras.
“We know that these cameras were being monitored.” Hawkins said. “This is not a backpack that my son would carry to his high school. This is a backpack with a long extension specifically designed to carry assault rifles.”
A Marion County judge and the Indiana Court of Appeals have rejected attempts by Simon and Universal to dismiss the Stewart lawsuit on procedural grounds. 
Wrongful death lawsuits filed by the families of those killed in the shooting — married couple Pedro Pineda, 56, and Rosa Mirian Rivera de Pineda, 37; and Victor Gomez, 30, all from Indianapolis — are on hold until the Supreme Court decides whether the Stewart lawsuit may proceed.
State’s gun laws also raised
Simon Property Group attorney Michael Limrick argued that Indiana trial rules don’t allow a lawsuit to proceed in an instance where the defendants couldn’t have foreseen something like a mass shooting happening.

“Just seeing someone with a backpack walking into a mall, I don’t think anybody can then make the leap to say that’s putting everybody on notice that a mass shooting is about to occur,” Limrick said.
Justice Christopher Goff asked the mall attorney about whether the security contractor should take steps to recognize someone as a potential shooter.
“I don’t think the court wants to slip into the mode of judicially sanctioned profiling, so I have a concern about that,” Limrick replied.
He then pointed to an Indiana law that generally allows people to openly carry guns in public places.
“We say that folks can walk down having a semi-automatic rifle out in the open,” Limrick said. “If the public policy of the state is that that’s OK, then how do we then flip it around and say that anytime somebody is exercising their statutory rights and they step into your business, you’re now obligated to assume they’re going to start shooting. I don’t think we can square that.”

The legislative panel proposing to defund the economic development shop wants to shuffle some programs to other state agencies. 
The post Lawmakers advance bill to dismantle Wyoming Business Council despite governor’s office objections appeared first on WyoFile .","The Legislature’s primary budgeting arm haggled over and then passed a 58-page draft bill on Thursday to dismantle the Wyoming Business Council after the measure was shared with Joint Appropriations Committee members, and the public, for the first time the night before.
The pace at which the panel moved drew a strong rebuke from a key adviser to Gov. Mark Gordon, who at one point bluntly told the committee, “This is nuts.”
Draft bill, “Wyoming business council-repeal,” passed by a vote of 9-3. Devils Tower Republican Sen. Ogden Driskill, Jackson Democrat Sen. Mike Gierau and Laramie Democrat Rep. Trey Sherwood voted against the measure. The bill will be introduced in the Senate when the full Legislature convenes in February for the budget session. 
Gierau made a motion to table the bill in favor of prioritizing the matter as a topic to hash out after the budget session. The motion failed.
The bill, brought by Powell Republican Sen. Dan Laursen, attempts to prescribe how the business council will be dismantled and to codify the committee’s action earlier this week to defund the agency, which also passed on a vote of 9-3 along the same division.
Though both the budgeting action and repeal bill will get a hearing before the full Legislature, proponents of the effort to dismantle Wyoming’s primary economic development agency heard criticism for the breakneck speed of the effort, as well as what’s been described as an unprecedented and monumental move to eliminate a major state agency.

“We don’t know what the ramifications are,” Gierau said after several hours of debate. “I mean, this bill, in my view, is fatally flawed. That’s why I asked that we put together a task force to try to make it right.
“I hear this, ‘Oh, get the government out of the way’ [argument],” Gierau continued. “I have yet to hear one positive thing that’s come out of this about how we’re going to help business. If you think that passing this bill is going to mystically help everything out just by passing it, I think you’re fatally misguided.”
Though he voted for both measures, Wheatland Republican Rep. Jeremy Haroldson also expressed concern about the short timeline the Legislature has to decide how to hand off multiple accounts and programs under the business council’s management to other state entities.
“I also heard the Wyoming Business Council has done nothing good,” Haroldson said. “I disagree with that. I think there have been good things that have come out of this. You guys, honestly, with this conversation, it makes an incredibly large discussion point going into the next [legislative session] because a lot of this is politics.”
Proponents, including Sheridan Republican Rep. Ken Pendergraft, argued that dismantling the economic development agency stands to benefit businesses.
“This is nuts. This is crazy. You’re attempting to [eliminate] an agency that has been around for over 20 years and what appears to be a rushed bill. It appears to have a lot of questions.”Randall Luthi, Gov. Mark Gordon’s office
“The concept, the underlying idea behind this, is to get government out of the way and allow businesses to find their own way and work for themselves, to survive on their own,” he said.
Reshuffling the deck
The bill to dismantle the business council prescribes where to transfer accounts, how to administer active loans, which programs under the council will be terminated and where other programs might be reassigned among various state agencies.
For example, the Main Street and Small Business Investment Credit programs would be eliminated, while others would be transferred to agencies such as the Wyoming Office of Tourism, Wyoming Workforce Services and Wyoming Energy Authority. The Wyoming Broadband Office, currently under the business council, is managing some $400 million in federal funds. That work would be shifted to the governor’s office.
None of those agencies, according to Legislative Service Office staff, have been consulted about how or whether they can handle the new duties.
Sherwood noted that, if the bill passes, the Legislature is essentially asking the council’s staff of 38 full-time workers and two part-time workers to dismantle the organization, knowing that their jobs are being eliminated. 
“Have we contemplated what happens if they all walk on day one — that this bill is signed and then, who is left to do this work?” Sherwood asked.
Though the pre-markup version of the bill didn’t contemplate a severance package, several members suggested that such an offering could help ensure employees’ cooperation to dismantle the organization.
“This is nuts. This is crazy,” Gov. Mark Gordon’s Policy Director Randall Luthi told the committee. “You’re attempting to [eliminate] an agency that has been around for over 20 years and what appears to be a rushed bill. It appears to have a lot of questions.
“There is a way to go through each and every question that you have and be able to find a home for where things might go or where we no longer need them,” Luthi added.
Gordon’s Communications Director Amy Edmonds reiterated to WyoFile that the governor will continue to defend his budget recommendation to fund the council into the future.
“We don’t believe [the defunding effort] has had the full vetting of the people in the state,” Edmonds said. “It’s just not how we do things in Wyoming. This should be done fully noticed with multiple opportunities for the public and other entities to come and to speak on it.”
The Legislature will convene Feb. 9.

People will continue to leave Wyoming unless our leaders trade in tired tradition for policies that nurture growth, writes columnist Jessica Brauer. 
The post Familiar soil isn’t guaranteed to be fertile appeared first on WyoFile .","“You cannot ignore this problem any longer, “ then Wyoming Gov. Mike Sullivan said in a 1989 State of the State Address to the 50th State Legislature. “We are losing valued employees and faculty, and those that remain are finding it increasingly difficult to find loyalty, love of Wyoming, and personal ties enough to keep them here.” 

Opinion

This grim forewarning to Wyoming’s people, made just months before I was born, holds true. Whether by way of regressive policies, stagnant professional opportunities, depleted resources for health and safety or the unaffordability of homes in our beloved communities, our neighbors are leaving — just as Sullivan declared 37 years ago. 
Our state’s struggle to retain its residents is no mystery. It’s the predictable result of tired choices made by lawmakers decade after decade. We’re on the precipice of them doing it again. 
The Wyoming Business Council, the state’s economic development arm, recently presented lawmakers with data showing steady economic decline, stagnant job growth and shrinking wages. The state’s exodus of residents is the worst in the country at twice the national average. 
But rather than unanimously applauding the Business Council for seeking solutions, there are state legislators who, in the upcoming budget session, want it defunded. 
Quite frankly, I question the sanity of those of us who opt to stay, myself included. 
My family planted roots in Casper, a place hardened by a petroleum-fed cycle of feast and famine, long before I came into the world 36 years ago. It bred tough people. In the late 1980s, the state of our state was dismal on the periphery of a devastating bust, and I came quietly into a roughneck town. Here, Wyoming weasled its way into my bones, and I grew devoted to it, for better or worse.  
I learned that the desire to leave Wyoming was itself a rite of passage. Across state lines was the opportunity to stretch through experience — to hear new stories, to ride escalators, to eat vegan food. The elders would boast of the children sowing their wild oats in the city, their starched denim replaced with pressed suits. 
Wyoming high school grads share excitement about a world beyond the four plumb walls of our familiar square state. Stacks of dorm-sized belongings accumulate for our leap from the nest. Grand illusions of far-flung adventure aside, I hauled my mini fridge and big dreams just 150 miles south to Laramie — Wyoming’s beloved town of brown and gold.
The University of Wyoming, one of the few anchors for young people in the state, is also in the crosshairs of the Legislature’s zealous budget cutters.
My time there extended my departure, but I eventually would leave, along with most of my friends.
As I stayed rooted in Laramie, I too believed that our state’s precious minds would return after their time away, bringing expanded worldviews and fuller pocketbooks with them. Yet, through the years, the goodbyes have far outnumbered the welcome homes.
One of Wyoming’s premier exports is its educated young people, who leave to neighboring states in more of a gush than a trickle. A Harvard Growth Lab study identified that by the time people born in Wyoming reach their 30s, nearly two-thirds have left. Why did they leave? Ask former Gov. Sullivan or the Business Council or the Harvard researchers. Prohibitive house prices, a dearth of quality job opportunities and subpar services and amenities make it hard to stay. 
Yet, Wyoming has a way of tugging us back by our bootstraps. My youthful thirst for broadened horizons took me from city to ocean, only to find my mind most comforted by a return to the wide open West. However, familiar soil isn’t guaranteed to be fertile.
I fell victim to Laramie’s fabled ailment: the boomerang effect. 
In 1881, a jack of many trades, Edgar Wilson “Bill” Nye, took the lead of the new-to-town newspaper, which he named after his trusty mule. Nye said the thing about Boomerang was that he had a knack for wandering, but he always came back. 
As a mule hungry for feed or a night’s rest away from the elements of the high plains, it’s no surprise that Boomerang kept coming home to Laramie. The question is, what made him wander from his companion’s care? Did Boomerang know greener pastures were just down the road, too?
The data shows, however, that the boomerang effect may only live on in Nye’s hooved pet. Growth Lab reports show residents leave the state at a young age, and most do not return in the years thereafter — contrary to the charming legacy. Rather, the exodus only grows. Older born-and-raised Wyomingites live outside the state at increasing rates — an all-too-familiar fallout of declining access to affordable medical care and services for senior citizens.
Instead, good legislation for Wyoming’s people keeps meeting its end at the Capitol steps while the lawmakers grandstand about how we’re resilient, how it’s not government’s role to lend a hand or produce solutions to generations-old problems.
Wyoming’s resilience is undeniable — look at how our trees bend with the wind. But gutting programs that invest in our communities, support our entrepreneurs and plan for our economic future isn’t an act of courage, nor defiance against anyone but your own. It’s negligence. To turn a blind eye to the needs of Wyoming’s people is, and was always, the wrong choice, even if we’re rugged. 
I dream of a state that listens to Sullivan’s plea and sees itself as deserving of nurturing from thoughtful change-makers, not a stubborn adherence to tired tradition.

Our state faces important challenges when it comes to keeping our young people, maintaining local services and supporting our health care system, writes columnist Khale Lenhart.
The post Wyoming faces critical questions in 2026 appeared first on WyoFile .","A new year is a natural time for reflection and looking ahead. This year promises to be another important one for Wyoming, with a major statewide election and big decisions to be made about our state’s future. Looking ahead to the coming year, what are some of the major political issues we are likely to see debated?

Opinion

One key issue that will be at the forefront of many debates is what we should expect of local and county governments. Last year, the Wyoming Legislature instituted significant cuts to funding for local and county governments. Just one year in, we have seen counties and municipalities dipping into reserves to make ends meet, programs shutting down and services ending. This will only continue as reserves run out and local elected officials must make decisions on where to spend fewer and fewer dollars. 
We will see whether the people of Wyoming approve of this new style of government as roads deteriorate, infrastructure like sewer and water goes without necessary maintenance, and local services like parks, street plowing, libraries and senior centers are defunded.. Local government is often the most responsive and most impactful for our day-to-day lives, but current trends point to less local control and more power being concentrated in the state capital in Cheyenne. Expect this debate to continue.
Access to quality and affordable health care is also likely to be a major issue. Wyoming has unique challenges in this area, as our large state, low population and dispersed cities make it difficult to provide access to necessary health care across the state. We simply do not have the population base to support the full range of necessary services in all communities. Some hospitals in smaller population centers have already stopped providing vital services. For example, cities like Evanston, Rawlins, Wheatland and Kemmerer have seen their hospitals close or pause inpatient maternity services, leaving these communities without a place where expecting mothers can have their children. They must now drive to other communities, sometimes hours away, to receive necessary care. Determining how to provide health care, especially in rural communities, in a way that is economically viable for both the providers and patients, is a massive issue that we have not made much progress on yet. As our population ages, this issue is likely to become more and more urgent.
Education is also likely to be at the forefront of many debates. Our state constitution requires the Legislature to fund a top-quality education, although the question of how and what should be included is a matter of significant debate. The Wyoming Supreme Court is considering two cases that are likely to have major implications on the future of education in Wyoming, as it decides whether the state can issue direct payments to parents for non-public education and whether the state has adequately funded our public system. Regardless of the outcome of these cases, public schools in Wyoming still must provide education in an ever-changing environment. Education is the single largest expense of our state budget and will undoubtedly demand major attention. 
Perhaps the greatest question for the long-term outlook of our state is how we stem the tide of outmigration of our young people. We are an attractive state for retirees or those who have already built a career or business, but we fall behind when it comes to those starting professional life. The answer is not just low taxes. If that were the case, we would be in great shape, as our tax burden is among the lowest in the nation. We must decide to do something more to build places where families are confident they can prosper. Quality careers, access to amenities beyond just our outdoors, the education, health care and community infrastructure that gives people confidence that they can meet their necessary needs at home. All of these are areas that require attention and are likely to be major issues of public debate in the coming year.
All these topics have a common thread. They all wrestle with the question of what our state looks like in the future and what type of lives our fellow citizens will lead. We must decide whether we want prosperity or whether we want to hold fast and watch the society around us wither away. Most voters do not spend their time following legislative debates or subscribing to political dogma. They want to live good lives, provide for their families and feel like they are making progress. Political decisions can make all the difference when it comes to how our families and communities operate. Let’s hope that all of us, citizens and officials alike, recognize the importance of finding the right solutions to the questions ahead.

On Thursday, Rep. Dustin Manwaring, R-Pocatello, and Sen. Dave Lent, R-Idaho Falls, told the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee about the shortage of doctors and presented recommendations from the state’s Undergraduate Medical Education Plan Working Group. 
Overall, Manwaring called for state legislators to support and expand the state’s medical education program and seats, arguing that future medical professionals who train in Idaho will be more likely to practice medicine in Idaho. 
“We can’t go backwards,” Manwaring told the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee.
Recommendations from the report include:

Idaho must maintain undergraduate medical education capacity, both through the Idaho WWAMI program partnership with the University of Washington, as well as with the University of Utah.
Grow new undergraduate medical education capacity through University of Utah and Idaho College of Osteopathic Medicine.
Increase graduate medical education capacity, particularly for rural Idaho.
Support a new office at the Idaho State Board of Education to coordinate and expand clinical placements and preceptors. 

Manwaring estimated it would cost $350,000 to $485,000 this year to expand undergraduate medical education by 10 seats. He said it could also cost another $350,000 for the new office to coordinate clinical placements. 
Rep. Rod Furniss, R-Rigby, asked about funding additional incentives, such as repayment of medical school debt. Last year, the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee zeroed out a request from Gov. Brad Little to expand the Rural Physician Incentive Program, which provides $25,000 a year to help physicians who are practicing in areas facing health care shortages repay their medical school debt.
“Again, it’s about what are we willing to pay for?” Manwaring said. “Those incentives do work but we have to pick and choose and prioritize how much we can incentivize and how much we do it. But there is no question that works.”
This year every dollar of state funding is going to be tight. Idaho’s state budget is projected to run a deficit in the current fiscal year 2026 and next year in 2027. But Little and state legislators have vowed to cut spending during this legislative session to avoid a budget deficit. The Idaho Constitution requires the state to pass a balanced budget where expenses do not exceed revenue.

In 2025, the Legislature and Gov. Brad Little approved the creation of the accounts through House Bill 26. 
“The launch of the Idaho ABLE Savings Plan is a great opportunity for more Idahoans to save money, and I’m excited that they now have access to these accounts through Idaho’s own ABLE program,” Idaho State Treasurer Julie Ellsworth said in a statement.
Before Idaho allowed the accounts, Idaho was one of three states without them — and people with disabilities who had more than $2,000 in their bank accounts risked no longer qualifying for Social Security Income, Idaho Reports reported. 
Since the law directed Idaho to partner with a national group of ABLE accounts, the law is not projected to cost the state money, according to Idaho Reports. 
Idaho’s ABLE website has information on eligibility, contribution limits, investment options and enrollment. People are eligible for ABLE accounts if they have a disability that began before age 46, according to the Idaho State Independent Living Council.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A Memphis-area senator is spearheading legislation that would require the Shelby County district attorney to notify multiple state and federal officials any time a felony case arising from a Memphis Safe Task Force arrest leads to a plea agreement, lowered charge, or dismissal.
Sen. Brent Taylor — a Republican representing Germantown, Lakeland, Collierville and part of East Memphis — called the bill the “Memphis Safe Task Force Accountability Act.” The act does not contain accountability provisions for the task force itself, but solely focuses on the district attorney’s handling of the hundreds of cases that result from the multi-agency law enforcement force launched in September by President Donald Trump.
The act would apply to district attorney generals of any judicial district in which the Memphis Safe Task Force or Operation Viper, an FBI mission in Memphis, are operating — ostensibly limiting the scope to Shelby County.
A district attorney general is elected by the public to represent the government in criminal cases, including reviewing evidence, filing charges and prosecuting people accused of crime. District Attorney General Steven Mulroy has served Shelby County in the role since 2022.

Mulroy said Taylor’s proposal is unnecessary and only creates additional burden for his office, which is already stretched thin due to hundreds of task force arrests with no support from the state or federal government to handle the larger case load.
“Logistically, it would be a nightmare,” Mulroy said.
Nationally, more than 90% of criminal cases end in a settlement, he said, and Shelby County is no different.
“We settle cases all the time, so to have to constantly keep track of that and notify multiple bodies every 24 hours would be incredibly burdensome,” he said. “And even if it wasn’t every 24 hours, keeping separate track of just those cases that come in from the federal task force would itself be burdensome. It is not the case that we treat the federal task force cases any differently from any other case, nor should we.”
Rep. John Gillespie, the bill’s House sponsor, deferred to Taylor for comment when reached via phone Thursday. Taylor did not respond to requests for comment.
The U.S. Marshals Service reported earlier this month that the task force has arrested 4,700 people since October 2025. While the Marshals have highlighted a fraction of the arrested individuals they deem “notable,” the Marshals and other agencies involved in the task force have yet to provide a full account of the names of individuals arrested or the specific charges they face.
Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris said in December that the task force does compile arrest information, but daily updates provided to his office are marked “sensitive information,” and he could not share it due to the risk of retaliation.
Tennessee, feds provide few details on cost, arrests three weeks into Memphis task force

The U.S. Marshals’ releases initially included the number of immigration-related arrests, but the service has since stopped providing that information. Initial data showed about 20% of the task force’s arrests were for alleged immigration violations, which are handled by immigration courts and are not under Mulroy’s purview.
Mulroy said a “large percentage” of the task force cases have involved lower-level misdemeanors and nonviolent crimes. A “minority” have been violent cases, with some of the more serious cases stemming from an existing backlog of outstanding warrants that the task force has assisted local law enforcement in clearing.
Mulroy said the task force cases have increased daily General Sessions dockets by as much as 50%, though he said he’s not “trying to pour shade on the federal task force.”
“Helping us with our backlog on outstanding warrants is a good thing, but you’re asking about the effect on our workload,” Mulroy said. “It has been significant, and this law would merely exacerbate that situation.”
Mulroy also said the law is duplicative, because the Tennessee legislature passed another law in 2024 — also sponsored by Taylor — that requires each district attorney general to provide an annual report to the governor, the speakers of the house and senate and others containing the number of arrests and indictments and final case dispositions and sentences, among other things.
That law goes into effect on July 1, 2026.
Taylor has repeatedly accused Mulroy of being soft on crime, calling Mulroy the “weak link in this unprecedented investment to clean up crime” in social media posts.
In an Oct. 31 editorial published in The Tennessean, Mulroy wrote that Taylor’s characterization is false and pointed to the more than 40,000 cases prosecuted by his office each year. Taylor has repeatedly filed ethics complaints against Mulroy, which were dismissed by the state’s ethics board, Mulroy wrote.

(Photo: Community Home Trust) North Carolina’s community land trusts are working to raise the profile of their housing preservation model, which its members see as a vital tool in the struggle for affordable housing in a rapidly growing state.
Community land trusts keep housing permanently affordable by maintaining ownership of the land and selling the homes or buildings sitting on it to individuals or groups. The model removes the land cost from the purchase price, and the land trust controls resale values to ensure homes remain affordable to future generations.
Several of the state’s trusts have launched the North Carolina Community Land Trust Coalition to share best practices and resources to shape housing policy, and “increase government and philanthropic support” for the programs by educating lawmakers and the public. 
Today, more than 300 Community Land Trusts operate across the country, including a dozen or more in North Carolina. Funding comes primarily through competitive processes for grants, loans and other sources at the federal, state and local levels.

“The hardest thing to do is to find operational funding, especially for newer land trusts that are starting to be created,” said Kimberly Sanchez, executive director of the Community Home Trust in Chapel Hill. “You have to acquire land, which is not cheap and you have to hold it forever, so you have to have some level of consistent operational funding just to make sure you can keep the inventory that you have forever for the community.”
Sanchez has led the Chapel Hill-based Community Home Trust for six years. The nonprofit has been around for more than 30 years and is one of the oldest community land trusts in the state. It followed the Durham Community Land Trustees, Inc., which became the first in the state in 1987.
Collectively, the state’s community land trusts have created 394 homeownership units, 398 affordable rental units and have supported households with an average of 63% of area median income, the coalition reported.
Sanchez’s group and the Durham Community Land Trustees control hundreds of those properties, while newer community land trusts control just a few or sometimes a single property. The coalition expects 12 to 14 members, but noted that some are new and still forming and will be added to the coalition’s new website at a later date. 
Sherry Taylor (Photo:Durham Community Land Trustees)
Sherry Taylor, executive director of the Durham Community Land Trustees, said the coalition’s rise is timely, given the growing interest in community land trusts in North Carolina.
“We actually started meeting last year to come together and make sure that permanently affordable housing is at the top of mind, not just for individual areas of the state that we cover, but as a statewide initiative,” Taylor said.
Taylor noted the state law allows property tax exemptions for certain affordable housing when they’re controlled by qualifying nonprofits.
But, she added, there’s more to be done.
“We realized that attainable housing, especially home ownership, is something that is a growing need all across the state,” Taylor said. “We wanted to first inform lawmakers that this is a model that has worked all over the country and has worked in North Carolina and is still working to create attainable homeownership.”
Finding new ways for community land trusts to increase production of affordable housing would be the next step in the process, Taylor said.
“I’m not gonna list out all the ways that they [lawmakers] can possibly help this group, but I do think thinking through those things and getting in front of them will be the primary goals of our coalition,” Taylor said. 
Last year, a study commissioned by NC REALTORS®, the NC Chamber and the NC Home Builders Association highlighted the extent of the housing crisis in the state. Researchers found North Carolina will need more than 764,000 rental and for-sale units over the next five years to meet demand across all 100 counties.
The NC Housing Coalition has found that 48% of state renters are cost burdened by rent payments and 19% of homeowners have trouble paying their mortgages. A family is considered cost-burdened if it spends more than 30% of income on housing.  
Diverse models
North Carolina’s community land trusts operate differently from each other even though they share the same model, said Sanchez with the Community Home Trust in Chapel Hill. She says the model’s flexibility allows responsiveness to local needs.
“We focus on different things, the way that we’re funded is different, the way we interact with our community is different,” Sanchez said. “Durham and Chapel Hill are 10 minutes away from each other, but even just culturally, they’re totally different.”
A notable difference, Sanchez said, is that Durham focused on rentals early on while her organization focused on homeownership. Now, Durham has a growing stock of owner-occupied homes and Sanchez’s organization has entered the rental market.
Sanchez’s organization has nearly 300 properties in its portfolio. Many were acquired through Chapel Hill’s inclusionary housing policy. Under the policy, housing developers are “encouraged” to sell a few housing units to the community land trust.  
“It’s that political will that has given us the opportunity to have almost 300 homes,” Sanchez said.
A startup in Watauga County
Over the summer, the relatively new Watauga Community Housing Trust celebrated the completion of its first home, a refurbished, one-bedroom house near downtown Boone that it sold to an adult with disabilities.
The volunteer-run and member-led nonprofit was created in response to skyrocketing housing costs in one of the state’s more expensive zip codes. Boone is a major tourist destination and home to Appalachian State University, both of which put pressure on housing costs.
Ben Loomis (Photo: Watauga Community Housing Trust)
Ben Loomis, a Watauga land trust member, said the previous owner of the house contacted the then-startup about selling a lot and a rundown house at a good price.  
“It was just sort of an opportunity that was too big to pass up, even though we at the time, we had really just gotten started,” Loomis said. “That was like early 2023 and we had no money in the bank.”
Loomis said the organization spent the next summer fundraising and raised enough money to purchase the property. Over the next two years, he said, the group took out a construction loan, continued to fundraise and “basically rebuilt it from the ground up, everything from the foundation to the roof.”
Affordable housing has become an even bigger issue in region in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Helene and the historic flooding that ensued, Loomis said. Thousands of homes were destroyed or damaged in Western North Carolina, including 140 housing units that were condemned in Boone due to flooding. 
“That exacerbated all of the issues that we were focused on when Helene hit,” Loomis said. 
The new coalition is an opportunity for established community land trusts and new ones like his to share expertise to advocate for a greater good, he said.
“We see the goal as to be able to provide resources to other new community land trusts as they start up, but also to work on a higher level and do lobbying and large-scale partnerships for material donations with building companies and universities that each individual and trust may not be able to do on its own,” Loomis said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Image-3-1024x768.png,,,2026-01-16 06:56:36.700142

Yusuf Hakeem, a Chattanooga Democrat, is raising questions about the transparency of a state partnership with Turning Point, USA. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A Chattanooga lawmaker is questioning the state’s partnership with Turning Point USA, the ultra-conservative creation of the late Charlie Kirk, and the introduction of “Club America” into the state’s public high schools.
Democratic Rep. Yusuf Hakeem sent a letter Wednesday to Education Commissioner Lizzette Reynolds saying his concerns aren’t based on opposition to civic engagement or student participation, but the way the deal came about without transparency and the “broader implications” for public schools.
“It is troubling that this initiative was reportedly discussed and announced through private meetings, without prior public notice, stakeholder input or clear explanation of implementation standards,” Hakeem said in a letter to Reynolds. “Public schools are taxpayer-funded institutions, and decisions that impact students, families and educators should be made through transparent, inclusive and accountable processes.”
The Turning Point USA partnership was introduced by U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn and Tennessee Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson in a closed announcement at the State Capitol with a video from Gov. Bill Lee, who a few weeks earlier said he didn’t know anything about it. It will enable students to set up their own clubs at school, purportedly to increase civil debate. Kirk’s calling card was to challenge students to prove him wrong when discussing issues.
Hakeem, though, said he’s concerned about how the partnership would align with the idea that public schools should remain “politically neutral environments,” since Turning Point USA is a partisan organization. In fact, President Donald Trump has called it a blueprint of sorts for his second term.
TPUSA Final Letter
Hakeem questioned whether groups with opposing political points of view would be given the same opportunity. Otherwise, the state risks undermining “trust” in its schools, he said in the letter. 
The lawmaker asked for clarification on the guidelines used to approve the partnership, as well as “safeguards” for ensuring neutrality and fairness, in addition to how transparency and accountability would be handled in the future.
“Tennessee’s public schools serve students of all backgrounds and beliefs. It is essential that educational policy decisions reflect fairness, openness and a commitment to democratic principles,” Hakeem said.
The lawmaker didn’t mention some of the demeaning things Kirk said publicly about Black men and women nor Kirk’s contention after six people were killed at The Covenant School in Nashville that school shootings were the price of having the Second Amendment. He was shot to death before an event at a Utah university where he was to debate students.
The state Department of Education declined to answer questions from the Lookout about Hakeem’s letter.
“The state of Tennessee stands ready to support those patriotic students’ efforts and ensure their constitutional rights are respected,” Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, a Franklin Republican, said at the announcement of the state’s partnership with Turning Point, USA. (Photo: Sen.Jack Johnson Facebook)
Asked about the matter, Johnson said this week he believes the partnership was formed with complete transparency.
“I don’t know why somebody would think that it wasn’t,” Johnson said. “We’re excited to encourage as many Turning Point chapters (Club America) in Tennessee high schools as possible. It’s a great organization.”
Johnson said similar groups with opposing views would be able to form, too. He denied saying the attorney general’s office would provide a legal defense for the group against anyone who challenges the partnership. 
“I said that there would be consequences if someone tries to thwart the formation of (a club) as long as they’re following all the school policies like any other civic group in a high school,” Johnson.
The prediction here, though, is that Johnson and others won’t be holding announcements for a partnership with the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition.
Not only did Kirk posthumously receive the Presidential Medal of Honor, the House honored him with a resolution Thursday. Democrats objected to the move, but House Republicans used a maneuver to cut off debate and go straight to a vote that was overwhelmingly in favor.
Wouldn’t Kirk have demanded a civil debate?
One more for the road
House Republican Caucus Chairman Jeremy Faison announced Thursday he will leave the Tennessee legislature after nearly 16 years.
Faison, who earlier in the day passed the resolution honoring Kirk, won’t seek re-election to the District 11 seat representing Cocke County and parts of Hamblen and Jefferson counties in East Tennessee.
Faison said in an X statement that when he entered the House in 2010, a friend told him there are only three ways out of the legislature: losing an election, dying or walking out with your head held high, then said, “Jeremy, I don’t think you want to do the first two.”
The East Tennessean called it one of the “greatest honors” of his life and said only his faith and family are more important.
“I have nothing but respect, admiration and love for each one of you (constituents) and the greatest amount of respect and love for this institution,” he said.
A staunch conservative by most measures, Faison, nevertheless, supports the softening of Tennessee’s anti-cannabis laws.
He previously pushed passage of medical marijuana bills and said recently the federal government never had a “sound justification for a naturally occurring plant” to be classified as a Schedule I drug, which made it comparable to heroin, LSD and Ecstasy. 
Phasing out: Rep. Jeremy Faison, chair of the House Republican Caucus, announced on Thursday he will not run for reelection. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
When Trump signed an order reclassifying marijuana, Faison said he hoped it encourages medical research “that either debunks what many sick Americans have testified to or provides the evidence and foundation showing that cannabis is safer than opioids and other man-altered substances.”
Faison would like to forget it, but he infamously tugged at the pants of a high school basketball referee who was calling his son’s ballgame in East Tennessee, drawing considerable ridicule in January 2022. He was ejected from the gym.
But he is leaving the legislature on his own accord.
Another defection
State Rep. Johnny Shaw of Bolivar said this week he will not run for re-election to another term, a move that could leave the House without one rural Democrat. 
At one time, rural Democrats from West Tennessee pretty much ruled the roost in the legislature. That control started slipping away in the early 2000s and culminated with the retirement of House Speaker Jimmy Naifeh of Covington.
His departure was followed by the one-term speakership of Republican Kent Williams who partnered with Democrats to ascend to the post instead of Jason Mumpower, who was expected to win the House election for the chamber’s top job. Instead, Mumpower got stuck with the comptroller’s job, which, truth be told, gives him about as much authority as the speaker.
Shaw, a preacher and 24-year House member who often quoted scriptures to back his stances, spoke vehemently against bills to make the Bible the state’s official book, saying its teachings should be kept in the heart and not in state politics.
Not in the hunt
Democratic Rep. Aftyn Behn made a strong showing in the recent special election for the 7th Congressional District seat, pushing Republican Matt Van Epps to the limit. 
Behn cut the Republican margin of victory over the last two elections in half, whittling it down to less than 10 percentage points. Van Epps, though, picked up a Trump endorsement that pushed him to a win in the Republican primary and rode that to victory over Behn, capturing the seat mainly because of returns in Williamson County and the rural parts of the gerrymandered 7th District, which stretches from the Alabama line to Kentucky.
Rep. Aftyn Behn will use money left over from her recent congressional run to start a political organization. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
“This campaign proved something important: with real investment and serious organizing, so-called ‘red states’ can compete,” Behn said. “Political power does not have to come at the expense of our marginalized communities, and there is a growing coalition of Tennesseans who are sick of the chaos and cost of living.”
But Behn said the race came with a heavy emotional and mental cost as she endured a “daily deluge of violent rape and death threats” in addition to digital stalking and harassment of her immediate family. She said she feared for her safety throughout the campaign and would need months to recuperate.
The East Nashville Democrat said she will run again for the District 51 House seat and use $200,000 in her federal campaign account to start a new organization called “Unrigged,” which will back her efforts to run for higher office in a few years.
In other words, this ain’t over.

(Photo by John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate) Lawmakers will decide Friday whether to send an additional $32 million to Arkansas’ school voucher program, which has seen a large increase in participation after opening to all students for the first time last fall. 
The Arkansas Legislative Council is taking up a request that would push the Educational Freedom Account program’s cost to nearly $310 million for the year.
The program, created through a 2023 education overhaul known as the LEARNS Act, provides state funding for allowable education expenses such as private school tuition. Lawmakers allocated more than $187 million for the program in the state’s budget in April before approving an additional $90 million in June.
State education officials have said the extra money is needed to support the expansion of the voucher program, which has grown to more than 44,000 since eligibility opened to all students for the 2025-2026 academic year.
Lawmakers earlier this week questioned how they would make room in the budget for the growing program in the future, as well as what guardrails are in place to ensure participants are using state funds appropriately. 
Despite those concerns, the subcommittee advanced the request to the full council following a voice vote with audible dissent. The Arkansas Legislative Council’s meeting begins at 9 a.m. Friday and it will be livestreamed here.

Monks has been living in Gonzales for more than a decade. In that time, she had three children. All of them have asthma and were born prematurely. Monks thinks that exposure to pollutants might have led to their health concerns.
“I just can’t help but think, ‘Should I have not given birth here in Louisiana? You know, with all of the environmental concerns that we have?”’ Monks said. “I can’t believe I’m living, like literally living in Cancer Alley.”
Monks’ home is in the middle of “Cancer Alley,” the petrochemical corridor between New Orleans and Baton Rouge that is home to more than 200 chemical-emitting industrial facilities, which many researchers and environmental groups have linked to disproportionately high rates of cancer, pre-term births and respiratory diseases.

Now Monks is worried about yet another petrochemical project in the works, one that would be built, in part, near her kids’ school.
For the past several years, Pennsylvania-based chemical company Air Products has been working toward building a new hydrogen plant in Sorrento. The plant will process natural gas, separating hydrogen from carbon dioxide. But instead of having excess carbon dioxide enter the atmosphere, the company would capture the byproduct greenhouse gas and pipe it through Ascension, St. James, St. John the Baptist, Tangipahoa and Livingston Parishes, before storing it underground beneath Lake Maurepas. Because of its relatively low-carbon footprint, the project is being promoted as a “green” energy solution.
Air Products declined an interview for this story. During a public meeting in November, Air Product’s vice president, Andrew Connelly, said the project will, “dramatically reduce the world’s potential impact on the environment and the surrounding community.”
The project would be the largest carbon sequestration and storage project in the world, according to Air Products, and will prevent most of the plant’s carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere and contributing to climate change. But critics have said the pipeline project puts vital wetland, including Lake Mareupas, at risk.
Monks, though, worries about how the pipeline will affect her family. The hydrogen plant is being built near Sorrento Primary School, where her children are currently enrolled. The school, and the Orange Grove subdivision that it’s located in, would be just half a mile away from the proposed carbon dioxide pipeline if the project continues. And having a carbon dioxide pipeline can be risky — a report from Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that there are at least three carbon dioxide pipeline leaks every year.

Although the chemical compound is naturally present in the air, high concentrations of it can cause dizziness, headache, and in extreme cases, suffocation. In 2020, a leak in Satartia, Mississippi led to 45 hospitalizations and forced 200 residents to evacuate. Stricter regulations had been proposed to prevent future leaks near the end of Joe Biden’s presidential term, but those proposals were tabled when President Donald Trump entered office.
To continue, the project needs a coastal use permit from the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy and a Clean Water Act permit from the Army Corps of Engineers. Air Products submitted the applications early last year. Representatives from both departments said they will consider the project’s impacts on the community when granting the permits, but are more concerned about impacts to coastal waters and wetlands.
Federal and state regulations require pipelines to avoid populated places like business, schools, and neighborhoods, said Patrick Courreges, spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy. But pipelines can still be within 50 feet of those populated places if they have additional cover to protect against surface ruptures. In fact, there are already two active hydrogen pipelines surrounding the school, one of which is owned by Air Products.
The potential adverse health effects and little documentation of Air Products’ plans in case of an emergency, prompted environmental law nonprofit Earthjustive to partner with a scientist who modeled the CO2 pipeline rupture in Satartia and commission a model of what a rupture could look like near Sorrento Primary School.
“What this report shows is that the pipeline would put these kids and teachers in harm’s way,” said Earthjustice scientist Cyndhia Ramatchandirane. “There would be a very large cloud of CO2 that would cover the area, the houses, the school very quickly — within like 10 minutes.”
Because carbon dioxide is so dense, concentrations of it would be higher near the ground, where children are, Ramatchandirane said. The model predicts that the levels of carbon dioxide released could trigger respiratory distress and elevated heart rates in healthy adults, based on thresholds set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. But it’s unclear how the effects of CO2 exposure would be different for children who already have respiratory illnesses, such as Monks’ kids.
Even if a leak is discovered and the pipeline is shut off relatively quickly, the model still predicts “serious health effects” for those in the school and in the neighborhood, Ramatchandirane said. And emergency response could also be slowed down in the event of a leak, as high levels of carbon dioxide in the air prevent combustion engines, which need oxygen to work, from starting.
Emergency response is just one thing that parent Estefania Aultman, who has been working to inform her community about the plant to prevent its construction, worries about when it comes to the project. Aultman’s son attends Sorrento Primary School, and she said the town doesn’t have the infrastructure to deal with a full response to a leak.

In an email to WWNO and Verite News, Air Products said it has engaged with local first responders through the Ascension Parish Community Awareness and Emergency Response group, a collection of chemical and industrial companies that have plants in Ascension Parish working with local government to prepare for industrial emergencies.
James LeBlanc, the group’s chairman and Ascension Parish’s fire chief, did not make himself available for an interview for this story.
As part of an effort to improve community relations, Air Products has also made a $280,000 donation to the River Parishes Community College to start a year-long afterschool STEM program at Sorrento Primary and Lowery Elementary schools. The program, which started this fall and currently serves third graders, is meant to boost career readiness so that students can one day join the energy industry.
Aultman said that students at Sorrento Primary don’t often have opportunities to pursue specialized afterschool programming. She has criticized the program and sees it as a way to keep parents from speaking out against the plant.
“Do you think parents really want to talk about how they’re against Air Products if they just funded [this program]?” Aultman said.

Aultman and Monks said there has been little communication from Air Products and the parish about the project and its potential risks. Aultman said she’s reached out to members of the school board and Sorrento Primary’s principal, Honey Lundin, to ask if they’ve received information about the project from Air Products, but hasn’t received a response.
In a statement to Verite News, Ascension Parish Schools spokesperson Jackie Tisdell said the district is committed to providing safe learning environments and collaborating with community partners.
“Ascension Public Schools is focused on educating students and supporting their success,” Tisdell said. “We value our relationships with community and business partners who share in that commitment.”
Aultman, a former insulator at Exxon who used to patch leaks by tanks and pipes, said that a leak near the school would be “catastrophic.” It’s not a risk she’s willing to take. Aultman said her family will move if the project continues.
“We started looking for homes,” Aultman said. “We’re willing to fight this, but if we can’t get our voices heard and get enough community involved and engaged, like if it is just me speaking or a handful of people, it’s just not gonna be enough. And I can’t, I can’t have my family here for that.”

Patrick Morissey’s focus on improving West Virginia’s troubled foster care system, data from the state’s judicial branch shows the number of foster children living in hotels hasn’t improved over the last year. “Unfortunately, we haven’t seen a real decrease in the number of hotel youth,” said Cindy Largent-Hill, director of the Division of […]","The state is using hotel rooms and short-term rental properties to house foster children because West Virginia lacks psychiatric care for children coming into the system. (Photo by Perry Bennett/West Virginia Legislative Photography)Despite Gov. Patrick Morissey’s focus on improving West Virginia’s troubled foster care system, data from the state’s judicial branch shows the number of foster children living in hotels hasn’t improved over the last year.
“Unfortunately, we haven’t seen a real decrease in the number of hotel youth,” said Cindy Largent-Hill, director of the Division of Children’s Services in the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals. She presented the information to members of the House Committee on Judiciary Thursday at the state Capitol. 
“We tend to hover on average between 15 to 25 children a day in a hotel,” she said.
West Virginia Watch reported this week that the state Department of Human Services is also using short-term rental properties, like Airbnb, to house foster children. A child in foster care was recently injured while living in one of the rental properties and received medical care. 
Largent-Hill has served as a court-ordered monitor for the past year of the state’s use of hotels and short-term rental properties to house foster children after a 12-year-old boy involved in a case attempted suicide in a hotel last year.
The state’s use of hotels and short-term rental properties for children is due the state’s lack of psychiatric treatment beds and appropriate care options. 
According to Largent-Hill, some children coming into the system need an intensive hospital setting for ongoing medication monitoring and counseling; many of the children are struggling with self harm and suicidal ideation, she said. 
“I have never in my life seen children as challenging and as the mental health issues we’re seeing, [and] the autism, the low, low low cognitive functioning,” Largent-Hil said. “We’re seeing more children, younger children, more involved children. It’s really heart-wrenching what is coming into the system … Using hotels is a symptom of an issue within the entire child welfare system.”
In February of 2020, there were 810 in-state treatment beds available to children in the state; now, that number has dropped to about 149.
“Unfortunately, over recent years, the number of beds in West Virginia has decreased,” Largent-Hill. “After Aug. 1 of 2025, unfortunately, West Virginia lost our psychiatric residential treatment facility beds.”
The lack of in-state pediatric beds has also led the state to send hundreds of foster children to out-of-state facilities. There are 380 children in out-of-state institutions in states including California, Florida, Texas and Utah, according to DoHS data.
Morrisey announced a $6 million initiative to bring out-of-state children back to West Virginia, and he’ll need to renovate state facilities and recruit staff for these high-needs children. 
Alex J. Mayer, secretary of the West Virginia Department of Human Services
DoHS Secretary Alex Mayer shared positive changes in child welfare over the last year but told lawmakers, “In terms of hard metrics, we’re still seeing kids go out of state. We’re still seeing kids in the utilization of hotels.”
The department is having conversations with in- and out-of-state providers to increase specialized care for kids. They’ve also initiated contracts with providers to help get kids out of hotels, Mayer said. 
“So that’s also taken time, and I think we’ll start seeing a change in that trend as we’re starting to sign those contracts and get those things in place, get the training and licensing established,” Mayer said.. “I’m confident that we’ll continue to see some progressive change within the system in some of the problem areas that we’ve traditionally seen those numbers not move.”
West Virginia short on attorneys for child welfare cases 
Largent-Hill highlighted other issues in the child welfare system from the court’s perspective, including that the state saw a decrease over the last year in the number of attorneys certified to take on child welfare cases.
“We continue to have a concern and a desert of attorneys to do child abuse and neglect work,” she told lawmakers. “We have a couple of circuits that only have one.”
Last year, Morrisey vetoed a bill that would have given public defenders and guardian ad litems working with child welfare cases a pay raise of an additional $10 per hour for in- and out-of-court work. In his veto message, Morrisey said he was “sympathetic to the intent of this bill” but noted that lawmakers had reduced his proposed funding amount for the Public Defender Services.
The Republican-sponsored legislation was in an effort to improve the shortage of guardian ad litems, which are required in child welfare cases and represent the best interests of the child. The shortfall has led to cases often lingering in the court system while children await permanency. 
Del. J.B. Akers, R-Kanawha\
Del. J.B. Akers, chair of the House Committee on Judiciary, said foster care reform will once again be a focus for his committee, which met for the first time Thursday.
 There are around 6,000 children in West Virginia foster care.
“ … Until that issue is significantly resolved, that will continue as long as I’m the chairman, to be the primary focus of this committee,” said Akers, R-Kanawha. “We have a lot of issues we have to deal with, but the child welfare issues in this state will be the priority issue that we look at.”

(Courtesy of Denver Public Library Special Collections, X-11769)On the morning of Jan. 15, 1876, the town of Boulder’s leading citizens gathered at the train depot to welcome a special passenger car carrying Colorado Gov. John Routt and about 50 other dignitaries from the territorial capital, who had been invited to inspect the future site of the soon-to-be state’s flagship university.
 

This story is part of Colorado at 150, featuring special reports on the people and history that define the state.


The trustees of the University of Colorado were eager to show off to their visitors the 55-acre site donated by the town to the new college, where a state-of-the-art $30,000 building — complete with gas light fixtures, soundproofed floors and a ventilation system — was nearly finished.
“The chapel is a fine room, and, indeed, so are all the rooms on the first and second floors,” reported the Rocky Mountain News on Jan. 16. “The building committee are well satisfied with the manner in which the work has been carried on.”
Known today as Old Main, the building recently underwent its third major renovation, and ranks among the oldest continuously occupied public buildings in Colorado.
The territorial Legislature had authorized the establishment of a public university as early as 1861, but momentum had stalled for more than a decade amid Colorado’s broader stagnation during the Civil War and its aftermath. In 1874, lawmakers finally agreed to appropriate $15,000 for the university’s construction in Boulder, on the condition that the townsfolk there raise the remainder of the necessary funds.

The cause of public education, or the “common school” system, was championed by several of the Colorado Territory’s most prominent citizens — especially among liberal Republicans, who viewed public schools as a crucial tool in remaking the United States an egalitarian republic in the Reconstruction era.
Routt and his fellow visitors, who included many members of the Legislature and the constitutional convention, which had convened in Denver, were welcomed in Boulder by a committee that included John A. Ellet, a former Union Army colonel and early CU booster. Public schooling, he told the assembled dignitaries, was “the palladium of our liberty.”
“It says to the rich man, you must contribute of your abundance to educate the child of your poor neighbor, so that a knowledge of the elementary branches shall be within reach of all,” Ellet said, according to The Boulder County News, calling on the Legislature to make a “liberal appropriation” for the new university, and to levy a new tax to safeguard its future.
“​​‘Oh!’ says one, ‘but there’s the taxes. You must not increase the taxes!’ The citizens of Boulder do not feel so,” Ellet continued. “We know that if we would enjoy the blessings which modern civilization confers, we must pay for them, and we are willing to do it.”
Boulder and the university trustees wanted the 11th and final territorial Legislature to appropriate the $30,000 needed to “put the university in operation during the Centennial year,” the Rocky Mountain News reported.
Lawmakers balked at that request, appropriating just $15,000 instead. Later in the year, Routt reported that Old Main, though structurally complete, still lacked furniture, and CU Boulder wouldn’t admit its first class of students until 1877.

A war of words
Boulder in 1876 was the setting for an old-fashioned frontier newspaper war. Proprietors Otto Wangelin and Robert Tilney had launched The Colorado Banner the previous year as a Democratic rival to The Boulder County News, an established Republican journal published by Amos Bixby and Eugene Wilder.
The simmering tensions between the two weeklies — the Banner published on Thursdays, the News on Fridays — boiled over in an editorial published by the Banner on Jan. 20, 1876. Provoked by a minor dispute over whether the Banner had inadvertently made an “inexcusable thrust” at the conduct of one of Boulder County’s delegates to the constitutional convention, the Banner’s Democratic editors unleashed a torrent of invective against their Republican rivals.
“​​There are some men in this world who are happiest when they can lie,” bemoaned the Banner’s editorial.
“The efforts of the News ever since the Banner was started have been to run it down in the eyes of the people,” it complained. “The first note made of its rival was the prophecy by a dead beat that this paper would fail, the next was a charge that the Banner was opposed to public schools, a charge as false as it was malicious, then came a charge on an editorial of a possible suspension, and now is the News guilty of the above misrepresentations, gross and unjust, and which the News knows is as false as Satan.”
“What could be the object of the News in thus misrepresenting? Did it want to get on the soft side of our representative in the constitutional convention, and influence him against this paper?” the Banner continued. “The only other solution is that the News wanted to get off something smart, and that the underhanded nature again showed itself, and all because the Banner is gaining daily in circulation and patronage.”
After a series of changes in name and ownership, the two rival papers went on to merge in the mid-1880s, but the Boulder News and Banner would ultimately lose out to the Boulder Daily Camera, which published its first issue in 1890.

(Photo by Perry Bennett/West Virginia Legislative Photography)Another legislative session has started in West Virginia, and call me naive, but I’m feeling a little optimistic when it comes to environmental issues. Over the last year, West Virginians have paid attention to things like proposed dirty data centers in their communities, rising utility bills and the lack of clean water for many residents.
It’s not fair that we have to deal with these challenges. West Virginia shouldn’t be a testing ground for out of state actors to put their data centers and reap the profits while leaving us with the burden of dirtier air and water. We shouldn’t allow our power bills to spike because some lawmakers and the Public Service Commission dedicate themselves to propping up coal plants and discouraging renewable energy, even though it is typically cheaper and faster to build. 
It’s worse that our state and federal representatives have hardly lifted a finger to solve these problems. In fact, they’ve often doubled down. 
But this year could be the start of a different path. This week, state environmental organizations, including the West Virginia Environmental Council (disclaimer, I’m the board president) released a policy book outlining experts’ and citizens’ legislative priorities. We didn’t just write this book for legislators under the golden dome, agency leaders or the decisionmakers at the Governor’s mansion, but for readers like you, too. 
Sometimes the issues we discuss can sound too nebulous or too boring for even the strongest environmental advocates. With this book, we broke down complex issues like forever chemicals and data center development. Readers can get insight on what the current local landscape is for each topic. We also recommend actions that the legislature can take to start making headway towards solutions. Some of these actions include reforming the data center legislation that passed last year, funding the Flood Resiliency Trust Fund for the first time and addressing our state’s mine and gas well crises. 
We designed every section to provide a succinct overview of the issue. Readers interested in learning more, can always reach out to WVEC and the authors and organizations listed in each section. This is just the inaugural edition. It’s our hope that the book will grow in the years to come. There are more environmental challenges that we face than we could include in the book. Please tell us what you think we missed or should include next year. 
Use this to start conversations. It’s our hope that this policy book can help West Virginians become stronger advocates for the environmental issues that are affecting their communities. Now it’s time for our legislators to listen to the expert guidance in this booklet and rally for the health and wellbeing of their constituents.

(Examiner file photo)According to a Legislative Fiscal Bureau (LFB) analysis released on Thursday, Wisconsin’s general fund balance at the end of the biennium, June 30, 2027, is projected to be $2.37 billion. The projection is about $1.53 billion above the projected balance when the 2025-27 biennial budget was enacted last year.
According to the LFB, the majority of the growth, $1.367 billion, is due to an increase in estimated tax collections. Other contributions to the growth include $104 million in departmental revenues, an increase of $49.9 million in sum sufficient appropriations and an increase of $107.8 million in the amounts that are estimated to lapse to the general fund.
Both Republicans and Democrats sought to take credit for the news.
Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) and Sen. Howard Marklein (R- Spring Green) said in a statement that Republicans’ “long-standing commitment to responsible budgeting and fiscal discipline is working.” 
The lawmakers warned that the state should continue to exercise caution. 
“These increased revenue estimates are driven in part by strong stock market performance and resulting tax collections,” the lawmakers said. “We must be careful when committing to ongoing spending using one-time money. Our disciplined approach has delivered results and put Wisconsin in a strong fiscal position.”
Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) said that the numbers are “a tribute to Wisconsin Democrats, who have prioritized investments in the people of Wisconsin that have improved our state’s economy, provided middle class tax relief and helped make Wisconsin a state where businesses want to invest and families want to live.”
Gov. Tony Evers told reporters that the revenues were larger than expected on Monday and he wanted to use the funds for priorities including over $1 billion in property tax relief. Republican lawmakers have said that they want Evers’ 400-year veto, which gave school districts the ability to enact annual revenue limit increases, repealed in order to deal with rising tax cuts.

As more such deadlines pass (in half the states by March 15, and in 32 by the end of March), more Republicans in Congress will no longer fear a Trump-endorsed primary opponent and will be more willing to buck him.
There were several signs of that as Congress reconvened. Massie and Rep. James Comer were among 35 House Republicans who voted to override Trump’s spiteful veto of a Colorado water project. Comer represents the 1st District, would like to be elected governor next year, and may figure that he needs a few fig leaves of independence from a president who may be largely discredited by the time November 2027 rolls around.
By that time, Gov. Andy Beshear will probably have been a declared presidential candidate for some time, and he keeps moving closer to it, most recently and publicly in his Jan. 7 State of the Commonwealth and budget address, which was chock-full of hints.
Beshear said “American” or “America” 30 times, beginning with “To every Kentuckian and every American watching from home, good evening.” (The address was on C-SPAN and covered live by Jonathan Martin, senior political columnist and politics bureau chief for Politico, ahead of an interview with Beshear the next day.) Most of those references were to “the American Dream,” which the governor said is being threatened by “the president’s big, ugly bill.”

The address was given in the state history center, because the Capitol is under renovation – “a reminder that our great democracy at times can buckle, and that cracks in the foundation and stress on the joints can threaten our very future,” Beshear said.
Most of the speech was a Beshear brag-and-propose litany, but there were enough national references to hold the attention of Democrats in other states. And Beshear continued his steady improvement in presentation, much as one of his national rivals, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, did the next night in Sacramento.
Beshear cited Kentucky as an object example to a country “looking to find hope beyond the chaos” and “a national politics poisoned with division,” a state where “we’ve found a way to work together, to find unity, and to succeed.” But Republican legislators have long been the state’s main policymakers, due to their big majorities, and most didn’t attend the speech. Senate President Robert Stivers said Beshear’s presidential chances were worse than a snowball’s in hell.
Stivers and House Speaker David Osborne have little use for Beshear, and continue to reject his call for universal pre-kindergarten. Beshear surely knows his big policy proposal is doomed; he said “If you’re against this because you think it gives me a win, what you’re really doing is handing these kids a loss.”
Perhaps Democrats in this year’s legislative elections can make an issue of pre-K, but it would make little difference in the balance of power because they don’t even have candidates running for most Republican seats, as Louisville Public Media first reported.
Beshear described Kentucky’s political situation best when he compared it with the nation’s: “In Kentucky, we’ve turned down the temperature.” That’s mainly due to traditional Republican leaders like Stivers and Osborne, who have done a good job of thwarting most of their feverish members’ wishes. For example, Osborne said on KET Monday night that Somerset Rep. Shane Baker’s bill to bar naturalized citizens from public office has constitutional problems.
On the same show, Stivers revealed that he had rebuffed a White House request that the legislature split Jefferson County among more congressional districts in order to oust 3rd District Rep. Morgan McGarvey, the only Democrat in the state’s delegation. He also said legislators hadn’t discussed further limiting the governor’s powers — which Comer was surely glad to hear.
So, as we pray for the national fever to break, let’s be thankful that Kentucky isn’t so badly afflicted.

Glenn Youngkin reflected on his four-year term. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)As he prepares to hand the keys of the Executive Mansion to his Democratic successor, Gov. Glenn Youngkin says his four years leading Virginia exceeded even his own expectations — a tenure he describes as transformative, results-driven and largely free of regret.
In an expansive interview with the Virginia Mercury on Thursday in the governor’s Cabinet Conference Room at the Patrick Henry Building in Richmond — less than 48 hours before Abigail Spanberger is sworn in as Virginia’s 75th governor — Youngkin framed his administration as one that fundamentally changed how state government operates, despite four years of divided government.
“I really don’t like the question about people’s legacy. What I think most about is, what is the impact that we’ve had on Virginia going forward,” Youngkin said. “And it really is a comprehensive transformation of the state, and where it’s going.”
Youngkin, a former private-equity executive who entered public office as a political outsider, said he rejected the idea that governors must limit their ambitions to a narrow set of achievable goals. 
Instead, he said, his administration pursued broad changes across nearly every area of state government — from education and public safety to economic development, behavioral health and core state services.
“We came in with a mindset of transforming the way government works, and defining success as delivering results as opposed to activity,” Youngkin said. “That transformation is not defined by a bill or a single program. It is a comprehensive effort that changes the way things are done and delivers results.”
The remarks echoed themes from Youngkin’s final State of the Commonwealth address Wednesday, in which he highlighted record economic investment, regulatory rollbacks, education reforms and public safety initiatives.
 A businessman governor grappling with divided government

Youngkin, 59, was elected in 2021 by narrowly defeating former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe, winning a then-purple state at a moment of pandemic-era frustration over school closures and remote learning. 
He governed for four years, with Democrats controlling both chambers of the General Assembly for part of his tenure — a dynamic that shaped both his accomplishments and his conflicts.
“I am encouraged by the fact that we have this comprehensive transformation … while we have a divided government,” Youngkin said. “Because we never had the General Assembly aligned with us. And we still were able to accomplish all of this.”
Youngkin said divided government forced negotiation but did not derail his administration’s fiscal agenda, pointing to budgets approved with bipartisan support and the ability to fund major initiatives.
“We generated $10 billion in surplus revenue, $9 billion in tax relief, in a divided government,” he said. “We delivered the funding to support the transformation in education, and behavioral health, and made sure that we could change the way we do business development.”
At the same time, Youngkin used his veto power aggressively during his tenure — a fact Democrats say underscores how often the governor clashed with the legislature.
House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said Youngkin struggled to define a clear governing vision and often prioritized cultural fights over affordability.
“He vetoed a record number of bills,” Scott said in an interview Thursday. “So what did voters do? They hired me to be speaker in the middle of his term, they fired his Republican speaker, and they gave us the majority.”
Scott said Democrats frequently pushed back against what he described as Youngkin’s emphasis on cultural issues rather than kitchen-table concerns.
“The governor wanted less teacher pay; we got more teacher pay. He wanted less for health care; we got more for health care,” Scott said. “He spent most of his time fighting culture wars.”
Scott said Youngkin’s rise was tied to a specific set of circumstances rather than a durable realignment of Virginia politics.
“I think his legacy will be, for Virginia, that he was a flash-in-the-pan governor,” Scott said.
Despite those disagreements, Scott said his personal working relationship with Youngkin improved after Democrats re-took control of the House in 2023, and he credited the governor with making a consistent effort to engage once Scott became speaker.
Scott said Youngkin regularly attended his weekly interfaith prayer breakfasts — early-morning gatherings held every Wednesday at 7 a.m. during the legislative session.
“He didn’t miss one, ever, when I was speaker,” Scott said. “So I give him a lot of credit for that.”
Scott also said he respected Youngkin for entering public life from a position of professional and financial success.
“He could have stayed rich and continued to do his thing,” Scott said. “But the fact that he put his name in the hat and entered the arena, I admire that as well.”
 Economic development and deregulation

In the interview, Youngkin framed his record primarily around jobs, investment and what he described as a fundamental reshaping of how Virginia competes for business.
He pointed to what his administration says is $157 billion in committed capital investment, record job growth and a sweeping effort to reduce state regulations.
“When I wrote that executive order on day one to get 25% of our regulations either removed or streamlined, there was the big question, ‘Sir, how do we do this?’” Youngkin said. “And before you know it, we not only got through 25%, we got through 35% of regulations, streamlined saving Virginians $1.4 billion a year.”
Although it’s still not clear exactly how his administration calculated those reductions, Youngkin emphasized that they were accomplished entirely within the executive branch. “There was no bill,” Youngkin said. “It was a managerial exercise.”
Youngkin also pointed to decisions by major companies to locate or expand advanced manufacturing and pharmaceutical operations in Virginia, including facilities announced by AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly and Merck.
These businesses, he said, “made a decision to come and build their futures, their largest facilities in the world, right here in Virginia. That ecosystem is now so strong that we’ll continue to see great companies come.”
House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, said those corporate commitments — along with Youngkin’s sustained attention to Southwest Virginia — shape how the governor is viewed in much of rural Virginia.
“I think his legacy for Virginia is he’s been our job creator,” Kilgore told The Mercury in an interview Thursday. “On a personal note, he really helped Southwest Virginia during the disasters. He showed up.”
Kilgore said Youngkin’s visibility during the devastating flooding spurred by Hurricane Helene in 2024 and the ensuing human suffering left a lasting impression.
“Seeing him in action when people lost everything, and here Governor Youngkin was praying with them and talking to them — that was really impressive,” Kilgore said.
 Education, behavioral health and public safety

Youngkin said education reform was another defining feature of his administration, citing new accreditation standards, revised academic benchmarks, cellphone restrictions in classrooms and expanded tutoring initiatives.
“We established expectations of excellence,” he said. “We overhauled the entire accreditation system.”
But some of Youngkin’s education changes drew sharp criticism, particularly his administration’s initial overhaul of the state’s K-12 history and social science standards. 
Early drafts were widely criticized by educators, historians and civil rights groups for omitting context on race and slavery and for what opponents described as political bias, prompting delays and significant revisions after a contentious public review process. 
Youngkin also pointed to investments in behavioral health, calling the system “broken” when he took office and crediting his administration with fundamentally changing how services are delivered.
Veteran Virginia political analyst Bob Holsworth said those efforts may be among Youngkin’s most durable accomplishments.
“I think he can take some credit for making further progress on addressing the behavioral health issues in Virginia,” Holsworth said. “And he was very popular in Southwest Virginia for the fact that he showed up a lot.”
Still, Holsworth argued that Youngkin’s governing style relied heavily on executive authority rather than legislation.
“When you look at his legacy, he has no legislative legacy. What you saw on Wednesday was a list of executive actions,” Holsworth said, referring to Youngkin’s final speech before the joint legislature this week, where he touted his accomplishments.
 Controversies and regrets

Asked whether he regretted any decisions, Youngkin said he did not — though he expressed frustration over the collapse of a proposed Northern Virginia sports and entertainment complex, which Senate Democrats blocked amid opposition led by Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth.
“That was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It would have benefited Virginia hugely,” Youngkin said. “And it was blocked wrongly.”
The proposal would have brought an estimated $12 billion in economic development and 30,000 jobs, according to the administration. Opponents said it wasn’t a project citizens should be responsible for financing, and pointed to possible transportation and environmental challenges with the arena plan. 
Youngkin also defended his approach to higher education governance, where his board appointments at UVA and other institutions sparked partisan battles.
“I’m so proud of the board work that our team has done,” he said, criticizing Senate Democrats for blocking nominees he described as highly qualified.
 Trump, national politics and political fallout

Youngkin rejected the premise that he distanced himself from Donald Trump during his 2021 campaign, saying Trump’s 2016 victory influenced his decision to run while his own race remained focused on state issues.
“One of the primary influences on my decision to do that was the fact that a businessman named Donald Trump had stepped out of his life, run for president, and won,” Youngkin said, echoing sentiments he shared in a speech at the Republican National Convention in 2024 where Trump became his party’s nominee for president. 
“In my race, the key was focusing on state issues, local issues, and not a federal race, because at the end of the day, governor is a state job.”
Youngkin said his relationship with the Trump administration during the president’s second term benefited Virginia through preserved grant funding and federal cooperation.
Holsworth said that embrace ultimately proved costly for Republicans in Virginia, who lost all three statewide races in November.
“That turned out to be a debacle of historic proportions for his own party,” he said. “He essentially made the Democrats’ argument.”
Scott echoed that view, saying Youngkin’s political pivot was noticeable.
“It took him almost four years to begin mentioning Trump’s name,” Scott said.
 Leaving office

As he prepares to leave public office, Youngkin said he was surprised by how much his administration was able to accomplish — and by how much he enjoyed serving alongside his wife, Suzanne, whose work on fentanyl prevention he repeatedly praised.
“I didn’t expect we could get this much done,” Youngkin said. “I had ambitions and dreams of what we might be able to do, but I was told by everybody, there’s no way you could do it.”
With his term ending and a transition underway, Youngkin said he is ready to step away from public office, at least for now.
“We’re taking a break,” Youngkin said. “Suzanne and I are going on vacation to an undisclosed location.”

(Stock.adobe.com image by s_l).State officials this week voted to tap private health insurance plans to make up for an expected loss in funding and rate-setting control as Maryland transitions to a new federal framework for Medicare payments to state hospitals.
The changes approved Wednesday by the Health Services Cost Review Commission will not take effect for at least a year, but will likely mean higher premiums for people on private health insurance plans when they do kick in.
It’s part of a multiyear shift to the new Achieving Healthcare Efficiency through Accountable Design, or AHEAD, model of setting hospital rates for Medicare services in the state.
Private insurers are less than pleased with the new plan.
“We remain concerned that the state relies again and again on the commercial market when unaffordable health care costs already burden Maryland families and businesses,” said Matthew Celentano of the League of Life and Health Insurers in Maryland, in response to Wednesday’s policy approvals.
The state’s previous hospital rate setting system technically came to an end on Dec. 31 — even if major changes in state operation have not yet occurred. The old model, called the Total Cost of Care system, gave Maryland officials authority to regulate hospital costs across all payers in the system, which include private insurance, Medicaid and Medicare.
Total Cost of Care leveled costs for patients across coverage types, so that different patients did not end up paying more for the same services. Those rates are set by the Health Services Cost Review Commission.
Work AHEAD: State, federal officials finalizing terms of new hospital system in Maryland

Maryland has had the authority to set Medicare hospital rates for more than 40 years, but it will lose that authority under the AHEAD model by 2028, when rate-setting will revertto the federal government. AHEAD also requires the state to reduce Medicare spending by $435 million annually.
The changes approved Wednesday would increase hospital rates for the commercial market by $87 million annually, beginning in 2028. State officials estimate that those rate increase will add a total of 1.8% to private consumers’ premiums by 2032.
That’s not a huge hike in premiums, but it comes on top of growing health care costs generally. Last year, state insurance officials approved an average 13.4% rate increase for 2026 health care plans to account for the expiration of a federal tax credit that helped thousands of Marylanders afford health care in the Affordable Care Act marketplace.
Subsidizing Medicare Advantage
Wednesday’s changes also turn to private insurance plans to fund efforts to preserve Medicare Advantage — supplemental, private insurance that provides coverage such as vision, dental and transportation assistance that may not be covered by standard Medicare plans.
About a quarter of Maryland Medicare recipients also use Medicare Advantage, but thousands have lost that coverage recently as insurers pull out of the state, where they say the current hospital system makes it too costly for them to do business.
In an effort to keep insurers in the state, the changes approved this week would let Medicare Advantage plans reimburse hospitals at a rate about 11.55% less than what they pay, starting in 2027.
To offset the financial loss to hospitals, the HSCRC plans to raise rates for private insurers. State documents say commercial rates are expected to increase by 0.75% “once fully implemented” from the Medicare Advantage stabilization policy.
“Total increases to commercial rates across both proposals will amount to 2.55 percent by 2032, with the largest single-year increases occurring in 2028, at 0.6 percent combined for the two programs,” according to the Department of Health.
Jon Kromm, executive director for the cost review commission, said that both policy recommendations approved Wednesday have the possibility for “refinements” and other changes in future discussions.
Maryland has used state funding in the past to prop up the Medicare Advantage market, but with state lawmakers facing a $1.5 billion budget deficit this year, officials were wary of relying on state dollars again.
Thousands of Maryland seniors notified of the end of their Medicare Advantage plans

 
“It seemed like a reasonable plan to fix it,” Gene Ransom, CEO for MedChi, the Maryland State Medical Society, said Thursday of the approved Medicare Advantage policy.
“The only question I really have is that we kind of have the problem now. So, you’re kind of waiting until ’27. What happens between now and ’27?” Ransom asked.
It’s one of many questions facingthe Maryland health care system as it continues its bumpy transition to AHEAD.
State and federal officials had signed an agreement in 2024 that would have largely kept the state’s authority to regulate all payers intact. But the Trump administration decided early last year to renegotiate the terms of that agreement, the start of the move toward the AHEAD model.
State and federal officials went back and forth over how much authority Maryland should have to dictate hospital rates. Ultimately, the state was allowed to keep much of its hospital payment system for two years, allowing time to implement larger policy changes before revoking the state’s authority to set Medicare rates in 2028.
Maryland Health Secretary Meena Seshamani said that AHEAD will help the state move toward a “world-class health care system,” but there is still “a lot of good work ahead of us.”
“Landing the model with CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) was absolutely a team effort,” she said via Zoom during Wednesday’s HSCRC meeting. “I think we know when this all started, it created a lot of uncertainty for the market, for the communities in our state.”
Gov. Wes Moore (D) instructed Seshamani in September to create a multi-agency workgroup — including the health department, the HSCRC, state insurance officials and other health-related officials — to work on implementing some of the larger changes under the AHEAD agreement.
Cost-sharing and stabilizing the Medicare Advantage market are the first two priorities the workgroup has addressed so far, with more to come.
“We have landed in a place that will be incorporating feedback from everyone and all the perspectives to have something that works for the entire state, from the hospitals to the payers to individuals to Maryland businesses, the physicians,” Seshamani said.

Eleven groups petitioned the agency in 2022 to protect the yellow and purple critters that are found in shale and sandstone rockfaces in West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Those habitats have frequently been subject to blasting for mountaintop removal mining. 
The lawsuit alleges that the agency has missed the mandated timeline of 12 months to conduct assessments on species that could qualify for the endangered or threatened lists. 
The Fish and Wildlife Service found in 2024 there is a possibility the salamander may qualify for special protections under the Endangered Species Act. It stated in the January 2024 release that a review would begin. But it has been two years and a decision has not been made on adding them to either list to get critical habitat protections –  which prompted the group to file the lawsuit.
“These are some of the most imperiled salamanders on the planet and they can’t wait any longer for protections,” said Will Harlan, a senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Without federal action these salamanders will go extinct on our watch.”
The conservation groups fear that much of the salamander’s populations have been wiped out due to mining and road construction in the mountains where the species is solely found. The petition estimated that only about 200-400 of the salamanders remain across its range. If they were listed as endangered species, then their habitat would be safeguarded by law and require the federal government to create a plan on how to boost the population.
Petitioners identified that the yellow-spotted woodland salamanders not only experience habitat loss but are faced with disease, pollution, and invasive species challenges. 
“Appalachia is a global biodiversity hotspot for salamanders, with more salamander species than anywhere else in the world,” the Center said in a release about the lawsuit. “Today 60% of salamander species are threatened with extinction.”
This comes as the Department of Interior recently announced plans to roll back portions of the Endangered Special Act. Those changes would narrow what could be considered critical habitat and potentially limit the species that can be placed on the protection lists.

When Centene paid the settlement, then-Lt. Gov. Husted was part of the administration that was in charge of the program that had allegedly been defrauded. 
The administration of Husted and Gov. Mike DeWine suspended contract negotiations with Centene for a few months in 2021. But taxpayer dollars flowed again after Centene hired an old friend of DeWine’s to lobby the officials on its behalf.
Husted’s office didn’t respond to questions for this story — including whether he thinks it’s important to fight fraud. 
DeWine appointed Husted to the U.S. Senate at the beginning of 2025 after he spent six years in an administration marked by one of the biggest corruption scandals in Ohio history.
Catherine Turcer, executive director of the watchdog group Common Cause Ohio, said it’s disconcerting that Husted took big donations from a company that had paid millions to settle allegations of massive fraud against Ohio taxpayers.
“We expect our elected officials to turn their backs on donors who have committed fraud,” she said. “We expect them to step away and repudiate that. One way they can do that is by refusing campaign contributions.”
Tax cuts for the rich, but no health subsidies for the modest

Husted voted last summer for President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which cuts more than $1 trillion over 10 years from Medicaid and federal food assistance to the poor. At the same time, it extended Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, providing a $1 trillion windfall to the richest 1% of Americans, and adding $4.1 trillion to the national debt.
But while Husted voted to extend tax cuts heavily tilted toward the wealthy, he repeatedly voted against extending 2021 subsidies for 600,000 moderate-income Ohioans to buy health insurance in a marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act. About 70% of the people using the ACA exchanges make 250% or less of federal poverty guidelines. For a family of four, that’s $80,375 a year.
Before the subsidies expired at the end of 2025, experts predicted that expiration would cause premiums to more than double, on average. 
Now that they have expired, that appears to be the case. The New York Times reported on Tuesday that nationally, enrollment has already dropped by 1.4 million. 
That’s about 6% of the 24.2 million Americans who get insurance from the program. Experts told the paper that if the subsidies aren’t reimplemented, that number likely will rise, and many who stop using the ACA marketplace will no longer be insured.
After a 43-day government shutdown in a fight over the subsidies, Husted took to the Senate floor in November to propose freezing the amount spent on the subsidies, adding further restrictions, and extending them, but just for two years. 
He also proposed requiring everybody to pay something, no matter how poor they were. He said that would stop a problem with fraud that the Commonwealth Fund said already had been largely fixed, while proposing further steps that didn’t involve making the poorest pay.
Fraud in Ohio Medicaid
Concerns about fraud were addressed in 2021 when the administration to which Husted belonged decided to resume business with Centene. The company owns Buckeye Community Health Plan, one of the Medicaid managed-care providers that administered much of the $28 billion the department spent that year.
Managed-care providers act in many respects like insurers — with the major difference being that taxpayers pick up the tab. They sign up clients, create provider networks and they pay claims.
They also work with pharmacy middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs. Those companies decide which drugs are covered, negotiate non-transparent rebates with drugmakers, and they decide how much to reimburse pharmacies that purchase and dispense them. 
In 2017, while DeWine was still Ohio attorney general and Husted was secretary of state, two PBMs charged taxpayers far, far more for drugs than they were reimbursing pharmacists. 
A 2018 audit of the opaque system showed the PBMs — part health conglomerates CVS Health and UnitedHealth — charged the state $224 million more for drugs in 2017 than they paid Ohio pharmacists, who even then were closing their doors at an alarming rate.
Centene-owned Buckeye Community Health Plan added its own PBM to transactions that were already running through the CVS PBM. Centene charged taxpayers an additional $20 million in 2017. 
Centene denied that it was double-dipping — even though it and CVS were unable to point to any unique services the Centene PBM provided.
Despite its denials, incoming Attorney General Dave Yost in 2019 launched an investigation and filed a lawsuit in 2021. 
Just three months later, Centene settled with the state for $88.3 million. It didn’t admit wrongdoing, but it also announced that it was setting aside more than $1 billion to settle similar claims with more than 20 other states that hadn’t even sued it.
“Centene used sophisticated moves to bill unearned dollars — moves known only at the top levels of health care companies,” Yost said in a written statement announcing the settlement. “It has taken a huge effort by my team to untangle this scheme — and now that we know how it works, the alarm bells should be ringing for anyone using similar tactics.”

Husted is a long-standing opponent of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama’s signature law. 
“I wasn’t in Congress when Democrats created the broken ACA system or the Biden (health care) subsidies… ,” he said last month.
Despite Husted’s criticism, his supporter Centene owes its massive size and much of its current identity to the ACA. 
Its annual revenue was just $4.45 billion in 2010. That figure mushroomed to $163 billion in 2024, largely by providing Medicaid managed care.
Through it all, it has supported Husted’s political career with donations, giving his campaigns $75,000 over the past two decades.
Turcer of Common Cause said people and companies don’t make donations of that size for the mere sake of good government.
“When you look at why someone gives $50 to a candidate, it’s probably because they really like that candidate,” she said. “But when you start getting into thousands of dollars, those folks want something. They want a policy, they want to develop a relationship so that they can get their phone calls returned quickly. They are making those larger contributions as a way to grease the wheels.”
At the beginning of 2021, as Yost was investigating Centene’s dealings with Ohio Medicaid, the company hired Michael Kiggin, DeWine’s law school classmate and close associate. Kiggin signed on to to lobby DeWine, Yost, Husted, and the Medicaid department on “decisions regarding Medicaid managed care” on Centene’s behalf.
During the fraud investigation, the Medicaid department suspended negotiations over a managed-care contract for 2022. But two months after a settlement was announced, the Medicaid department announced it was resuming business with the company — without mentioning the fraud allegations.
And while Husted continues to have problems with the Affordable Care Act and fraud in its subsidy program, he has not voiced any problem with Centene — a company that has benefitted greatly from the ACA and was credibly accused of defrauding millions from Ohio Medicaid.
A year ago, DeWine appointed Husted to fill the U.S. Senate seat that was vacated by JD Vance when the latter was elevated to the vice presidency. 
Since June, Centene executives have contributed $29,000 to Husted’s effort to be elected in his own right next year, according to records at the Federal Election Commission. 
Meanwhile, company executives appear not to have contributed anything during this cycle to Husted’s likely Democratic challenger, former U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown.
Turcer said elected officials shouldn’t take political contributions from companies that are credibly accused of ripping off taxpayers.
“If our elected officials don’t turn their back on those who are engaged in shenanigans and focus on protecting Ohioans and our pocketbooks, we’re all going to be taken advantage of,” she said.

(Photo by Molly Rains, New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire and its counties may soon be barred from enrolling publicly owned lands in carbon sequestration programs.
“We don’t see sequestration as a traditional use,” said Rep. Mike Ouellet, a Colebrook Republican, at a hearing before the House Committee on Municipal and County Government on Tuesday. The committee later voted, 13-1, to recommend passage of House Bill 1205, which would prohibit “carbon sequestration projects” on state- and county-owned lands.
Forest carbon sequestration is the process through which trees absorb carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas released in large volumes by the burning of fossil fuels, from the atmosphere. Then, trees lock that carbon away for storage by converting it into plant matter. Disturbances like logging and wildfires cause forests to release some carbon back into the atmosphere.
Healthy forests sequester carbon naturally as they grow. Through carbon sequestration contracts, landowners monetize that ability, often marketing it to companies wishing to offset their carbon emissions by purchasing carbon “credits” elsewhere.
The contracts that form the basis of sequestration projects vary. They may permit a range of management practices or require a hands-off approach, and they typically last anywhere from a couple decades to a century, according to Steven Roberge, forest resources state specialist with the University of New Hampshire Cooperative Extension.
No county- or state-owned land is currently listed on the registry of New Hampshire carbon sequestration projects maintained by the Division of Natural and Cultural Resources. But the long duration of forest carbon contracts and the possibility they would impose restrictions on land use were two reasons bill proponents cited for preventing them on public lands in the future.
“It’s very clear how New Hampshire wants to use its forests, its land, that it’s used for the public enjoyment and not strangled by somehow entering into 100-year contracts,” said Executive Councilor Joseph Kenney, who represents the state’s northern district, at the hearing.
Others said timber harvest could be an important source of revenue for counties and the state, and worried the contracts would have a negative impact on the timber industry. Ouellet, who introduced the bill on behalf of prime sponsor and Milan Republican Rep. Arnold Davis, said sequestration was not one of the traditional uses of public lands.
“We bought that land, as taxpayers, with certain expectations of what it was going to be used for,” he said. “Tying it up … feels like a break in trust.”
Rep. Alvin See, a Loudon Republican, also spoke in favor of the bill. He requested an amendment to add cities and towns to the list of entities that cannot enroll lands in the program, “so that there’s no question that it applies to all public land.”
However, Matt Lahey, public policy director for the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests, spoke in opposition to the bill. Carbon sequestration projects can bring revenue to forest landowners, including counties or the state, he said. He also spoke in opposition to a blanket prohibition on such projects as proposed by the bill.
“We take that position acknowledging that there are a whole bunch of questions about these forest carbon markets,” he said, “but we also believe, the forest society believes, that these types of programs could be one option for a forest landowner to generate some more revenue.”
Carbon sequestration and carbon storage are two of the many resources forests offer and can be managed to maximize, Roberge said in a phone interview. But such management strategies don’t always need to occur in the absence of other land uses. Different markets for carbon credits carry different levels of expectation for forest management and use. While some are strict, others allow some activity such as selective timber harvesting, he said. 
The UNH Extension does not advocate for or against any particular management strategy, said Roberge, who added that managing a forest for just one resource like timber or carbon is generally ineffective.
At the hearing, one landowner said carbon sequestration projects often required hands-off management that defers logging to prioritize mature and old-growth trees. 
Mature and old-growth forests are important ecologically and for carbon storage: They store multiple times more carbon than younger, managed forests, and can also continue to accumulate large volumes of carbon if left alone, according to a 2025 study by researchers at the Woodwell Climate Research Center and Wild Heritage.
But one thing that’s often misunderstood about forests and carbon, Roberge said, is the different roles played by forests of different ages. While mature and old-growth forests are important for carbon storage, young, rapidly growing forests have an important role to play, too: as they grow, they rapidly capture the element and sequester it away.
“I think about forest carbon as a bank account,” Roberge said. “Sequestration is the interest rate and storage is the balance. The higher the interest rate, the more your balance grows. … (Old growth) forests are definitely beneficial to have, but so are very young forests. That diversity is very important. We need all those things on the landscape.”
Rep. Julie Gilman, an Exeter Democrat, suggested the statute be changed to an enabling statute, allowing counties or the state to take action themselves and opt-in to prohibiting carbon sequestration projects on their lands. 
“Every county is different,” Gilman said, adding that counties could consider their landscape and timber availability when deciding whether to allow such projects.
“Under current law, counties are permitted to enter into contracts with businesses and other organizations,” said Rep. Laurel Stavis, a Lebanon Democrat. The bill, as proposed, would set up carbon sequestration programs as the only businesses counties could not engage with, she said. But Ouellet said he felt that restriction was justified to honor the intended use of public land.
Ultimately, Gilman was the only representative on the committee to vote against recommending the bill.
A House study committee is currently tasked with studying the topic of carbon sequestration, including the tax impact and policy around the practice, and its impact on forest management and the timber industry. A moratorium on new sequestration contracts on both public and privately owned land over 500 acres is in place until November 2027.

Getty ImagesNearly three-quarters of all state student aid money nationwide was based on financial need rather than merit in the 2022-2023 school year, according to the College Board.
In Georgia, that number was around 1%.
Georgia is an outlier when it comes to the money available for college students without the money for an education or the grades and test scores for a merit-based scholarship.
But that could be changing with the expansion of the University of Georgia Foundation’s DREAMS Scholarship program announced by Gov. Brian Kemp Thursday.
Kemp proposed a one-time investment of $325 million in state funding for the program, which is seen as a potential companion to the merit-based HOPE Scholarship launched in 1993 under Gov. Zell Miller.
“In this era of high prices and new challenges for those graduating from high school, we also recognize the advantage need-based financial assistance can give to those who would not otherwise be able to access higher education,” Kemp said in an address to the state Legislature.
“Like their peers who have the means to attend college, these students have great dreams for rewarding careers and impactful lives, but they do not always have hope that those dreams can become reality,” he added.
The new scholarship could provide up to $3,000 to students who meet qualifications, including that they work or volunteer at least part time. Recipients also need to be Georgia residents, demonstrate financial need after all their other scholarships and grants are considered and complete a financial literacy course.
Georgia student loan borrowers have the second-highest average student loan balance in the nation at $42,300, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Of the $325 million, $25 million would be direct scholarship money, and the rest would serve as seed money for an endowment, the proceeds of which the foundation would withdraw from every year to pay for the scholarships. The plan is to grow the endowment so it could support offering tens of millions of dollars in aid to students.
Sen. Nan Orrock, an Atlanta Democrat, called the plan “a tremendous victory.”
“This is a work of labor of a good nine years from people around the state, committed educators and counselors who saw students just falling through the cracks because their families were not in a position to write a check for their higher education financing,” she said.
Orrock chaired a Senate committee that met several times last year to study college affordability. That committee estimated that annual funding of over $120 million could have funded about 99,000 students per year, Orrock said. The committee also recommended using money from the Georgia Lottery’s unrestricted reserve to pay for scholarships, a pot of money Kemp and his fellow Republicans have been loath to draw from for recurring expenses.
Orrock said she was unbothered that Kemp’s proposal did not match the committee recommendations.
“We’re on the road, and we’re optimistic that there’s going to be broad buy-in for this vision,” she said. “And as we see the success rate, the successes that come from it, we’re going to continue to build it to fully fill the need that’s out there.”
Ashley Young, senior education analyst with the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, said advocates have been calling for needs-based aid in Georgia for decades and called the plan exciting but said she will be waiting to see further details, especially what kind of financial need students will need to demonstrate.
“It’s a little bit hard to understand how much of an impact it can make, just because we don’t have some of those specifics answered,” she said. “But certainly the model of ensuring that we are establishing a program that is based solely on student need and not merit is a step in the right direction.”
State Rep. Chuck Martin, an Alpharetta Republican who chairs the House Higher Education Committee, expressed confidence that the program will benefit Georgia students.
“I don’t have all the details, but I have great trust in the governor for putting that in the budget,” he said. “So I look forward to working with them on what’s necessary to see the implementation. We just want to see the investments that are made be productive, and I’m sure they have a plan to do that.”

Lived experiences shape how science is conducted. This matters because who gets to speak for science steers which problems are prioritized, how evidence is translated into practice and who ultimately benefits from scientific advances. For researchers whose communities have not historically been represented in science – including many people of color, LGBTQ+ and first-generation scientists – identity is intertwined with how they engage in and share their work.
As researchers who ourselves belong to communities that have been underrepresented in science, we work with scientists from marginalized backgrounds to study how they navigate STEM – science, technology, engineering and math – spaces. What happens when sharing science with the public is treated as relationship-building rather than a one-way transfer of information? We want to understand the role that identity plays in building community in science.
We found that broadening the ways scientists work with the public can bolster trust in science, expand who feels they belong in STEM spaces and ensure that science is working in service of community needs.
 STEM spaces as an obstacle course

Science communication involves bridging knowledge gaps between scientists and the broader community. Traditionally, researchers do it through public lectures, media interviews, press releases, social media posts or outreach events designed to explain science in simpler terms. The goals of these activities are often to correct misconceptions, increase scientific literacy and encourage the general public to trust scientific institutions.
However, science communication can look different for researchers from marginalized backgrounds. For these scientists, the ways they engage with the public often focus on identity and belonging. The researchers we interviewed spoke about hosting bilingual workshops with local families, creating comics about climate change with Indigenous youth and starting podcasts where scientists of color share their pathways into STEM.
Instead of disseminating science information through traditional methods that leave little room for dialogue, these researchers seek to bring science back to their communities. This is in part because scientists from historically marginalized backgrounds often face hostile environments in STEM, including discrimination, stereotypes about their competence, isolation and a lack of representation in their fields. Many of the researchers we talked to described feeling pressure to hide aspects of their identities, being seen as the token minority, or having to constantly prove they belong. These experiences reflect well-documented structural barriers in STEM that shape who feels welcome and supported in scientific environments.
We wanted to see if a broader definition of science communication that incorporates identity as an asset can expand who feels welcomed in scientific spaces, strengthen trust between scientists and communities, and ensure scientific knowledge is shared in culturally relevant and accessible ways.
 Transforming STEM communication

Prior studies have found that scientists tend to prioritize communication focused on conveying information, placing much less emphasis on understanding audiences, building trust or fostering dialogue. Our research, however, suggests that marginalized scientists adopt communication styles that are more inclusive.
Our team set out to create training spaces for researchers from communities that have been historically marginalized in science. Since 2018, we have been facilitating ReclaimingSTEM workshops both in-person and online, where over 700 participants have been encouraged to explore the intersections of their identities and science through interactive modules, small-group activities and community-building discussions.
Expanding what counts as science communication is essential for it to be effective. This is particularly relevant for scientists whose work and identities call for approaches grounded in community connection, cultural relevance and reciprocity. In our workshops, we broadly defined science communication as community engagement about science that could be both formal and informal, including through media, art, music, podcasts and outreach in schools, among others.
While some participants mentioned using traditional science communication approaches – like making topics concise and clear, as well as avoiding jargon – most used communication styles and methods that are more audience-centered, identity-focused and emotion-driven.

Some participants drew on their audience’s cultural backgrounds when sharing their research. One participant described explaining biological pattern formation by connecting it to familiar artistic traditions in her community, such as the geometric and floral designs used in henna. Using imagery that her audience recognized helped make the scientific concepts more relatable and encouraged deeper engagement.
Rather than portray science as something neutral or emotionless, participants infused empathy and feeling into their community engagement. For example, one scientist shared with us that his experiences of exclusion as a multiracial gay man shaped how he approached his interactions. These feelings helped him be more patient, understanding and attentive when others struggled to grasp scientific ideas. By drawing on his own sense of not belonging, he aimed to create an environment where people could connect emotionally to his research and feel supported in the learning process.
Participants found it important to incorporate their identities into their communication styles. For some, this meant not assimilating into the dominant norms of science spaces and instead authentically expressing their identities to be a role model to others. For example, one participant explained that openly identifying as disabled helped normalize that experience for others.
Many felt a deep sense of responsibility to have their science engagement be of service to their communities. One scientist who identified as a Black woman said she often thinks about how her research may affect people of color, and how to communicate her findings in ways that everyone can understand and benefit from.

 Making STEM more inclusive

While the participants of our workshop had a variety of goals when it came to science communication, a common thread was their desire to build a sense of belonging in STEM.
We found that marginalized scientists often draw on their lived experiences and community connections when teaching and speaking about their research. Other researchers have also found that these more inclusive approaches to science communication can help build trust, create emotional resonance, improve accessibility and foster a stronger sense of belonging among community members.

Centering the perspectives and identities of marginalized researchers would make science communication training programs more inclusive and responsive to community needs. For example, some participants described tailoring their science outreach to audiences with limited English proficiency, particularly within immigrant communities. Others emphasized communicating science in culturally relevant ways to ensure information is accessible to people in their home communities. Several also expressed a desire to create welcoming and inclusive spaces where their communities could see themselves represented and supported in STEM.
One scientist who identified as a disabled woman shared that accessibility and inclusivity shape her language and the information she communicates. Rather than talking about her research, she said, her goal has been more about sharing the so-called hidden curriculum for success: the unwritten norms, strategies and knowledge key to secure opportunities, and thrive in STEM.
 Identity for science communication

Identity is central to how scientists navigate STEM spaces and how they communicate science to the audiences and communities they serve.
For many scientists from marginalized backgrounds, the goal of science communication is to advocate, serve and create change in their communities. The participants in our study called for a more inclusive vision of science communication: one grounded in identity, storytelling, community and justice. In the hands of marginalized scientists, science communication becomes a tool for resistance, healing and transformation. These shifts foster belonging, challenge dominant norms and reimagine STEM as a space where everyone can thrive.
Helping scientists bring their whole selves into how they choose to communicate can strengthen trust, improve accessibility and foster belonging. We believe redesigning science communication to reflect the full diversity of those doing science can help build a more just and inclusive scientific future.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Nationwide, the number of people buying health plans on Obamacare insurance marketplaces is down by about 833,000 compared with a year ago, according to federal data released this week.
Many states are reporting fewer new enrollees, more people dropping their coverage, and more people choosing cheaper and less generous health insurance plans with higher deductibles.
Across most states, Thursday was the last day to enroll for plans that start in February. But nine states and Washington, D.C., have deadlines later this month, so the numbers could change.
There are 21 states with state-run health insurance marketplaces, and the rest use the federal website. The vast majority of states have seen declines in enrollment so far, compared with around this time last year.
Preliminary data released Monday by the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services shows 22.8 million enrollees, down from a record total of 24.3 million last year.
Premiums have surged as a result of the expiration of enhanced federal subsidies first made available by the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021 and later extended through the end of 2025 by the Inflation Reduction Act. The availability of the subsidies spurred a sharp increase in the number of people buying health plans on the marketplaces. In 2020, 11.4 million people were enrolled in marketplaces through Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act. More than double that amount enrolled last year.
Dozens of states tackle high prescription drug costs

Congress failed to reach an agreement on extending the subsidies before the end of last year and still hasn’t reached one. As a result, premiums were expected to increase this year by 114% on average — from $888 last year to about $1,904, according to estimates made in September by health policy research organization KFF.
The higher costs appear to be driving many people to forgo insurance or opt for cheaper, less generous plans this year, health officials and analysts say. Several states with state-based marketplaces — including Georgia, Illinois, Minnesota, New York, Vermont, Virginia and Washington — are reporting fewer enrollments this year in comparison with enrollments through early January 2025, according to early data. Other states, such as California, are reporting fewer new enrollees.
“It’s important to consider that this is preliminary data, so this represents people who have signed up and selected the plan — but they probably haven’t received their first premium bill,” said Elizabeth Lukanen, executive director of the health policy research organization State Health Access Data Assistance Center at the University of Minnesota. “Once that happens, I think there’s concern — and it seems very possible — that people may decide to drop coverage. So, the decline could get bigger.
“On the other hand, open enrollment hasn’t closed, so you have two things sort of competing. It seems pretty likely that there will be a decline,” she said.
If the downward trend continues, the nation could see the first decline in enrollment since 2020, Lukanen said, adding that a full picture of income levels and demographics of people who have dropped coverage won’t be clear until the summer.
In Pennsylvania, data updated through Tuesday shows more than 15,000 previously enrolled adults between the ages of 55 and 64 have dropped coverage entirely — the most of any age bracket.
Pennsylvania’s state-based exchange, Pennie, has seen about 15% fewer new enrollments compared with last year. The state is also reporting 1,000 residents dropping coverage per day during open enrollment — with the most coverage losses among people with incomes 150% to 200% of the poverty level. These could include families of two adults and two children with an income between $48,225 and $64,300.
The state is seeing an “unprecedented” number of previously enrolled people dropping coverage, said Devon Trolley, executive director of the Pennsylvania Health Insurance Exchange Authority.
States go their own way as RFK Jr. shifts federal vaccine policy

California is reporting 31% fewer new enrollees this year compared with last year, and more than a third of new enrollees are choosing bronze plans — the lowest, least generous coverage tier — up from less than a quarter at this time last year.
In Minnesota, data as of Dec. 3 shows more than half of active enrollees are opting to keep their coverage tier. But of those changing plans, more than a third — 37% — are going to cheaper plans. The state notes a full picture won’t be available until March.
Meanwhile, some states are seeing roughly the same number of enrollees or more. Texas, for example, is reporting about 4.1 million people enrolling this year compared with 4 million last year.
Charles Miller, health and economic mobility policy director at Texas 2036, a policy research nonprofit, said it’s unclear why enrollments are up, but pointed to some clues.
“Texas had a uniquely large population of uninsured individuals eligible for free and inexpensive plans that hadn’t enrolled previously … [and] has more affordable bronze and gold plans than many states,” he said.
He attributes that to a bipartisan state law, enacted in 2021, that had the effect of increasing subsidies for those plans, Miller said.
Nevada is seeing fewer enrollees overall. But compared with this time last year, the state is seeing 29% more people who are actively shopping the website to explore plans, said Katie Charleson, communications officer at the Nevada Health Authority Division of Consumer Health Services.
The state introduced a new public option, according to the Nevada Current, and health officials told lawmakers last week that about 1 in 5 people are opting for that plan.
One Big Beautiful Bill Act complicates state health care affordability efforts

In addition to the expiration of the subsidies, the cost of coverage has risen because of other factors, according to insurers. They say they’ve had to raise premiums because of rising prescription drug costs, inflation and workforce challenges, such as provider shortages.
But the enhanced premium tax credits were aimed at buffering those year-to-year changes for Americans with lower incomes, said Trolley, adding that the tax credit structure “helps make sure that [enrollees] don’t see those really larger drops that happen from time to time, sort of from those market forces.”
“When there are broader rate increases of … the total cost of the coverage, the tax credits are structured so that people who get a tax credit don’t feel a lot of that increase. They’re sort of sheltered from it on a year to year basis,” Trolley said. “The tax credit is tied to someone’s income and limits what they pay as part of their income, not necessarily tied to the cost of the coverage.”
She added that she’s also heard from some residents who say they are waiting to enroll in a plan to see if Congress takes action.
“People are leaving the ACA marketplace because the trade-offs have just become harder to justify,” Lukanen said. “What worries me is that when the coverage becomes unaffordable, it isn’t that people suddenly stop needing care. They just lose the protection that insurance offers, and those health care costs don’t go away.”











If people are going to the doctor and they don't have insurance, these costs are then just shifted.


– Elizabeth Lukanen, executive director of the health policy research organization State Health Access Data Assistance Center at the University



Lukanen added that if more people forgo coverage, health care services may end up costing the nation more overall.
“If people are going to the doctor and they don’t have insurance, these costs are then just shifted. They’re shifted to hospitals, ultimately to the community and the taxpayer.”
Trolley echoed that, saying she’s concerned about the overall burden on providers in rural counties, which are seeing the highest drops in Obamacare coverage in Pennsylvania.
“Any increase in the uninsured rate is going to further strain providers that are in rural areas, especially — further strain their financial situation,” she said. “We are very concerned about that in Pennsylvania.”

Republish photo only with original story.)Former Ohio Supreme Court Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor is spending her retirement tending to a new puppy, and fighting to preserve the judicial branch of the United States.
The longtime Ohio judge and former lieutenant governor has been spending her retirement working to improve her profession and the government surrounding it.
Since leaving the center chair on the state’s highest court at the end of 2022 due to age limits, O’Connor has sat on task forces and international constitutional court advisory groups, and was a figurehead in an effort to change Ohio’s redistricting process from the current politician-led Ohio Redistricting Commission, to a citizen-led panel.
She left the court vehemently protective of the independence of the judiciary, and insistent that judges remain impartial and apolitical. She spent her career standing on the issues and fighting politicization of the judiciary, no matter who she might offend in the process
  ‘Judges don’t have a constituency’
When lawsuits over congressional and statehouse redistricting came to the Ohio Supreme Court, O’Connor was criticized for standing with the majority in rejecting five different statehouse maps and two congressional maps as unconstitutional.
A known registered Republican, she received letters from fellow party members saying she was “not acting like a Republican.” She even faced impeachment threats from fellow Republicans
“I wanted to say there’s no higher compliment to say that I’m not acting like a political figure,” O’Connor told the Capital Journal. “Those letters just crystalized the thought of people who don’t understand that judges don’t have a constituency. If they bring their politics into the courtroom, they don’t deserve to wear the robe.”
With that in mind, it wasn’t a hard decision for O’Connor to join a new national effort called the Alliance to Protect Judicial Independence.
The group of more than 40 former state chief justices, brought together by the nonprofit group Keep Our Republic, plans to promote civic education and “safeguarding the constitutional balance envisioned by the Founders,” according to a press release announcing the group.

While active judges are ethically bound to remain impartial and be careful in expressing opinions to the public, the alliance of former judges has a different power.
“We are liberated from that because we are no longer sitting judges and we can speak out,” O’Connor said.
An open letter also released by the alliance emphasizes the importance that judges answer to the rule of law, much differently than elected officials who serve a specific district or area. The judges are also fighting against attacks by those see the judiciary as “just another political branch.”
“Such attacks undermine the integrity of the rule of law and threaten the promise of equal justice,” the letter states.
The attacks on the judiciary can be in the form of physical attacks, but O’Connor said verbal attacks by way of discrediting the integrity of a judge or pressuring judges to rule in a certain way have dangerous impacts on the entire system.
“I think there’s a sense, when our leaders foment the idea that judges are biased, judges are corrupt, judges are not judging according to the law … it’s a trigger for people to maybe step it up, and that can take a lot of forms,” O’Connor said.
While she said receiving criticism from those disgruntled by a particular decision or conviction “comes with the job,” those with a pulpit to sow more broadly negative ideas about the judicial system shouldn’t be working to damage it so comprehensively.
“I’m talking about people that have a platform, that use that platform to denigrate the judiciary, and they single out one judge because of their ruling, but they do it multiple times, and that undermines the public’s faith in the judiciary,” O’Connor said.
The former chief justice said the alliance’s plan is to educate and restore respect for the judiciary, which can be the most forgotten when it comes to elections.
She said “drop off” on ballots — when voters don’t vote on particular candidates because they’re lower on the ballot or seemingly less important — is a major issue in judicial races. Because judges aren’t able to campaign in the same way as a governor or a state representative, for example, they aren’t seen as much and can often be seen as less important.
“I’ll tell you, most people don’t deal with the judiciary, they don’t care, but they don’t understand the extent of how judges impact their lives,” O’Connor said.
It’s a good thing when an individual hasn’t had to face a jury trial, or hasn’t had to deal with a divorce or custody battle, but O’Connor said the fact that everyone has a connection to someone who has had to deal with those issues.
Along with more widespread issues like redistricting or constitutional challenges, it shows the vital role of the courts, she said.
“It’s extremely important for people, even if they themselves are not going to be in divorce court … for the sake of the community, it’s so important to have a qualified judge in that position,” she said.
  Politics, judges and 2026 
Ohio judges face a different challenge. One thing “I despise,” O’Connor said: Ohio law that requires a political affiliation on supreme court and appeals court candidates.
O’Connor was chief justice at the time the legislation was introduced, and she said former state Rep. Bill Seitz asked her about it as he pushed for the move.
“It was the result of the loss of some Republican judges,” she said. “(Seitz) talked to me about it, I said ‘This is not a good idea,’ but the legislature did it.”
The move to add a party affiliation to even a few judicial races “diminishes the independence of the judiciary, because people then have in their minds that this person is political,” according to O’Connor.
While some have argued that placing political parties on the ballot helps inform voters about the judges’ legal philosophies and thought processes, judges in the alliance believe a push to bring politics into the judiciary will only hamper the ability for the system to act as intended.
O’Connor pointed to political leaders, public discourse, and the media as sources for the politicization of the judiciary, and said it “truly should not matter.”
“There’s media and there’s also disgruntled citizens who will foment that kind of perception that the judge made the decision and their politics entered into it, and that in a nutshell is what the problem is,” she said.
But as the 2026 elections loom large on the horizon, political divisiveness that is prevalent in the U.S. is leading to a larger movement to make changes, according to the retired chief justice.
“There’s just something about what’s happening in America that people are — I’m not going to say it’s just one thing, it’s a different motivation for different people,” O’Connor said. “But it’s all the same: ‘We’ve got to do something, we can’t let this go on.’”
As to her own politics, O’Connor readily acknowledges “this is not the Republican Party that I joined so many years ago.”
“Here’s the biggest difference: there was compromise; that wasn’t a dirty word,” she said. “And people were willing to compromise, and join forces, and speak to one another in civil tones both in public and in private, and that has disappeared.”
The alliance working to secure an independent judiciary and educate the public is “fired up” to take on the role in the new year, an energy she doesn’t see in the general government and the Republican majorities.
“I would love to see the Republicans just get a backbone and go back to what I think is morally their responsibility, not just constitutionally, but morally, and they just don’t,” O’Connor said.
She said members of Congress have “abdicated their role in so many areas.”
“I’ve talked to individual congressmen and they say the same thing, that they don’t agree with what’s going on, and my response is, ‘Then do something, stand up, speak out,’” she said.
To that end, O’Connor says she plans to spend the next year of her retirement working to help voters and her colleagues in the judicial system.
“Instead of just complaining, we’re doing something,” she said.

In President Donald Trump’s first term, his Justice Department actively pursued those accused of fraud and corruption.
P.G. Sittenfeld, a rising Democratic star on Cincinnati’s City Council, was charged with taking a bribe in exchange for his support of development deals.
Devon Archer, a financier and corporate board member, was convicted in a scheme to defraud $60 million from a Native American tribal entity.
And Brian Kelsey, a former Republican state senator from Tennessee, was the target of a federal grand jury investigation for illegally funneling nearly $100,000 into his failed congressional campaign.
All three were subsequently sentenced to prison. Theirs are among more than a dozen criminal cases that were investigated or prosecuted in Trump’s first term and then undone, through the president’s clemency power, in his second term.
Trump has railed against what he considers the politicization of the Justice Department under his predecessor Joe Biden, and last week White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said his priority was pardoning people “abused and used” by Biden’s Justice Department. But his actions in these cases show he has tried to undo even the work carried out by his own appointees. No president since Bill Clinton has used clemency to erase his own administration’s prosecutions on such a scale.
What’s more, Sittenfeld, Archer and Kelsey did not qualify for pardons under the standards outlined by the Justice Department, whose Office of the Pardon Attorney reviews applications and forwards its recommendations to the president. Those guidelines require applicants to wait at least five years after their conviction or release from custody, accept responsibility for their crimes, show evidence of rehabilitation and submit a formal petition for review.
The three men met none of those criteria. Their pardons were arranged by them or their lawyers directly with officials in the White House — or, in Archer’s case, after he testified before congressional Republicans in an investigation into Biden’s son Hunter, which Trump said prompted “many people” to ask him to grant the pardon.
“It’s not that he’s correcting another administration’s mistakes,” Doug Berman, an Ohio State University law professor who studies clemency, said of Trump’s second-term pardons of people prosecuted under his first-term Justice Department. “He’s rejecting his own — or more accurately, (he’s rejecting) the work of people he appointed but didn’t fully control.”
Last week, Trump pardoned former Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada and his onetime chief of staff, Cade Cothren, who were convicted by a jury in a kickback scheme. Prosecutors said that the two used a political consulting firm they secretly controlled to funnel state funds to themselves through a sham constituent-mailing program. Attorneys for Casada and Cothren said the men hadn’t done anything illegal but instead made some “rookie errors” that the prosecutors blew out of proportion.
The White House blamed the Biden Justice Department for “significantly over-prosecuting” the pair, pointing to an armed raid and proposed sentences “normally reserved for multimillion dollar fraudsters.” But the FBI raid happened on Jan. 8, 2021, during Trump’s last weeks in office. And though they were indicted in August 2022, while Biden was president, they were convicted in May and sentenced in September. The judge who handed down the sentence was Eli Richardson, another Trump appointee.
A lawyer for Casada declined to comment. Cothren said in a text to ProPublica that although the case against him began and ended while Trump was in office, he had been “targeted by the corrupt, America-last bureaucrats that got held over from Biden’s DOJ — the actual people that should be behind bars for their crimes against this country.”
Taken together, Trump’s actions broke with what legal experts and clemency scholars say is a basic expectation of our presidents: that they stand behind their own prosecutors and law enforcement officers rather than erase or undermine their work and that clemency should be earned, not just granted to allies and public figures with political influence.
“You have to read all of these pardons in connection with the systematic destruction of the Justice Department as an objective agency that seeks to uphold the law and fight crime,” said Frank O. Bowman III, a professor emeritus of law at the University of Missouri who is critical of Trump. Bowman is a former special counsel to the U.S. Sentencing Commission who is writing a book about the history of clemency.
During the president’s first term, the Justice Department functioned as an independent law enforcement agency, Bowman said, though Trump viewed it as a bastion of what he called the deep state. Now, Bowman said, it’s a means to reward friends and punish enemies, as Trump directs Attorney General Pam Bondi to fire prosecutors who refuse to target individuals for prosecution, which she has done.
“He always perceived honest prosecutors and honest cops as his enemies,” Bowman said. “And so he is now proceeding to destroy those institutions.”
Neither the White House nor the Justice Department responded to questions about why Trump had issued pardons to some of his first-term cases or to Bowman’s characterizations. A Justice Department spokesperson said in an email that the agency was committed to “timely and carefully reviewing all applications and making recommendations to the President that are consistent, unbiased, and uphold the rule of law.”
 The Onetime Trump Critic

Sittenfeld hardly seemed like a candidate for Trump’s mercy. In addition to calling the president a demagogue, he had described him as a “buffoonish carnival barker” and a threat to democracy.
From the start, after his 2020 indictment, Sittenfeld insisted that he was the target of a wrongful prosecution and that he never promised official actions in exchange for campaign donations. The U.S. attorney overseeing the case was David DeVillers, a Trump appointee. DeVillers had pursued officials from both parties, leading a broad corruption crackdown that also took down Republican Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder, who is now serving a 20-year federal prison sentence and is also seeking a pardon.
Sittenfeld took $20,000 in donations to a political action committee that he controlled from undercover FBI agents who posed as developers trying to get city approval for a downtown project. In secretly made recordings played at trial, Sittenfeld promised he could “deliver the votes” on Cincinnati’s City Council.
After being pushed out when the Biden administration took office, DeVillers said he hoped the prosecutions helped future officeholders understand that “the idea that you can accept money with a ‘wink, wink, nudge, nudge’ promise to do something” is a federal crime.
A jury convicted Sittenfeld in 2022 on two of the six counts he was charged with: bribery and attempted extortion. He was sentenced in 2023 to 16 months in federal prison. An appeals court panel freed him after less than five months but later voted 2-1 to uphold his conviction, while all three judges urged the Supreme Court to clarify when a campaign contribution becomes a crime.
Lawyers at the well-connected Jones Day firm who handled Sittenfeld’s appeal at no charge were deeply tied to Trump’s world — through his first administration, his Justice Department and now his second-term government.
James Burnham, who argued the appeals, had served in the White House Counsel’s Office and the Justice Department during Trump’s first term. He was a partner at Jones Day when he began representing Sittenfeld, then founded King Street Legal in 2023. In 2025, he spent six months as general counsel for the Department of Government Efficiency before returning to King Street, which boasts “deeper knowledge of the Executive Branch and its current dynamics than virtually any other law firm in Washington, D.C.”
Yaakov Roth, who was also a partner at Jones Day, helped argue Sittenfeld’s appeals too. Roth joined Trump’s second-term Justice Department as principal deputy assistant attorney general in the Civil Division. Noel Francisco, yet another Jones Day partner and Trump’s first-term solicitor general, was brought on to file Sittenfeld’s final appeal to the Supreme Court.
Sittenfeld and his lawyers argued that to prove bribery, prosecutors had to show an explicit deal — that he had agreed to take action for donations. Sittenfeld did no such thing, they argued; he merely expressed that he was “pro-development” and had long supported similar projects.
In a May letter to friends and family, later reported on by the Cincinnati Business Courier, Sittenfeld said Jones Day had a draft of a petition ready to file to the Supreme Court when he learned that Trump had pardoned him. He said he was stunned. “As I now understand it,” he wrote in the letter, “my case came on the radar of the White House counsel’s office and it was advanced for a pardon.”
He did not explain how that happened. Neither he nor his lawyers responded to requests for comment.
Kenneth Parker, the U.S. attorney under Biden who inherited the Sittenfeld case and saw it through to conviction, called the pardon “frustrating and disappointing.”
“I believe, and continue to believe, in the judgment of my prosecutors who did the case, the judgment of the FBI agents who handled the case, and I believe in the judgment of the jury who heard the case,” Parker said in an interview. The president or his aides, Parker added, should’ve consulted the team that prosecuted the case.
Sittenfeld is still pursuing his Supreme Court appeal, saying the conviction carries “collateral consequences” that include a $40,000 fine and damage to his reputation. The government filed a brief Monday supporting his effort.
Trump’s decision to pardon a onetime critic came as a surprise to many and prompted a range of reactions. Vice President JD Vance told USA Today that Trump had put politics aside. Other observers said the case was part of an effort by Trump, himself a convicted felon, to normalize political self-dealing.
“He and his team came to realize that they could turn political corruption into something they deemed fictional and nonexistent,” said David Niven, a political science professor at the University of Cincinnati. “They really have revolutionized the use of the pardon as a weapon, and in this case, as a weapon to erase the concept of political corruption.” The White House did not respond to Niven’s characterization.
 A Witness Against the Bidens

Archer’s case was a particularly stark example of how Trump has used pardons to reward loyalty. In 2016, during President Barack Obama’s final full year in office, prosecutors charged Archer and his partners with persuading the Wakpamni Lake Community Corporation — a tribal entity in South Dakota — to issue more than $60 million in bonds. The money was supposed to fund development projects, but prosecutors said Archer and his partners diverted most of it to pay themselves and cover debts owed to earlier investors.
Andrew Calamari, the former director of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s New York office, who oversaw investigation into Archer and his associates, said in an interview that the loss to investors made it “one of those cases that kind of cries out for action.”
Archer denied wrongdoing and said he was a victim of financial fraud. He was prosecuted at trial and convicted by a jury in 2018, in Trump’s first term. A judge later set aside the conviction, but Trump’s Justice Department appealed the ruling and an appeals court reinstated it in 2020.
Archer had served with Biden’s son Hunter on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, while Biden was vice president. In testimony before House Republicans in 2023, he said that Hunter Biden sometimes put his father on speakerphone during meetings with business associates, though he never heard Joe Biden discuss business deals.
Archer’s appearance made him a cause on the right, as Trump allies and conservative media used his testimony to bolster allegations of corruption by the Bidens and to argue that Joe Biden’s Justice Department was politically biased — pursuing Trump associates while protecting the president’s son. His supporters said prosecutors became more aggressive after he started cooperating with congressional Republicans. Before signing the pardon, Trump said Archer had been “treated very unfairly.” Archer did not respond to requests for comment.
As ProPublica reported, Trump’s pardons in 2025 have erased not only convictions but more than $1 billion in court-ordered restitution. Archer’s case was among those in which victims lost out: He had been ordered to forfeit over $15 million and repay more than $43 million to his victims, in addition to being sentenced to one year and one day in prison.
Calamari, who left the SEC in 2017 and now is a lawyer in private practice, said that the claim Archer had been targeted was “nonsense” and that it was a “bread and butter” fraud case that was “the kind of thing that a Republican or a Democrat would have no trouble bringing.”
He said that when Trump began his flurry of clemency grants, he didn’t worry that Archer would be among the people pardoned because of the gravity of the case. A pardon in a case like this, he said, “undermines any faith in the law.” The White House did not respond to Calamari’s comments.
 Connections to the White House

Like Sittenfeld, Kelsey is an example of someone granted clemency who had a lawyer with close ties to Trump — in his case, the lawyer responsible for advancing pardon requests to the president. That lawyer, David Warrington, a longtime Republican legal strategist who held various legal roles during Trump’s 2016 campaign, later became White House Counsel in Trump’s second term.
Leavitt, Trump’s press secretary, described Warrington’s office as central to advancing pardon requests to the president and Sittenfeld said it was the White House counsel who personally flagged his case for a pardon. Warrington did not respond to requests for comment.
The grand jury investigation that led to Kelsey’s indictment began under Don Cochran, the same Trump-appointed U.S. attorney who oversaw the investigation into Casada and Cothren. The October 2021 indictment accused Kelsey of conspiring to illegally funnel more than $90,000 in state campaign funds into his 2016 congressional race in Tennessee.
The indictment bore the lead signature of Mary Jane Stewart, a career federal prosecutor who’d spent four decades in the Justice Department, serving under U.S. attorneys appointed by presidents of both parties. She was first assistant under Cochran during the Kelsey inquiry and stayed on as acting U.S. attorney after Biden asked Cochran to resign.
Kelsey pleaded guilty in November 2022 to two campaign finance felonies. Four months later, represented by Warrington, he moved to withdraw his plea, saying he’d entered it “with an unsure heart and confused mind.” Warrington’s motion cited the birth of Kelsey’s twins and his father’s declining health, and it argued that the conduct wasn’t criminal.
The judge rejected the motion, ruling that Kelsey had knowingly and voluntarily admitted his guilt.
Kelsey’s new lawyers made a final bid to overturn his conviction. In one claim, they filed affidavits and secret recordings they said showed that prosecutors, after Biden took office, had pressured a witness to implicate Kelsey before the five-year statute of limitations ran out.
Prosecutors dismissed the motion as a “fishing expedition,” noting that Kelsey had already admitted under oath to the facts supporting his conviction.
In an interview, the witness, former Republican state Rep. Jeremy Durham — whose statements Kelsey said proved the case was driven by political pressure — said he was unaware of a partisan motive behind the investigation or of it being a priority for the Biden administration. He said agents told him only that the probe had been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
As for Kelsey’s claim that he was targeted for being a Republican, Durham said, “I wouldn’t buy that” and that Kelsey “needs to beat that drum.”
Still, the claim appeared to resonate where it mattered most. Kelsey’s appeal was still pending in May when Trump granted him a full pardon — just two weeks into his 21-month sentence — and he was released from a prison camp in Kentucky.
The White House said Warrington — who by that time had been named White House counsel and was a central figure in deciding which pardons to advance to the president — played no role. Warrington “was fully recused from the entire process,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in an email.
In a text to ProPublica, Kelsey described that recusal as an obstacle he ultimately overcame when, he said, Trump “recognized this grave injustice for the weaponization that it was.”

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)The fatal shooting in Minneapolis, Minnesota, of Renee Nicole Good by Jonathan Ross, an agent with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, has prompted heated debate and anguish.
With cellphone video documenting the encounter from various perspectives, including that of the ICE agent, one would think that there would be ample evidence for arriving at a preliminary consensus as to what happened. But that’s not the case. Rather than waiting for forensic analysis and a thorough review, many jumped to conclusions as soon as they started watching the videos.
Chief among them was Kristi Noem, director of Homeland Security, who falsely asserted that the shooting victim had plowed her car into federal agents as they were digging out of a snowbank and accused Good of “an act of domestic terrorism.”
Noem’s narrative was soon taken up by Vice President JD Vance, speaking in the press room at the White House, who claimed that Good had been radicalized by leftwing ideology, becoming part of a “lunatic fringe.”
The next day, President Donald Trump called her “a professional troublemaker” and proceeded to confuse her with another person on the scene of the shooting whom he described as “screaming and screaming.”
Noem continued to hold the line on her initial assessment of the situation as she appeared CNN’s State of the Union, four days after the confrontation in Minneapolis.
Host Jake Tapper asked her: “How can you assert, within hours, before any investigation, this is what happened?”
“The facts of the situation are that the vehicle was weaponized and it attacked the law enforcement officer,” Noem responded, continuing to reiterate her original assessment, which remains a point of contention.
The integrity of the investigation has been jeopardized as the FBI takes over and refuses to collaborate with local authorities in Minnesota, who are urging the Trump administration to reconsider that stance.
Speaking on ABC’s “This Week,” U.S. Senator Tina Smith (D-Minnesota) expressed her concern: “How can we trust the federal government to do an objective, unbiased investigation without prejudice when, at the beginning of that investigation, they have already announced exactly what they saw, what they think happened?”
This shooting strikes close to home for us as we learn that the parents of Renee Good live in the small Kansas town of Valley Falls, about 30 miles northeast of Topeka. She stayed with them for a period of time after her husband died about three years ago, before moving on to begin a new chapter of her life in Kansas City.
As I shared an article about Good from the Kansas City Star on my Facebook page, a number of people commenting on the incident put the blame on the victim.
“She shouldn’t of (sic) tried to run someone over,” one wrote. “Play stupid games you get a stupid prize.”
Another chimed in: “Had she not been a paid agitator and not trying to impede law enforcement … she might be alive today.” He added an acronym that others would also deploy: “FAFO” (f*** around and find out). The expression harks back to the speech Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave generals at Quantico in September.
The vast majority of those who left comments on this post were more sympathetic to the shooting victim, but that “FAFO” response indicates that a portion of our fellow citizens are inclined to align themselves with the militaristic machismo expressed by Hegseth and Noem.
Rather than attempting to de-escalate tensions in Minnesota, Noem has sent hundreds more ICE agents, demonstrating the administration’s determination to continue on a path of subjugation and dominance, attempting to normalize the presence of armed federal agents within our communities.
“FEAR NOT, GREAT PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA, THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION AND RECKONING IS COMING!” So exclaims our president on his Truth Social platform, going on to reference “the patriots of ICE.”
Meanwhile, Trump continues to threaten a takeover of Greenland, issues warnings to Iran and refers to himself as the acting president of Venezuela, straining relations with our allies and ignoring the bounds of international law. He says he knows nothing about the Justice Department’s investigation of Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve, as that department continues to slow-roll the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files.
This administration has launched so many assaults on longstanding norms of our nation that we continue to be overwhelmed by the rapid pace of shocking developments that hit us day after day.
We see people taking to the streets in protest, loudly voicing their concerns at gatherings across Kansas, in cities and small towns. But will this be enough to make a difference? Who is in position to apply basic constraints on this rogue regime?
The U.S. Supreme Court has done little to protect us, opting instead to essentially give the president free rein to do whatever he wishes. Lower courts are working, but they move slowly. Congress remains the best hope at this point to start slowing this runaway train down. But the majority party continues, for the most part, to defer to the wishes and whims of its loquacious leader.
U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas did push back recently, in a modest way. In response to Trump’s announced intention of taking over Greenland “one way the other,” Moran provided this short statement, noting that Greenland is an autonomous territory of Denmark.
“There should be no invasion of Greenland,” Moran said. “Denmark is an ally, a NATO ally.”
In a recent op-ed column published in The Wichita Eagle and The Kansas City Star, Gary Blumenthal encouraged the senator to be more principled and courageous. Identifying himself as a former member of the Kansas House, Blumenthal wrote of interactions he had with Moran dating back to the 1980s and 1990s, when Moran was a state senator.
“He was not an ideologue,” Blumenthal recalled. “He was just someone with common sense who happened to get elected.”
As he ends his piece, Blumenthal issues this plea to Moran: “I pray you will become the Republican who speaks the truth out loud. Be the leader who Kansas and the country will remember for choosing principle over party.”
Another way to put it, in honor of someone who briefly lived among us, is simple: “Stand for Good.” She deserves as much, and so do the rest of us.

(Stock photo from Getty Images.)Is public fraud infuriating? Yes.
Is political corruption an insidious, destabilizing debasement of the public trust and the public good? Absolutely.
Should fraud, waste, and abuse be sought out by watchdogs and reporters, and all wrongdoing on the public dime exposed? At every turn.
It’s exactly what I’ve been doing my entire career as a journalist.
Whether it’s covering the petty corruption of a local sheriff, a charter school scam dreamed up on a Waffle House napkin, payday lenders fleecing Ohioans into endless cycles of financial desperation,  or the biggest political bribery scandal in Ohio history, my professional life has been built around exposing and peeling back scandals through fearless reporting for the people.
Holding those in power accountable to the citizens they’re supposed to serve, that’s the job description of any reporter worth a damn.
I worry these days.
I worry that even fraud and public corruption is being politicized in the playhouse of chaos, dishonesty, and misinformation that dominates America’s online discourse.
When clickbait accusations substitute empirical evidence, when wild-eyed conspiracy theory substitutes fact-based reporting, when social media provocateurs masquerade as journalists while following none of the ethical and factual standards of professional reporting, I wonder what happens to a society.
Because here’s the thing: When you don’t follow ethical or factual standards, you’re not a journalist; you’re a propagandist cosplaying as one. You’re a cheerleader twirling and waving your pom-poms, not a referee calling out-of-bounds.
Happens all the time, right? Sure.
But we should be clear about how it degrades our entire system of accountability.
It creates confusion, not clarity. It complicates questions and makes it harder to deliver answers.
It doesn’t faithfully inform or educate, it condescends and manipulates.
It plays people for suckers.
Moreover, false allegations do tangible harm to real people.
That’s the opposite of accountability. It’s injustice.
It can incite people to extreme or violent actions based on careless falsehoods at best, and outright lies at worst.
It’s a moral and ethical abomination, to knowingly be so reckless. It’s a blight on humanity at-large, to say nothing of the stain on the individual.
It also perpetrates a compound injustice by distracting people away from real, factual scandals, in favor of fantastical, unproven, fact-free, alleged scandals.
Fraud, waste, and abuse? It’s happening all the time. National, state, and local levels.
Over-worked, under-paid reporters throughout the country are covering such things on a daily basis.
But their good, honest work often gets drowned out in the cacophony of screaming, fact-free sensationalism.
You know who wins when that happens? The real perpetrators of actual fraud, waste, and abuse.
Finally, it pushes people into camps of unreason, where any possible scandal on the other side is the most heinous crime ever committed upon humanity, and any factual crime committed by the partisan team’s side can be rationalized and excused without a thought or pang of conscience.
This turns many people into partisan-hack hypocrites, defending the indefensible, excusing the inexcusable.
You know who wins when that happens? The corrupt and the lawless, no matter the side, robbing the public blind.
So yes, please, get mad about fraud and corruption — all fraud and corruption — but stick to facts over sensationalism, and never sacrifice your virtue, your honor, or your principles on the altar of mindless partisanship.

(Photo by Maryann Flick/Getty Images)Beals is a visually stunning place, an archipelago ripe with the kind of Instagram-ready seaside and working waterfront scenes that draw summer-long crowds to southern Maine destinations. But dangling like a pendant from the Downeast coast, it’s far closer by distance and tradition to maritime Canada than Portland. 
Driving south over the crest of the Beals Island Bridge reveals much about the community ahead. Modest homes dot Beals’ gently sloping uplands. Fishing piers and wharves jut from the shoreline. Commercial lobster boats and the odd bottom-dragger crowd the mooring fields. During the summer months, pleasure craft powered by either motor or sail are conspicuously absent.
For some towns like Beals, whose economies revolve around heritage fisheries, the growing number of aquaculture leases along Maine’s coast warrants a degree of vigilance and even action. Thirty-three leases were approved in 2025, a 27% increase over the previous five-year average of 24. Since 2022, eight Maine towns have responded by asserting varying degrees of home rule over aquaculture development.
As chair of the Beals select board, Glenda Beal is central to efforts to balance stewardship of heritage fisheries and the environment with the potential benefits of aquaculture. One challenge to that stewardship is what Beal considers the uneven power dynamic in the State of Maine’s centralized system of decision making for aquaculture siting and oversight. 
That system provides Maine Department of Marine Resources with what they consider is exclusive authority to lease submerged lands in coastal waters for scientific research or aquaculture. Marine Resources’ aquaculture lease application review process allows public comment, but it also somewhat constrains notification of hearings and reserves final say in the approval process for the department. In addition, as of June 20, 2025, there is no longer an option to request a public hearing for renewals.  
“The state has been erroneously deciding these things with as minimal amount of local input as possible, and we feel that’s not right,” Beal said.  
Largescale aquaculture operations, usually ones that grow finfish in coastal waters, are what concerns Beal the most because they have a demonstrated potential — if managed incorrectly — to inflict damage to the local environment and undermine traditional maritime uses. The largest operations fall under “standard” aquaculture leases, the most liberal of several types administered by Marine Resources. They allow applicants to establish individual growing areas measuring up to 100 acres each with a total aggregate of 1,000 acres for all leased areas, although the agency may in some cases allow the total to reach up to 1,500 acres.
At the core of Beal’s concerns are lost access to long-fished areas in local waters and pollution from fish waste and uneaten feed — both associated with the 50 acres that Cooke Aquaculture leases from the State to grow pen-raised salmon. Citizens also reported observing other effects of the Canadian multi-national’s leases: seabirds entangled and dying in aquaculture netting, debris washing ashore, cut or dragged lobster trap lines, and navigational hazards like unmarked mooring lines and 30 to 70-foot lengths of derelict tubing bobbing in the tide. 
On January 14, 2025, Conservation Law Foundation filed a 44-page complaint against Cooke in the U.S. District Court in Maine, citing “toxic discharges of fish feces, sea lice, diseases, chemicals, trash, and escaped fish” at 13 Cooke lease sites, including three in and adjacent to Beals’ town limits in Eastern Bay. Each of these three leases also experienced a fish “die-off” event in the summer of 2024 that, according to Beal, left many questions unanswered.
“Cooke never did notify the town about the die-off, which we also found to be unsettling, since they claim to be good neighbors. We found out through fishermen who noticed the dead, floating fish carcasses and all the activity at the pens,” said Beal.
Cooke filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in September 2025 and both parties will present arguments in early 2026. A Cooke Aquaculture spokesperson declined to comment on this story.  
With all this fresh in the minds of local citizens, Beals voters passed an aquaculture ordinance in October that regulates the construction, operation, expansion, and modification of aquaculture facilities in coastal waters. The ordinance also provides a 150-acre maximum limit on aquaculture facilities in the waters surrounding Beals, including subtidal waters where the sea bottom is not exposed during low tide.
Five other Maine towns have enacted ordinances that regulate aquaculture in the subtidal zone: Cutler, Lubec, Penobscot, Waldoboro and Winter Harbor. Cushing has a 180-day aquaculture moratorium in place. . 
The Department of Marine Resources takes issue with town ordinances extending to subtidal  waters. Though the agency did not respond to multiple requests for comment, spokesperson Jeff Nichols told Bangor Daily News in February 2025, “State law is clear. Under state law, the Commissioner of the Department of Marine Resources holds exclusive jurisdiction to lease lands in, on and under the coastal waters”. 
John Duff, professor of Environmental Law and Policy at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, agrees, stating that “while ‘home rule’ is an oft-cited claim by fans of local governance, it is still constrained if, when, and where the state exerts its own authority.” 
Aga Dixon of law firm Drummond Woodsum concludes otherwise. She said the firm, which was commissioned by Protect Maine’s Fishing Heritage Foundation to craft the model aquaculture ordinance used by several towns, “researched whether Maine municipalities have the legal authority to regulate aquaculture, and we concluded that they do — under both their broad ‘home rule’ powers and under state law.” 
As to whether town aquaculture ordinances can legally extend to the subtidal areas of coastal waters, Dixon says, “In short, yes. A municipality can exercise its home rule powers over its geographic territory. For coastal communities, that territory extends three miles out to sea.” 
According to Bangor Daily News, Marine Resources doesn’t plan to take legal action against any towns that adopt aquaculture moratoriums or ordinances. Absent a legal test in the courts enough of a gray area exists to embolden additional municipalities to enact aquaculture ordinances while others will defer to the state’s authority. 
Should towns that have asserted home rule over aquaculture decisions have concerns about the aquaculture industry taking legal action against them? John Delaney, who helped organize Lubec’s successful aquaculture ordinance, doesn’t think so.
“Lubec isn’t demanding anything of the aquaculture industry that they haven’t already promised to do: to be a good neighbor and a good steward of Maine’s coastal waters,” said Delaney. “If they decide to sue the town for holding them to that promise, it will speak volumes about their true intentions.”
In December, Beals held a town vote that amended their month-old ordinance. Reflecting the lack of local capacity in many of Maine’s Downeast coastal towns, the update largely focuses on establishing an Aquaculture Review Committee. Yet, with limited resources available, how Beals and the other towns will manage to execute their new roles in the complicated world of aquaculture review remains uncertain. 
According to Beal, the interest in town ordinances “is not to stop aquaculture but to try to have it in a way that’s fair to heritage fisheries. It needs more oversight at the local level than what the state is able to afford.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-546340905-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-16 04:57:11.277654

We practice where patients need us — from urban hospitals to rural clinics, from the Veterans Health Administration to the front lines of military service.

At a time when healthcare provider shortages are worsening, investing in CRNA education is essential to ensuring safe, accessible, high-quality anesthesia care for surgery, trauma, obstetrics and pain management. Yet a recent federal policy threatens the future of prospective nurse anesthesia students, and by extension, the CRNA workforce in Connecticut and across the country.
Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the U.S. Department of Education established a federal unsubsidized loan cap of $100,000 for graduate students and $200,000 for professional students. As part of this legislation, nurse anesthesia students were classified as graduate students, while physician anesthesia residents were designated as professional students and therefore qualify for twice the amount of federal loan funding.
  This  discrepancy  is inequitable and will have a  profound  effect on our pipeline  of future CRNAs  —  the clinicians  Connecticut and communities across the U.S. rely on every day.  As an educator and  practicing CRNA, I know firsthand  that advanced  education and financial support  are not optional luxuries; they are prerequisites for developing the  expertise  needed to save lives.         
CRNAs must earn a doctoral degree and complete extensive, unpaid clinical training, often exceeding 9,000 clinical hours. During this three-year, full-time academic and clinical commitment, students are unable to work. They rely on federal loans not only for tuition but also for essential cost of living expenses. Yet due to a technicality in the federal policy, nurses are excluded from the “professional student” category, despite meeting or exceeding the educational rigor required by accrediting and licensing bodies. Unlike physician residents, nurse anesthesia residents do not receive Graduate Medical Education (GME) funding; they rely heavily on student loans. Program costs are substantial, and the proposed loan cap would make the profession financially unattainable for many qualified applicants.

  If  the U.S. Department of Education  does not act, the consequences will be severe.  The nation already faces a  critical shortage of more than 9,000 anesthesia providers. Restricting access to CRNA education will deepen this crisis, threatening patient access to essential surgical and procedural care.       
  In  Connecticut, the impact would be immediate and  far-reaching. Programs affiliated with  Central Connecticut State  University (Integrated Anesthesia Associates’ Nurse Anesthesia Program of Hartford and Yale New Haven Hospital School of Nurse Anesthesia)  and Fairfield  University would be at risk for declining enrollment and reduced diversity in the applicant pool.       
During National CRNA Week, January 18-24, policymakers should honor “The Heart of Anesthesia” not just with recognition but with meaningful action. 
  As president of  the  Connecticut Association of Nurse Anesthesiology, I urge federal leaders to update the loan limit  to reflect the  true cost  of  CRNA education. Protecting access to our programs is essential  in  ensuring that  patients, especially  those  in rural and underserved communities, continue to receive safe, high-quality anesthesia care.         
  The future of our workforce and  the well-being of the  patients  we serve  depends  on it.

(Photo by Dave Dildine/WTOP)Maryland will reconsider private funding to help replace the American Legion Bridge, part of a larger agreement aimed at speeding construction of it and replacement of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, officials announced late Thursday.
The agreement was announced after a meeting Thursday afternoon between Gov. Wes Moore (D) and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who has raised concerns recently about the escalating costs of the Key Bridge project, which has gone from an initial estimate of less than $2 billion in 2024 to as much as $5.2 billion today.
“During today’s meeting, we made significant progress,” Moore and Duffy said in a joint statement released last night. “We agreed to accelerate the reconstruction of both the Francis Scott Key Bridge and the American Legion Bridge.”
As part of that agreement for the American Legion Bridge, Moore agreed to “leverage innovative approaches like a public private partnership (P3) that will ensure Maryland, Virginia, and D.C. commuters can soon experience some much needed traffic relief from the most congested corridor in America.”
Key Bridge replacement costs soar as high as $5.2 billion, opening delayed to 2030

It’s a reversal for Moore, who threw out a P3 plan for the bridge that had been pursued by his predecessor, Gov. Larry Hogan, shortly after Moore took office in 2023.
Hogan’s plan was announced in partnership with Virginia, which has made heavy use of privately financed toll roads to widen its portion of the Capital Beltway in recent years. That plan would have widened the bridge from four lanes in each direction to six, part of a larger scheme by Hogan to use toll lanes to widen portions of Interstates 270 and 495.
Shortly after his election in 2022, Moore said he was scrapping Hogan’s plans for the bridge and for private funding. The state has been pursuing federal funding for the project since.
After the collapse of the Key Bridge in 2024, then-President Joe Biden quickly pledged that the federal government would fund 100% of the cost to replace it, and Congress eventually approved a bill promising the level of funding.
While President Donald Trump has threatened funding for the Key Bridge, and Duffy has repeatedly raised questions about its cost and the state’s use of disadvantaged business contracts on the project, state officials have expressed confidence that the law promising full federal funding would hold, and protect the state.
Thursday’s joint announcement did say, without elaboration, that Moore and Duffy had “made significant progress on cost sharing … to ensure fairness” on the Key Bridge. Details on all of Thursday’s announcements are still to be worked out by staff.
Overall, aides said, what could have been a fraught meeting in Washington between the governor and secretary turned out to be amiable and productive.

The event was among the first three allowed under a newly amended state law. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)An Alaska Superior Court judge has ruled that a state law limiting live shows at breweries, distilleries and wineries in Alaska is an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment and the Alaska Constitution’s protections for free speech.
Judge Adolf Zeman issued his decision Wednesday in a two-year-old lawsuit filed by three alcohol manufacturers against the state of Alaska’s alcohol regulator two years ago.
“The speech restrictions fail the tests of strict and intermediate scrutiny, and such suppression of speech by the state cannot stand,” Zeman wrote at the conclusion of his 25-page order. 
Until 2022, alcohol manufacturers were prohibited from having entertainment — including TVs, dancing, games and live music — on site. That year, as part of a sweeping modernization of the state’s alcohol laws, breweries, distilleries and wineries were allowed up to four live events per year if approved by the Alaska Alcohol and Marijuana Control Office, the state regulator.
Bars continued to be allowed an unlimited number of live events without permit; the difference in limits was billed as a political compromise necessary for the reform to pass the Legislature and become law.
Three companies — Zip Kombucha, Sweetgale Meadworks and Cider House, and Grace Ridge Brewing Company — filed suit to overturn the four-event limit, raising free-speech and equal-protection claims.
They were represented in court by a national group, the Pacific Legal Foundation. While the plaintiffs eventually dropped the equal-protection argument, the free-speech debate continued through written arguments.
Zeman ultimately concluded that the state failed to show how restricting live entertainment at breweries and distilleries, but not bars, would protect public health or safety.
“This court recognized that the challenged speech restrictions were once a critical piece of a grand compromise … however, political compromise is not recognized as a substantial government interest for the purposes of restricting speech under the First Amendment. Neither is the codification of preference for one industry actor over another,” he wrote.
While Zeman overturned a law limiting live entertainment, he upheld a law forbidding breweries, distilleries and wineries from having pool tables, dartboards and similar games, “because they are not speech.”
He also gave nodding approval to a law that restricts brewery, distillery and winery operating hours and serving sizes to less than what’s allowed for bars.
“The Legislature has, and can further address public health and safety risks associated with alcohol consumption in breweries and wineries by limiting the amount of product that can be served, the hours during which they can operate, or by reducing the cap for the number of brewery or winery licenses allowed in a given community,” he wrote.
Alaska Cabaret, Hotel, Restaurant & Retailers Association, or CHARR, a trade group representing all kinds of alcohol retailers — including bars and package stores — did not return a request for comment before the reporting deadline for this article.
An appeal to the Alaska Supreme Court is possible by either side. Representatives of the Alaska Alcohol and Marijuana Control Office and the Alaska Department of Law said those agencies were still analyzing the decision.
“AMCO does not have an opinion on the ruling and is discussing the matter with agency legal counsel,” said Jenae Erickson, acting public information officer for the Alaska Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development, the parent agency of AMCO. “At this time, we can’t definitively state how the order will be implemented, or what Alaskans can expect. When AMCO has appropriate guidance, an advisory notice will be released.”
Donna Matias, an attorney with Pacific Legal Foundation who represented the plaintiffs, said she is “really pleased” with the decision and said Alaska limits on live events are “actually very unusual” on a national level.
“It was a political compromise, but the legislature really never had the breweries’ First Amendment rights to use as political bargaining chips,” she said, “and I think the court in this opinion recognizes that very explicitly.”
Lee Ellis, head of the government affairs committee for the Brewers Guild of Alaska, said by phone that the guild had been pushing for a legislative solution to the issue, “but we’re happy to see those entertainment live-music restrictions are finally lifted. I think it’s a win regardless, and we look forward to offering a lot of opportunities for small-time musicians to further present their craft.”
One of those musicians is Juneau singer-songwriter Marian Call, who also works as executive director of MusicAlaska, a group devoted to boosting Alaskan musicians.
Call hosted a Christmas concert in a Juneau distillery before the end of the year, one of four events allowed at that space last year.
She said her group applauds Zeman’s ruling.
“Musicians have a superpower — we can enter an empty room and fill it with people. We create economic activity out of nothing but sound waves. Many businesses benefit from our labor, but none more than restaurants, bars, and the alcohol industry at large,” she said. “Limiting music professionals’ opportunities to work as a part of the SB9 compromise was inappropriate and, as the Superior Court has now ruled, unconstitutional, since musical performance is a form of speech.”
Call said MusicAlaska would love to see Thursday’s ruling bring more music to all kinds of venues — bars, breweries and those that don’t serve alcohol at all.
“Alaskan musicians’ desire and ability to host music events is not a limited resource,” she said, “and the more we get to work, the more Alaskans get to play.”

(Photo by Angela Breck/Maryland Matters)Last month, the Montgomery County Council voted to fill a vacancy created by the  resignation of Councilmember Gabe Albornoz. His resignation seemed timed to avoid a  special election that would have been required if the vacancy had been created with more than a year left in the term.
There are reasons to question whether it makes much sense to maintain a distinction in  the process to fill a seat, such that the seat is filled either by the council or by the voters, all depending on as little as a week or even a day difference in the timing of the vacancy.
There’s a strong case to be made, however, that the council is getting to the right result  regardless. The council narrowed its choice down to three finalists. While it is unclear what  criteria they used in getting that far, they remained firm on one demand they had on each  applicant: The council insisted that applicants would accept the appointment and agree NOT to file as a candidate for a council seat in next year’s primary.
This mirrors what happened in the process to fill former U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s (D-Calif.) seat, when  Gov. Newsom appointed a longtime Silver Spring resident who soon declined to run for  election to the seat the next year.
What if that became the norm for filling ALL vacancies, especially when the timeline is so  short?
While Montgomery County has largely shifted to having special elections to fill council vacancies, the Maryland Constitution still empowers local party central committees to fill any General Assembly vacancies created by the departure of a legislator who was elected as a nominee of that party. The thinking being that the seat  belongs to the party, who should then have the responsibility of selecting the replacement. The governor has the final say, but that has traditionally just been a rubber stamp when  the local central committee sends up just one name.

As a member of the Montgomery County Democratic Central Committee, I have voted to  fill seven seats in Annapolis. I regret that we have this power and responsibility. I think it is  wildly undemocratic, mostly because the new officeholders are given a huge advantage in  the next election. They get to run as incumbents, most often running on a slate with the  other incumbent legislators in that district.
I want local party organs to adopt rules requiring vacancy applicants to do what applicants  for the county council seat just did – to agree to be placeholders, promising not to file as a  candidate for their new seat. District voters could then choose a new representative in the  next primary, without having been force-fed an incumbent they had not elected.
While this  change would rely on a pledge that is not legally enforceable, it could be enforced by voters, who might reject someone who failed to honor the pledge.
In any case, the idea has met great resistance from state party leadership.
What is really needed here is a change at the constitutional level, which would disqualify  new appointees from running in the next primary.
By definition, a constitutional change means there would be no claim to challenge the  validity of the restriction under state law. This change would do what the Montgomery  County Council did with the Albornoz vacancy applications, except that  disqualification would be legally enforceable, rather than just relying on a pledge.
Every year, a bill is introduced to provide for a special election for those appointed in the  first year of a four-year term. This would provide for a special election without the additional  costs of a special election held separately from a statewide primary and general election.  First-year appointees would face voters in the presidential primary cycle, running alone rather than slating alongside other incumbents. Voters would have a stark choice that  doesn’t exist in gubernatorial-year primaries, to vote to return the appointee to fill out the term, or to choose a challenger instead.
Special election legislation could be combined or harmonized with a later constitutional  change to impose the disqualification only on those appointed after the first-year window  for a special election. If the state ever decides to realign the state election cycle to fall in a  presidential year instead, disqualification could just be extended to all appointees.

Right now, housing issues before the Washington state Legislature are getting his attention. 
The company is out with a 10-page report with housing priorities it wants to see lawmakers in Olympia tackle this year. Higher taxes to pay for housing programs are not part of that platform. And Smith rejects the notion that raising taxes on large corporations is a viable pathway to close the state’s affordable housing gap.
Instead, the company’s strategy relies on opening more land for residential development, speeding permitting, driving down material and construction costs, and looking for innovative ways the public and private sectors can work together to get more housing built.
Some of that aligns neatly with legislation lawmakers have floated this year. For instance, Senate Bill 6026 would ban counties and cities from blocking residential construction in commercial or mixed-use zones. Gov. Bob Ferguson requested that bill. Sens. Emily Alvarado, D-West Seattle, and Jessica Bateman, D-Olympia, are lead sponsors.
Smith voiced support for this and other housing measures focused on reducing obstacles to permitting and financing. And he endorsed Ferguson’s proposal to pump $225 million more into the state’s primary account for affordable housing construction.
“You can’t have a healthy company unless you’re in a healthy community. And right now, I think that the affordable housing issue has possibly become one of the most important affordability issues in the state of Washington,” he told the Standard in an interview on Thursday.

There’s another reason that he says he’s taking an interest: “We’ve spent a lot of money.”
Since 2019, the company says it has dished out $750 million in the Puget Sound region, mostly in loans, but also some grants, for low- and middle-income housing and to curb homelessness. Microsoft says the money has helped add or preserve 16,000 homes over the six years.
“I feel that the money was very well spent, but it did not go as far as I would have hoped,” Smith said. “We need to be building 55,000 new units every year in this state,” he added. “Last year, the number of units permitted was only 33,600.”
In the Democratic Party’s progressive camp, there are state lawmakers and activists who argue that companies like Microsoft are not paying enough in taxes. They have ideas about how to overhaul the tax code to change this and generate more dollars for state programs and services.
Take, for example, the payroll tax on large companies that Rep. Shaun Scott, D-Seattle, has proposed. He wants to see the potential revenue flow to areas like education, health care, human services and housing.
Asked about the contention that Microsoft should pay more in taxes to help cover affordable housing, Smith replied, “Higher taxes cannot put even a small dent in this huge problem.”
“We need the kinds of measures that will really energize the private sector, and that means bringing costs down. It means helping permitting go faster,” he said. “I think it’s very clear that that’s where the solution lies, not frankly, a huge amount of more spending by the government.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/seattle-area-housing-1024x706.jpg,,,2026-01-15 21:56:33.826844

(Annie Knox, Utah News Dispatch)Pastors, advocates and Democratic lawmakers called on the state Legislature Thursday to get clear on the money and steps needed to help the state’s homeless find stable housing, including those with severe mental illness, disabilities and substance abuse disorders. 
The group of about 100 chanted and prayed together inside the state Capitol, where lawmakers will convene Tuesday for their annual, seven-week legislative session.  
“Our message is simple: If Utah does not immediately begin making serious efforts to produce the housing and appropriate services to end homelessness, then it will soon be too late to avoid the shame of inviting the world’s elite to visit Utah during the 2034 Olympic Games,” said Levy Woodruff, chair of the governing board of First United Methodist Church in Salt Lake City. 
Woodruff said state leaders have focused their discussions in the last decade on building better homeless shelters, but more attention is needed for resources and affordable housing that can help keep people from losing their homes. 
What Utah lawmakers did — and didn’t — do for housing in 2025

Sen. Nate Blouin, D-Millcreek, said he’s working on a bill that would require the statewide housing analysis advocates are calling for. 
“Utah needs a clear, honest plan for how many homes we need, who they are for and what it will take to get there, especially to protect seniors and people with developmental disabilities from being pushed into homelessness by a cost of living crisis that they did not create,” Blouin said.  
Last year, two legislative proposals sought to provide more affordable housing by requiring cities of more than 65,000 to allow smaller homes and lots. Both failed to pass. 
In a wide-ranging interview this week, Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, told Utah News Dispatch that homelessness is a top priority this year — but he did not commit to a dollar figure. 
“I’ve always said that the goal … isn’t just to house homeless people or find a spot for them. The goal is to try to get them some help,” he said. “We’re committed to try and tackle homelessness, and we’re going to do it the Utah way. We know that housing without treatment is not good.”

Pressed on how much lawmakers will fund for homelessness, Adams said, “The amount of funding, I’m not going to commit to right now. But I think we’ll continue to try to do what we can. We’re committed to that.” 
Adams said he’s a “big fan” of drug courts to encourage people to “either get clean or go to prison.” 
“There’s got to be a combination of all of the above to try to get people in a better spot,” he said.
Gov. Spencer Cox has recommended that lawmakers use $25 million in one-time money and $20 million in ongoing funding for “homelessness and criminal justice high utilizers.” 
He has also said a 1,300-bed proposed homeless campus in northwest Salt Lake City is a top priority for his administration, and is meant to help make Utah a “pilot” state to fulfill President Donald Trump’s executive order titled “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets.” 
Some anti-poverty advocates on Thursday criticized the campus and proposals to use at least some of its beds for civil commitment or forced drug treatment. 
Pastor Brigette Weier, of St. Matthew’s Lutheran Church in Taylorsville, sees it as a return to the “archaic” practice of forcing those with disabilities into segregated settings. Weier said the campus will cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars, but “there’s another cost to our societal soul.”

Melisha Shaner of Magna said she and her daughter spent years in and out of homeless shelters before finding stable housing with help from a project-based voucher program. 
It’s still difficult to make ends meet, said Shaner, with Powerful Moms who Care. As her family has grown, child care costs have made it hard for her and her husband to both work full time. 
Asked by Utah News Dispatch what she wants lawmakers to consider, Shaner said: “Keeping roofs over kids’ heads is the biggest thing.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The University of Nebraska Board of Regents voted unanimously Thursday to proceed with an $800 million deal with Clarkson Regional Health Services to give NU sole ownership of Nebraska Medicine, which officials anticipate will close by June 30.
NU and Clarkson, as well as Nebraska Medicine, will finalize the transaction and craft new governing documents in the meantime. Barring major changes to the plan, approved 7-0, the regents would not need to take another vote. Nonprofit Nebraska Medicine is the hospital, clinical and medical services partner to the University of Nebraska Medical Center.

NU President Jeffrey Gold, who was UNMC chancellor between 2014 and 2024, a role that had him chair the Nebraska Medicine Board of Directors, said the “critically important decision” would allow NU to continue to lead in health care. 
Dr. Gold said his final analysis on the choice came down to his Hippocratic oath 46 years ago. He said the Clarkson transaction was an extension of that oath.
“I said I would heal people, I would do my best, that altruism and humanism and professionalism were key, and that, above all, I swore to do no harm,” Gold said Thursday.
Specifics of the deal
The transaction, plus a promised donation from Clarkson to NU, is as follows:

$500 million for NU to buy out Clarkson’s 50% share of Nebraska Medicine.
$300 million for NU to purchase related Clarkson-area properties.
$200 million that Clarkson pledges to donate to NU for “Project Health” in Omaha, a $2.19 billion endeavor to build up the next generation of health care.

(Courtesy of University of Nebraska Medical Center)
NU will need to raise funds in the meantime, which Gold has said would include debt restructuring and monetization of real estate bought under the agreement. 
The deal comes after NU campuses finalized plans to cut $43 million over the past six months, which Gold said is separate from the Clarkson transaction. Gold and the regents have pledged that no state dollars, tuition or research funds will be diverted to cover the deal.
Responding to State Sen. Rob Clements, chair of the Legislature’s budget-writing Appropriations Committee, Gold said Wednesday: “I do not plan to be knocking on your door asking for dollars on this.”
Competing arguments
That comment came as part of competing Wednesday forums, the other hosted by the Nebraska Medicine Board of Directors, which opposed the transaction. A supermajority of Nebraska’s 49 state senators or their staff members attended one or both forums.
The two events offered, at times, mirror images of the deal and interpretations of contractual language. The Nebraska Medicine board has asserted that its right to negotiate over the future of the nonprofit has not been followed.
“We continue to believe that a more reasoned, viable alternative can be achieved, one that protects Nebraska Medicine’s mission,” the nonprofit said after Thursday’s vote.

NU announced the proposal Jan. 2. NU officials said it came 18 months after Clarkson first approached NU and said it wanted out of the partnership. Clarkson CEO Dr. Bill Lydiatt, a head and neck surgeon, has said the mission of the two entities diverged, so Clarkson began discussing whether to leave in 2022.
Lydiatt told the regents that Clarkson has a vision to make Nebraska the “healthiest state in America.” The initial focus of Clarkson’s new work would be behavioral health and wellness for new moms and babies, as well as building the workforce and talent pool for excellence in health care.
The shares for NU and Clarkson are each valued at more than $900 million and could reach $1 billion by June, Lydiatt said in a Tuesday email to state senators, which NU provided to the Examiner.
The agreement approved Thursday would restrict Clarkson from directly competing with NU for five years after closing, including within a 100-mile radius of Nebraska Medicine, with additional stipulations for the following five years.
Nondisclosure agreements
Part of the timing of this month’s vote was dictated by multiple nondisclosure agreements since July 2024, which officials said kept things quiet until Jan. 2.
Lance Fritz, chair of the Nebraska Medicine board, told lawmakers that the board refused to enter a nondisclosure agreement that would have included conversations the board wasn’t party to.

In August 2025, Fritz said a new agreement only included future conversations, which the Nebraska Medicine board signed. Board members then “begged” to be part of negotiations but had “basically been stiff-armed,” Fritz said. Gold had said the opposite, that Nebraska Medicine negotiators had an “unwillingness” to return requests to connect.
On Dec. 17, Fritz said the board learned of the transaction but still hasn’t had a seat at the table. The board organized opposition to the vote, which led to tension with Gold and the regents.
Fritz said he’s confident the board could find a solution that is less costly, or even of no cost. That includes a replacement partner, he said, if given the chance.
‘Our lawyers say one thing’
Part of the Nebraska Medicine forum also included asking whether lawmakers should get involved with legislation, such as requiring legislative approval for governmental transactions of any “critical asset for the state” to an out-of-state entity above a certain dollar amount.
State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse, an attorney, told Fritz that doing so could pick “winners and losers.” Hallstrom said it sounded as though the deal could be headed to litigation.
“Could be. I understand and don’t disagree with you,” Fritz responded.

State Sen. Rob Dover of Norfolk asked Fritz why he thought NU would become a “bad actor” if it hadn’t before, to which Fritz said he doesn’t label NU as “bad” but as a “wonderful partner.”
“The regents have a duty to the university, not to Nebraska Medicine,” Fritz said. “We have a duty to Nebraska Medicine.”
Regent Tim Clare of Lincoln, addressing some of the tension, said some Nebraska Medicine phrasing that the vote was a “takeover” was “fearful” and “misleading” and caused confusion.
“Our lawyers say one thing, your lawyers say the other,” Clare said.
Regent Paul Kenney of Amherst, chair of the regents board, said Thursday that the vote came on the final day of “exclusivity” talks with Clarkson. Regents were originally set to meet last Friday, but at the request of lawmakers — and Gov. Jim Pillen, according to Kenney — the vote was delayed for more public outreach to taxpayers and other stakeholders.
‘By the taxpayers, for the taxpayers’
Regents largely said the transaction was essential for the state’s health care future, while some cited the risk of Clarkson going to a for-profit or out-of-state entity as a reason to act. Lydiatt told lawmakers that if the deal failed, Clarkson would have sought a different partner.
“We can now rest assured that this entity will be owned by the taxpayers, for the taxpayers, for service to the taxpayers,” said Regent Rob Schafer of Beatrice.

Said Regent Barbara Weitz of Omaha: “This proposal is an appropriate and absolutely essential direction for our university to take.”
Interim UNMC Chancellor Dele Davies gave a similar analysis, arguing NU could not “afford to sit on the sidelines and take the gamble” of an unknown new partner.
Nebraska Medicine board concerns
Speaking with the Nebraska Examiner earlier this week, Fritz said some of his board’s concern is that sole ownership could step on its fiduciary role overseeing the nonprofit. He said at some point in the future, NU’s interests might not align with Nebraska Medicine.
Fritz, as well as a couple of lawmakers, told the Examiner that the “threat” of Clarkson leaving Nebraska seemed more of a “red herring” because of contractual language that Fritz said prevented selling to anyone who either NU or Nebraska Medicine doesn’t approve of.
“We could see our resources either deployed to somewhere other than serious medicine, extraordinary care, or we might have a strategic imperative that we want to execute on, that we can’t fund because the funding isn’t made available to us,” Fritz said.
Regent Jim Scheer of Norfolk. March 20, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Regents tried to assuage those concerns and argue they don’t envision “micromanaging” Nebraska Medicine, noting that hasn’t occurred in the history of the NU-Clarkson partnership dating to 1997.
Regent Jim Scheer of Norfolk said he knows that change is always difficult and that saying “trust me” could appear “somewhat hollow,” but that “you have to trust us until you have noticed that we have not lived up to our end.”
Scheer, a former speaker of the Legislature, said that in his past 45 years of public service, he could count on probably “two fingers” something of this magnitude for Nebraska’s future.
“If I fall over, drop dead tomorrow, I’ll think I’ve done something of major, major importance to the well-being of the State of Nebraska,” Scheer continued.
‘Trying to build a bridge’
UNMC Student Regent Brock Calamari also supported the vote, as did NU’s three other officially nonvoting student regents. Calamari said if regents ever get in the way of evidence-based administration at Nebraska Medicine or interfere with the patient-physician relationship, then voters should hold regents accountable.

“At that point, they can and should be kicked out of office,” Calamari said.
Clare said there are “fences to mend,” and Scheer said he hopes everyone can “take a deep breath, not do something that is going to be inflammatory, that’s going to cause problems for us to try to work together.”
“We’re trying to build a bridge here, and it’s got to come from both sides,” Scheer said.
‘No greater treasure than health’
Gold, too, addressed the tension with state lawmakers. He described some of Nebraska Medicine’s communication to patients as “just heartless and frankly inexplicable to me.”
Interim University of Nebraska Medical Center Chancellor Dele Davies. Jan. 15, 2026. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Fritz and Dr. Michael Ash, the CEO of Nebraska Medicine, told the Examiner they know care won’t be impacted and that the focus on providing world-class care remains.
“I have no concerns there, and there should be zero impact to that,” Ash said.
Ash said that Nebraska Medicine is doing “incredibly well” and pointed to the saying that “if it ain’t broke, don’t try to fix it.”
Davies, UNMC’s chancellor, committed to representing the concerns voiced by Nebraska Medicine’s board and ensuring the “vital” Nebraska nonprofit remains among the very best in the nation: “We [UNMC and Nebraska Medicine] are already virtually the same organization and cannot afford to be divided.
“At the end of the day, there is no greater treasure than health,” Davies continued, “and our responsibility is to protect that treasure for every single Nebraskan.”

On Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge David Carter dismissed a lawsuit by the Department of Justice against California seeking voter information. The Trump administration has demanded that at least 40 states provide unredacted voter data, which can include driver’s license and Social Security numbers. The department has sued 21 states and Washington, D.C., that have refused to provide the data.
Carter, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, called the government’s request “unprecedented and illegal” in a 33-page ruling.
Just a day earlier, U.S. District Court Judge Mustafa Kasubhai said he planned to dismiss a similar lawsuit against Oregon. Kasubhai, an appointee of President Joe Biden, said his final written decision may be different.
“The federal government tried to abuse their power to force me to break my oath of office and hand over your private data,” Oregon Secretary of State Tobias Read said in a statement about the tentative ruling, according to the Oregon Capital Chronicle. “I stood up to them and said no. Now, the court sided with us. Tonight, we proved, once again, we have the power to push back and win.”
Trump’s DOJ offers states confidential deal to remove voters flagged by feds

The Justice Department has framed its demands as necessary to ensure states are properly maintaining their voter rolls. It says it needs the information to ensure ineligible people are kept off rolls and that only citizens are voting. The department is sharing state voter roll information with the Department of Homeland Security in a search for noncitizens, the Trump administration confirmed in September.
While election officials say well-maintained voter rolls are important, President Donald Trump and some of his Republican allies have long promoted baseless claims of widespread voter fraud. 
Democratic election officials have criticized the data requests, calling them an unwarranted attempt by the Trump administration to exercise federal power over elections. Under the U.S. Constitution, states administer elections, though Congress can regulate them.
In arguing for the data, the federal government cited the National Voter Registration Act, the Help America Vote Act and Title III of the Civil Rights Act of 1960, all of which were intended to protect elections and the right to vote. 
In California, Carter ruled that the federal government — and the court — are not authorized to use civil rights legislation “as a tool to forsake the privacy rights of millions of Americans.”
“There cannot be unbridled consolidation of all elections power in the Executive without action from Congress and public debate,” Carter wrote. “This is antithetical to the promise of fair and free elections our country promises and the franchise that civil rights leaders fought and died for.” 
The Justice Department did not immediately say whether it planned to appeal the ruling.

But some lawmakers still have doubts.","Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore) in a file photo from September. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)For the first time, a state board was able to report to lawmakers Thursday it is actively taking steps to bring prescription drug costs down for people on the state health insurance plan – a step that’s been over five years in the making.
But that progress wasn’t enough for several Republican members on the Senate Finance Committee, who continue to be skeptical about whether the Prescription Drug Affordability Board’s actions will actually result in lower out-of-pocket costs for Marylanders.
“That’s an issue that we’ve talked about over and over again in committee here — trying to address what is really the biggest consideration when you look at the cost of prescription drugs,” Senate Minority Leader Steve Hershey (R-Upper Shore) said during the Thursday committee meeting.
His comments followed a committee briefing from PDAB Executive Director Andrew York, who reported that the board is gaining ground on cost reduction for two popular Type 2 diabetes drugs, but those actions are not finalized yet.
“For Farxiga and Jardiance, the board made their preliminary determination that these drugs cause affordability challenges and that then set the process for moving forward,” York said. “And then the final action is probably going to be occurring this spring.”
Formed by 2019 legislation, the board is tasked with bringing prescription drug costs down for Marylanders on the state’s health insurance plan. But various administrative hurdles and a lengthy rulemaking process delayed the board’s work for years.
Maryland board moves to set ceiling on what state will pay for Jardiance, Farxiga

In July 2025, the board selected its first list of prescription drugs to undergo a “cost review” process to determine if the six popular medications were unaffordable to Marylanders, with Farxiga and Jardiance the first to be determined “unaffordable” by the board.
But a longtime concern from opponents of the board, exemplified by Hershey’s comments, is that any cost-reduction efforts that result in saving taxpayer dollars may not result in lower out-of-pocket costs for patients.
“The real concern that we hear all the time is, ‘What are patients paying? What is their out-of-pocket expense?’” Hershey said. “There are some of us that say here that we could get through at the end of this and the patient might not see a penny of savings through the PDAB process.”
It’s not just Republicans who are antsy to see out-of-pocket costs come down.
Sen. Clarence Lam (D-Anne Arundel and Howard) also expressed an interest in ensuring that patients themselves see savings. But he was appreciative of the progress made by the board this year.
“Given all these changes and whatnot, I’m glad to see that the board is now considering action for two of these,” he said.
York conceded that PDAB members have also indicated that the cost-review process is “kind of over-engineered,” and board staff will be looking for ways to streamline the evaluation process over the year to “tighten this process up.”
“We want to get it to an annual cycle,” York said.
Board members have an incentive to move quickly. Legislation from last session would expand the board’s authority out to all Marylanders, not just those on the state health plan.
But to do that, they first have to set what are called upper-payment limits under their current authority, which would mean the state places cap on what it’s willing to pay for those two drugs on the state health plan.
The board’s expanded authority would occur if it placed an upper payment limit on two prescription drugs for a whole year.

The joint Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee first met Wednesday to hear from state economists, industry experts, university professors, and business and farm economists. The committee met again Thursday to consider each members’ estimation and vote on a single projection. 
Members’ fiscal 2027 estimates ranged from $5.56 billion to $6.3 billion, with estimates predicted between 2.8% growth to 5% growth over the previous fiscal year.

House Majority Leader Jason Monks, R-Meridian, made the successful motion to adopt the committee’s median projections for both fiscal years, even though his own individual projection was lower by more than $100 million. 
The committee’s approved prediction was $137 million more than the governor’s projected revenue included in his budget proposal. 
“I do think the governor is pessimistic on where the economy is at,” said Rep. Josh Tanner, R-Eagle, who also serves as co-chair of the budget-writing Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee. “I don’t think the economy is blowing out of the water by any means, but I do think the economy of the state of Idaho, and from all the presentations that this body has heard, is still relatively strong.”

 Economists told committee state likely to see revenue growth level out 

As lawmakers prepare to set the state budget, they must consider factors such as revenue pressures from previous tax cuts, including more than $450 million in approved tax cuts and credits approved last year, economic conditions, and the cost of adopting federal tax changes from the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”  
“There’s not just an economic issue or a taxing issue, there are significant budget issues that you’re going to have to wrestle with this year,” Keith Bybee, Legislative Services Office budget and policy manager, said Wednesday.

On Wednesday, committee members heard from Bybee, an economist with the governor’s office, an economist from Zions Bank, a state labor economist, an Idaho Power economist, economic professors from the state’s three largest universities, a University of Idaho extension professor, the Associated Taxpayers of Idaho and the Idaho State Tax Commission. 
Largely, the speakers said Idaho’s economy remained strong, but that revenues wouldn’t be coming into the state at such a high rate as they were during the pandemic.
Nationally, there was some volatility in the labor market in response to tariffs, according to Zions Bank economist Robert Spendlove. But Idaho was largely immune from that volatility, Idaho State Department of Labor economist Sam Wolkenhauer said. 
“Idaho’s labor market is not showing us signs of distress,” Wolkenhauer said. “It looks very, very healthy.”
He estimated job growth and wage growth will continue to grow, but at a smaller rate. He noted that much of the total income growth was largely driven by income outside of wages, such as from retirement because of an aging population. 
“We’re starting to see much more equilibrium in the indicators, ” Wolkenhauer said, “And so our forecast calls for continued growth in the state, but at rates more consistent with our long-term experience, and not that really overheated growth that we saw in 2022.” 
Boise State University economics lecturer Kyle Brookman, representing a group that also included Karl Geisler from Idaho State University and Steven Peterson from University of Idaho, also suggested a leveling off of employment in Idaho and slowing of revenue growth. 
The university group projected the state would end the current fiscal year with a revenue of $5.4 billion, which is an 8% decrease from the prior fiscal year. They also predicted that the next fiscal year would grow by about 7%, to $5.8 billion.

“We are seeing a revenue decrease, part of that is because we’ve had very high revenue increases in the past,” Brookman said. “So it’s just working off of a base. When you start out high and keep going higher, it’s hard to continue to match that.” 
The Idaho State Tax Commission presented an “optimistic” projection, but it did not include the anticipated impacts of the state conforming its tax code to the changes in the One Big Beautiful Bill. The commission has estimated that the cut to Idaho’s revenue would be between $115 million and $193 million, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Tax Commission Chairman Jeff McCray told lawmakers Wednesday, “we leave that up to you.” 
Legislators will need to vote early in the session on whether to conform to the more than 30 tax changes made in the massive federal budget bill. 
 Some members’ fear projection too high will lead to further budget issues 

Sen. Camille Blaylock, R-Caldwell, made an unsuccessful motion to project much lower revenues than the ones adopted by the committee. 
“If I’ve learned anything from being here in a short year, we spend every dollar that we’re given,” Blaylock said. “I’m surprised that the numbers that we’re looking at are $100 million over what the governor had recommended to us. … If we set this too high, then are projections low like we were last year, then I assume we will be upside down like we are this year.” 
Blaylock proposed setting the current fiscal year revenue at $5.5 billion and the next fiscal year at $5.7 billion, around $100 million less than what was adopted. 
Sen. Kevin Cook, R-Idaho Falls, gave a second to Blaylock’s motion and said he would rather “err on the side of low revenue.” 
The committee never got to Blaylock’s motion because the majority supported Monks’ motion on the higher revenue projection.

In a letter to Noem and Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Rodney Scott, the Nevadans argue that enhanced background checks proposed by DHS for international travelers would further burden the state’s already struggling tourism industry, which has been hobbled by President Donald Trump’s tariffs, the high cost of living, and disturbances and uncertainties accompanying his deportation efforts. 
The proposed rules, primarily affecting the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA), would require international travelers to disclose all social media accounts from the previous five years. The change “would impact nearly every foreign traveler entering the United States and would substantially expand the personal data collected during that process.”
The letter, which is signed by Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto; Sen. Jacky Rosen; Rep. Dina Titus; Rep. Steven Horsford; and, Rep. Susie Lee, asks Noem to rescind and revise the proposed rules with input from local political and industry leaders in order to strike the “appropriate balance between safeguarding national security and preserving the economic vitality of states like Nevada.” 
It’s unknown if Noem, who has been busy defending the aggressive tactics of federal immigration officers in Minneapolis, has responded. 
The travel and tourism industries generate billions of dollars each year, the Nevada officials reminded Noem. 
“In Nevada, where the economy is deeply reliant on domestic and international visitors, even modest changes to travel policies can have outsized economic consequences. Policies affecting the ease, accessibility, and perception of lawful travel must be carefully evaluated to ensure they do not unintentionally undermine the economic stability of states relying heavily on a strong and predictable travel ecosystem,” the letter says. 
The letter notes the delegation supports enhanced “identity verification, threat detection, and border security.” The proposal, however, is a bridge too far – requiring travelers to provide “social media identifiers, to submit telephone numbers used over the previous five years; email addresses used over the previous ten years; detailed personal information about immediate family members – including names, dates and places of birth, residences, and contact information; and expanded biometric identifiers.”
International travel accounts for 12% of all visitation and for 26% of visitor spending in Nevada, the letter says, adding “even small declines in international travel would have an outsized and disproportionate impact on Nevada’s economy.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/101137-01-FAATower___East_Ramp_Control-1744218200-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 20:58:01.621073
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-16 00:54:35+00:00,CT Mirror,"Murphy, DeLauro seeking Homeland Security reforms in funding bill",Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/15/murphy-delauro-seeking-homeland-security-reforms-in-funding-bill/,More Democrats in Congress are looking to condition their support for a DHS funding bill on securing more guardrails for ICE.,"Democrats’ desire to rein in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown has spilled into Congress’ appropriations process as the party weighs whether to stymie efforts to fund the U.S. Department of Homeland Security without some guardrails.
That has put two congressional appropriators from Connecticut — U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro and U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy — at the forefront. They are looking for a compromise DHS funding bill that could include some reforms to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which they’ve criticized in recent weeks.
Congress must pass 12 appropriations bills to fund the federal government and has made a big dent in that work ahead of its Jan. 30 deadline. But the bill to fund Homeland Security remains a major sticking point in the final weeks, and majority Republicans still need votes from key Democrats to get the job done.
The DHS funding bill was already one of the hardest to negotiate. But those challenges got much steeper after the fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis by a federal agent. With renewed frustrations over ICE activity, more Democrats are threatening to withhold funding for the agency absent some reforms or restrictions.
That bill was initially slated to go into an earlier funding package that passed this week but was stripped out when the DHS measure faced headwinds. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., told reporters this week they decided to hold off on taking it up to “buy some time to continue to talk” about Homeland Security.
DeLauro, Murphy and others in charge of the appropriations process are continuing to negotiate DHS funding. DeLauro is the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, and Murphy serves as ranking member of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that specifically deals with DHS funding.
Murphy, who has rallied the base around this issue, said he needs to see “some constraints on the level of lawlessness that’s happening” addressed in any funding bill.
“I know this bill better than any other [funding] bill. I’m trying to be as helpful as I can about ideas on how we can improve it,” Murphy said in a Wednesday interview outside the Senate chamber. “I want to support these appropriations bills, and there’s no question my bar has been a little bit higher than my colleagues’ when it comes to what I need to support the bills.”
The Congressional Progressive Caucus took an official position on DHS funding this week: “Oppose all funding for immigration enforcement in any appropriation bills until meaningful reforms are enacted to end militarized policing practices.”
But Democratic leaders haven’t given their blessing to a strategy on ICE funding. When pressed on Tuesday over whether Democrats will condition such funding, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY., didn’t engage, referring to it as “one of the major issues that the appropriators are confronting right now.”
Some Democrats don’t want to see any new funding, pointing to the additional $75 billion allocated over four years in Republicans’ “big beautiful bill” for expanding ICE’s detention capacity and hiring more officers. That pot of money was much larger than the agency’s past funding through the traditional appropriations process.
House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has pushed back against the idea of cutting funding for immigration enforcement.
“I think there’s a lot of Democrats playing games right now with national security and with law enforcement, and I think it’s dangerous,” Johnson told reporters Wednesday. “I don’t think we need to be cutting funding right now. I think the American people want the law to be enforced, and I think we need to let law enforcement do its job.”
Murphy and DeLauro both say they don’t want to see an increase in money for the enforcement agency and are considering policy riders in the funding bill that could bring some accountability to ICE. Some of those include funding for body cameras, reducing the number of detention beds and requiring agents to take off masks or face coverings, according to a source familiar with negotiations.
One House Republican involved in negotiations on DHS said his party is proposing that some of the funding go toward body cameras for ICE agents, according to Politico.
It’s unclear if that would be enough to win Democrats’ support or if Republicans would make other offers or concessions during DHS negotiations.
A stalemate over DHS funding would not only affect funding for ICE but also the many other agencies it oversees, including TSA, the U.S. Coast Guard and FEMA.
And if they can’t come to an agreement on full-year funding for DHS, Congress may need another short-term measure, known as a continuing resolution or a CR. Some lawmakers caution that a CR could give the Trump administration more latitude over the money compared to a full-year appropriations bill that would direct how the funding can be used.
“Negotiations are ongoing, but I am hopeful we can reach an agreement with congressional Republicans by the Jan. 30 deadline,” DeLauro said in a statement. “Walking away from negotiations only further empowers bad actors within the administration like [DHS Secretary] Kristi Noem and [White House deputy chief of staff for policy] Stephen Miller. Congress can assert itself through this bill and check the administration’s excess.”
“You should demand that we make sure that this appropriations process is used to make ICE comply with the law. And I see a lot of signs out there — not one additional dime for ICE in this budget,” Murphy said Tuesday night at an “ICE Out for Good” rally in Washington, D.C.
Back in the halls of Congress, Murphy acknowledged the challenges that lie ahead for the bill and negotiations.
“Obviously, we’re moving some [funding] bills. I don’t know that I feel optimistic yet about the DHS bill,” Murphy said Wednesday. “We’re not going to fix every terrible thing that’s happening in ICE in this bill. But we should use our power to try to get some provisions that force them to act lawfully, and certainly we can’t agree to an increase in enforcement dollars when they’re swimming in more money than they know what to do with.”
DeLauro has an even bigger task ahead of her on all of the remaining funding bills as one of the “Four Corners,” the four lawmakers that consist of the top Republican and Democrat on both the House and Senate appropriations committees. 
When asked about specifics that could go into a funding bill, DeLauro wouldn’t detail the negotiations. She reiterated that she doesn’t support an increase in funding for ICE.
“We’re in the throes of trying to put that together. Let’s not preempt. Let’s see where we’re going,” DeLauro said in an interview during Tuesday votes just off the House floor. “I want to look at how we put this bill together, that makes sense and addresses the very serious issues that happened in Minneapolis.”
Government shutdown?
DeLauro feels optimistic about the funding process, given they’re more than halfway through passing the 12 full-year spending bills for fiscal year 2026.
“That’s eight of the 12 appropriations bills. I believe on track to pass all 12 bills by Jan. 30,” DeLauro said before Wednesday’s passage of another tranche of funding for the State and Treasury departments. “For me personally, I don’t want to turn over the power of the appropriations committee to any executive, Democrat or Republican. Or the second option is a shutdown, which, as we know, is the worst of all possible outcomes.”
Congressional Republicans similarly feel hopeful about moving the rest of the government funding bills and avoiding a partial government shutdown at the end of January, even with Homeland Security being a thorny issue. There’s little appetite in Congress for another shutdown after a record-long one last fall over a push to extend pandemic-era health care subsidies. Democrats ultimately didn’t get their demands.
“What happens with the other bills is still an open question, but I’m hopeful we can move as many of them across the floor of the House and the Senate and get it to the president’s desk under regular order. That remains to be seen, but Homeland’s obviously the hardest one,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Tuesday.
Aside from seeking to leverage the budget process, Connecticut Democrats are entertaining other ways of enacting some accountability — even some that are largely symbolic, given Democrats’ minimal leverage in Congress as the minority party.
U.S. Rep. John Larson, D-1st District, joined a growing number of House Democrats supporting impeachment efforts against DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. He’s so far the only member of Connecticut’s House delegation to sign on to the effort. As the majority party, Republicans have been able to block other impeachment attempts this session.
One of Larson’s Democratic primary opponents, former Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin, similarly called for Noem’s impeachment. He also said Congress should “condition support for the budget” on securing reforms like banning masks for agents and requiring arrest warrants. And he joined a growing wing of the party that’s called for abolishing and replacing the current structure of ICE.
“When a federal agency is going door to door asking Americans for their papers, profiling people based on their accents or looks, sending masked agents to schools and churches, and repeatedly using excessive force with zero accountability or oversight, it’s time to start over,” Bronin said in a statement on Thursday. “We will still need immigration enforcement, but we do not need and should not keep this agency.”
On the reemergence of calls to abolish ICE among some in the Democratic Party, Murphy isn’t quite going there. 
“Of course you need a domestic enforcement mechanism for the immigration laws of this country. But the way in which ICE is operating today is inhumane and illegal,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
But with little recourse for Democrats in Congress, that has left the appropriations process as the only realistic path for reforming ICE.
“I’m open to hearing it. Congress has congressional oversight which is not happening and if they refuse to sit down at the table and talk to us,” U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District, said as she headed into a House vote on Tuesday. “But this can’t continue the way it’s going.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IndivisibleProtest011326-SR-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 19:56:54.918703

A former Southern Miss player, Picayune native Mo Arnold who last played for the Golden Eagles in the 2023-24 season, is among 20 men charged.
According to an indictment unsealed Thursday, fixers started with two professional games in China before turning their focus to recruiting college players in America to participate in similar point-shaving efforts as recently as January 2025.
The indictment, which includes charges against current and former college players, coincides with multiple NCAA probes into sports-betting violations.

“We were made aware this morning of federal charges brought against a former Southern Miss men’s basketball player as part of a larger sports betting probe,” Southern Miss athletic director Jeremy McClain said in a statement Thursday. “This news is disappointing to everyone associated with Southern Miss athletics. Integrity is important to anyone who loves college sports, and the university stands ready to assist in making sure incidents like these are removed from the competitive space in college athletics.”
Arnold, a point guard, played three seasons at USM, the best being his senior year when he averaged 6.2 points, 2.4 assists and 3.5 rebounds per game. Southern Miss finished 16-16 overall and 9-9 in the Sun Belt Conference that season.  Arnold also started 30 of 33 games in the 2022-23 season during which USM won finished 25-8 and won the Sun Belt regular season championship.
Here’s what to know about the latest case:
The types of bets that were flagged
Gamblers can bet on games with the point spread, a projected total by which one team is favored to win against another team.
Winning a bet on the favorite would mean that team won by more than the projected point spread. A winning bet on the underdog would require that team to win outright or lose by fewer points than the spread.
How this scheme allegedly worked
Prosecutors say players involved could manipulate a game, and therefore the bets related to it, by intentionally underperforming. Gamblers working with those players could then place wagers based on “higher degree of certainty” as to whether a team would cover or fall short of the spread, according to the indictment.

For example, the indictment charges former college and NBA player Antonio Blakeney with taking payments from two high-stakes gamblers to underperform while in the Chinese Basketball Association during the 2022-23 season.
In one such game in March 2023, Blakeney scored roughly 21 points below his scoring average and his team lost by 31. That covered the spread for the favored opponent so fixers could win most of their bets, according to the indictment.
Fixers later recruited college players to help ensure their teams failed to cover the spread either for the first half or an entire game, offering payments typically ranging from $10,000 to $30,000 per game.
The college games that were impacted
According to the indictment, the scheme eventually involved more than 39 players on 17 Division I men’s basketball teams who manipulated or attempted to manipulate 29 games in the 2023-24 and 2024-25 seasons.
Most games were in the regular season and involved teams at the mid-major level, though DePaul in the Big East had three games cited in the indictment (against Georgetown, Butler and St. John’s) from late in the 2023-24 season.
The indictment listed at least four postseason games impacted in March 2024: Robert Morris’ first-round game against Purdue Fort Wayne in the Horizon League Tournament, New Orleans’ second-round game against Lamar in the Southland Conference Tournament, and Abilene Christian’s two games (against Texas A&M-Corpus Christi and Tarleton State) in the CollegeInsider.com Tournament.
Other schools that were affected
Eastern Michigan, Nicholls State, Tulane, Northwestern State, Saint Louis, La Salle, Fordham, Buffalo, North Carolina A&T, Kennesaw State, Coppin State and Alabama State all had players who allegedly impacted games.
Four charged players competed for their current teams within the past week, however allegations against them don’t involve the 2025-26 season.
They are: Kennesaw State’s Simeon Cottle; Eastern Michigan’s Carlos Hart, with allegations tied to a previous stint at New Orleans; Texas Southern’s Oumar Koureissi, tied to his time at Nicholls State; and Delaware State’s Camian Shell, tied to his stop at North Carolina A&T.
Cottle, the preseason pick for Conference USA player of the year, is averaging 20.2 points and had 21 points in Wednesday’s win against Florida International. By Thursday, however, Kennesaw State had released a statement that Cottle was suspended indefinitely from all team activities.
Separately, Eastern Michigan announced Hart’s suspension from team activities pending the outcome of the case. Koureissi — who played for Texas Southern as recently as Saturday — no longer appears on the Tigers’ online roster, while the school responded to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment with a statement saying Koureissi “has been removed from the team.”
Delaware State didn’t immediately return an email from the AP requesting comment Thursday.
In a statement Thursday, Buffalo athletic director Mark Alnutt said the school will continue to cooperate with investigators.
“We believe these to be isolated incidents,” he said, “that in no way reflect the values and core ethics of the Division of Athletics or our men’s basketball program.”
What the NCAA has done about sports-betting concerns
In a statement Thursday, NCAA president Charlie Baker said enforcement staffers from college sports’ governing body have opened sports-betting probes into roughly 40 athletes from 20 schools in the past year.
Eleven athletes from seven schools were ruled permanently ineligible, while 13 others from eight schools failed to fully cooperate in NCAA probes, with none competing today.
News of those cases has dripped out over the past year.

For example, the NCAA banned three players in September for betting on their own games at Fresno State and San Jose State.
In October, the NCAA announced three former Eastern Michigan players refused to cooperate with its investigation. Two of those, Da’Sean Nelson and Jalen Terry, are defendants in the unsealed indictment.
A month later, the NCAA announced sanctions against six more players, a list that included two defendants — former New Orleans players Cedquavious Hunter and Dyquavion Short — from Thursday’s unsealed indictment. Hunter, nicknamed “Dae Dae,” later said on ABC’s “Good Morning America” that he participated in point-shaving.
Later in November, the NCAA ruled former Temple guard Hysier Miller permanently ineligible for placing dozens of bets on Owls games, including some against his team, during the 2022-23 and 2023-24 seasons.
And in December, the NCAA said former San Francisco player Marcus Williams gave information about his stats in upcoming games during the 2024-25 season to a player from another school who was betting on his performances. Williams reached a negotiated settlement to close the case and had no remaining eligibility.

More recent water quality results mean the crowded Wind River Range lake won’t face ‘impaired’ listing, but the improvement also does not clear it of all human health concerns. 
The post After EPA finds chart-topping fecal bacteria in Lonesome Lake, state doesn’t detect E. coli appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming environmental regulators who tested the waters of a crowded and stunning Wind River Range lake last summer did not detect the same worrisome concentrations of fecal bacteria that federal regulators uncovered three years earlier. 
At issue is Lonesome Lake, a 35-acre waterbody at the base of the Cirque of the Towers that generated headlines after the Environmental Protection Agency published its most recent National Lakes Assessment. The western Wyoming backcountry lake contained more Enterococci — a bacteria indicative of fecal matter — than any of the other 981 lakes surveyed randomly around the country. The concentration registered 384 times greater than the EPA’s safety criteria for swimming. 
The concerning one-time test result from a summer 2022 water sample triggered a multi-agency investigation. Last summer, water quality specialists on five occasions made the 20-plus mile roundtrip to and from the headwaters of the North Popo Agie River to take additional tests for E. coli, a more commonly used fecal bacteria marker. On Wednesday, the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality published its results. 
“We’re not showing any indications of public recreation risk, based on our E. coli sample,” said David Waterstreet, the state agency’s watershed protection manager. 
Lonesome Lake was well below the DEQ threshold designed to protect people from getting sick from swimming, he said. 
“Currently, it is meeting that criteria,” he said.

In fact, zero of 10 Lonesome Lake samples had any detectable E. coli. The water was gathered from both the east and southern shorelines in the peak summer backpacking and climbing seasons. 
The complete absence was unexpected and a stark contrast to the results from the EPA’s summer 2022 Enterococci reading, which remains “unexplained” in the view of DEQ surface water monitoring supervisor Jeremy ZumBerge.
“I can’t explain why the value was as high as it was,” ZumBerge said. “Whether that was real or not real remains a bit of a mystery.” 
In some regards, the EPA’s earlier test results were not completely surprising. 
‘Poop Lake’
Lonesome Lake has long had a reputation for being unsafe due to human feces, with some even giving it the moniker Poop Lake. A staffer at Pinedale’s Great Outdoor Shop told WyoFile last summer that his shop advises Wind River Range travelers to steer clear of standing water in the Cirque of the Towers.
“I tell people definitely do not swim in there, I tell people definitely do not drink the water,” Brian Cromack said. “It’s been heavily contaminated for a long time, just via the negligence of outdoor recreation enthusiasts over the years.”

Seated at between 10,000 and 13,000 feet in the Shoshone National Forest, the Cirque of the Towers and its Lonesome Lake have long been among the most visited destinations in the Winds. There’s a camping prohibition within a quarter mile of the shoreline due to crowding, and a trail counter shows that use crests at 400 visitors a week during the peak summer. Many of the backpackers, climbers, dogs and livestock using the basin have to go poop while traveling through the cirque’s small, 2-square-mile watershed. 
“There’s a longstanding view that there potentially are water quality issues there due to the amount of recreation in the area,” ZumBerge said.

(Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile)
Shoshone National Forest spokesman Evan Guzik reiterated the point. 
“Considering the historical anecdotal reports and elevated Enterococci from 2022, visitors should continue to use caution when recreating in Lonesome Lake or using it as a drinking water source,” Guzik said. 
No corroboration
But at least for now, the DEQ has not found any data corroborating the human health hazard. 
Wyoming water quality specialists would typically proceed to their next sampling target if they don’t detect a pollutant in the first year of looking, but they’re considering replicating their efforts in summer 2026 because of the public interest in Lonesome Lake. 
“It’s not an easy undertaking — 20-mile day hikes — to get samples,” ZumBerge said. “We discussed whether the effort was really worth it, but … we are seriously evaluating doing this again.” 
Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality staffers who sampled Lonesome Lake five times in 2025 also sampled Big Sandy Lake, another highly trafficked waterbody on the opposite side of the Continental Divide. They again detected no E. coli. 
There are flowing waters in the region that contain unsafe concentrations of E. coli, however.

Lander Creek, just to the southwest, has long suffered from a feces-related impairment, though DEQ has proposed to reclassify and delist the Wind River Range stream. A 14-mile stretch of the Sweetwater River has also been tagged as unfit for immersive recreation because of bacteria that could make swimmers sick. 
“Our monitoring targets both reservoirs and rivers and streams,” said Waterstreet, DEQ’s watershed protection manager. “Over the history of evaluating different types of waters, we typically find E. coli pathogens more often when we’re in a stream network.”

A lawsuit filed this week challenges a decision by the Bureau of Land Management and the Dillon Field Office to use prescribed burns and other conservation techniques on tens of thousands of acres of land, but fails to say when, where and how those will be applied, as well as cuts out any public comment and review.
Alliance for the Wild Rockies, Native Ecosystems Council, the Council Wildlife and Fish as well as the Western Watersheds project have filed suit in the Butte division of the federal court system, asking the court to halt the project because it falls short of federal law, and includes so little detail that it’s impossible to understand the plan. The groups also raised concerns about several species that reside in the area, including the sage grouse, pygmy rabbits and pinyon jays.
The Bureau of Land Management has a standing policy of not commenting on pending litigation.
The “vegetation management treatments” could span across multiple mountain ranges in southwestern Montana and include prescribed burns. That area encompasses 905,000 acres of land.
“BLM authorized the project without determining where and when which activities will take place,” the lawsuit said. “The precise location, timing and scope of these land-disturbing activities will be decided at the implementation stage … without any further opportunity for public comment. In some cases, those decisions will be made without additional review of the underlying environmental analysis, even though the analysis of baseline conditions is more than a decade old and missing key baseline information.”
Instead, the lawsuit said that the BLM will then “backfill” data only after the project is approved and even then, that information will not be subject to public comment.
The suit claims that the federal agency has planned this “in a way that undermines informed decision-making and meaningful public participation,” which the groups allege is a violation of the National Environmental Policy Act and the Federal Land Policy Management Act.
The lawsuit also says that the scope of this proposed project is so large and so wide that it is impossible to evaluate the impact on “special status species” — those endangered or protected by federal law.
It also claims that the BLM is failing to take into account why some of the land has been degraded — because of livestock grazing.
“The assessment report have identified livestock grazing as a significant causal factor for certain watersheds not meeting rangeland health standards,” the lawsuit said. “For instance, in one area of the Grasshopper Watershed, the riparian health and water quality standards were not met because livestock has caused a wetland area to dry out.”
The organizations told the court that because they have not taken into account grazing or even established a baseline, it will be impossible to tell what role the grazing has on the rest of the ecosystem.
The groups offer opinions from the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court, which oversees Montana’s federal courts, including a 2016 decision that says without establishing the baseline conditions before a project begins, there’s no way to comply with federal policy. The lawsuit also said federal law requires data, explanations and conclusions that are subject to both public review and a court review before beginning action.
The plan calls for “deforestation” of conifers including Douglas fir and Rocky Mountain Juniper from historically non-forested areas, and authorizes 10,000 acres per year for prescribed burns or mechanical removal, including cutting or mulching trees.
“The available scientific evidence — as well as BLM’s own planning materials — indicates a high potential for harm from mechanical conifer removal and prescribed fire,” the lawsuit said. “For instance, one of the most common outcomes of mechanical junior and sagebrush removal is an increase in invasive annual grasses, which in turn increase fire risk and degrade native ecosystems.”
The lawsuit also faults the BLM for not explaining how it will achieve these plans, and any of the steps the agency will take to protect habitat, especially for sage grouse, pinyon jays and pygmy rabbits, the smallest wild rabbits in the world.
The conservation organizations also describe populations of wildlife that are falling in the Dillon Field Office area. It includes a sage group population that has shrunk 30% since 2021 and has been cut in half since 2002 in Montana. Pygmy rabbit populations have crashed in the past 50 years, with half of the numbers declining due to habitat loss, according to the lawsuit.
Pinyon Jays, small to medium sized blue jays that live in the West, have also seen their numbers reduced by 80% because of changes to the environment, including elimination of juniper habitats, which the birds depend upon for seed caching, foraging and nesting.
It also calls into question whether whitebark pine, a species on the Endangered Species List, is going to be affected.
“Without such surveys, the BLM cannot know the baseline status of the species, (and) cannot seriously analyze the impacts of the project on whitebark pine,” the lawsuit states.
The lawsuit asks that court to halt the decision, require the BLM to complete an environmental impact statement for the project, or at least supplement an environmental analysis that addresses the deficiencies.
“This area contains some of the best habitat for sage grouse in Montana and the Northern Rockies,” said Mike Garrity, the executive director for the Alliance for the Wild Rockies. “Yet the BLM wants to burn down sagebrush to promote even more widespread grazing.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Dillon-Field-Office-1024x370.jpg,,,2026-01-15 19:56:54.918703

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
After perhaps the most intense vote-whipping he’s done as House speaker, Republican Jason White prevailed on a major school-choice bill, but only by a razor-thin, two-vote margin, with the future of the legislation uncertain. 
Despite the heavy lifting and House Bill 2’s passage after a four-hour debate, the final vote count could have been tied if every member had voted. 
The 122-member House passed the school-choice bill by a vote of 61-59. Fifty-nine Republicans and the chamber’s two independents voted for the measure. Seventeen Republicans, though, joined all of the chamber’s 42 Democrats to oppose it.
Two House members — Republicans Price Wallace of Mendenhall and Clay Deweese of Oxford — did not vote. 
Deweese was marked present on the House’s roll for the day. Wallace was marked absent. 
After the House concluded its four-hour debate on the school choice bill, Deweese, as chairman of the Appropriations C Committee, immediately presided over a roughly hour-long budget hearing to hear testimony from the Division of Medicaid. 
After the committee meeting, Deweese told Mississippi Today that he was “unavailable” to vote on the school choice bill. When asked why he was unavailable, he didn’t answer the question and walked off into a suite of legislative offices where the public isn’t allowed. 
He did not respond to a separate follow-up question asking how he would have voted on the measure if he were available. 
A legislative tactic that lawmakers can deploy is what’s commonly called “taking a walk,” or leaving the chamber and not voting on a bill. Often, this is a way to avoid drawing the wrath of legislative leadership or voters back home.
The two-term lawmaker represents Lafayette County, which contains two A-rated school districts. Oxford School District Superintendent Bradley Robertson penned an opinion essay for Mississippi Today in October arguing against school-choice legislation. 
Wallace, on the other hand, was not seen at the Capitol on Thursday and was marked absent on the roll. Wallace, a farmer, later told Mississippi Today that he didn’t take a walk. He was repairing some broken farm equipment and could even supply a picture of what he was trying to fix. 
Wallace said if he had been present at the Capitol, he would have voted against the school-choice measure. 
Whenever a speaker puts their full weight behind a policy, it’s long been the realpolitik that House members can gain the speaker’s favor by voting with the leader. Voting against a speaker can get a member demoted, or back-benched or make it difficult to pass their own legislation. 
In the Mississippi House, the speaker wields enormous influence by helping control which bills die and which ones become law. He also decides which members lead committees and can remove them as leaders.
Last year, White removed Rep. Stacey Hobgood-Wilkes, a Republican from Picayune, as the leader of the House Drug Policy Committee.
White never said why he yanked her from the committee, but the Pearl River County lawmaker said it was because she pushed back against White over disagreements on legislation that sought to regulate pharmacy benefit managers. 
While the House debated the lengthy bill on Thursday, Senate Education Chairman Dennis DeBar, a Republican, told Mississippi Today the Senate still doesn’t have the votes to pass a robust school choice package, as the House is pushing.
He also alluded to moves by House Republican leaders to finagle over votes in Wednesday’s committee meeting, such as asking some members to skip the meeting instead of voting no.
“The Senate position is what we passed, and I’m going to support the Senate position,” DeBar said. “I’ve got votes on a single bill, I’m not twisting arms or asking people to walk. I’ve got the full support of the Senate. When the House bill gets here, if it gets here, we’ll deal with it in due course.”
After the vote, White told reporters that he is not pressuring House members to vote a certain way and said arm-twisting was something previous House speakers would do.
“I think pressure comes to bear from voters and politics, not from a heavy hand in leadership,” White said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/15143412/3X0A7377.jpg,,,2026-01-15 19:56:54.918703

Jared Polis delivers his final State of the State address in the House chamber of Colorado Capitol in Denver on Thursday. (Photo by Hyoung Chang/The Denver Post)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis delivered his final State of the State speech to the Legislature on Thursday morning, simultaneously taking a victory lap for his two terms in office and laying out his priorities for this year’s lawmaking session.
His 82-minute address covered the strides his administration made in housing, education, health care and the environment. As he spoke in front of a House chamber packed with lawmakers and state officials, his husband, child, parents, sister and dog, Gia, sat in the front row.
Among achievements he touted were the establishment of universal preschool in the state, the Sundance Film Festival’s upcoming move to Boulder, the elimination of a budget gap for public schools, housing affordability policies and the cutting of the state’s income tax rate.
“When it comes to turning my bold agenda into a better daily life for Coloradans, we haven’t always succeeded on our first try,” he said. “But we’ve always stepped back up to the plate, because that’s what we do in Colorado.”
“The state of our state is strong,” he said. “Resilient, loving, kind, innovative, free and ever bright with the promise of a Colorado for all.”

Polis blasted the tenor of politics in Washington, D.C., and the decisions of the Trump administration when it comes to tariff policy and withholding federal dollars to the state. He said that while the state has defended about $900 million through the courts, there is still $1 billion lost or at risk from “illegal Trump administration cuts.”
Text of Gov. Jared Polis’ 2026 State of the State address

“Washington Republicans, once the self-proclaimed party of states’ rights and small government, today are too often the party of socialism, overreach and intrusion into people’s daily lives in ways wholly out of the scope of government,” he said.
He also criticized Trump’s recent veto of a bipartisan bill to fund the Arkansas Valley Conduit project, which is planned to deliver clean water to cities east of Pueblo, and his denial of disaster relief funding for wildfires and flooding.
Polis, who is term-limited, said he hopes his “commitment to a compassionate, kind Colorado for everyone” will continue beyond his tenure as governor. Voters will choose his replacement this fall, and two heavyweight Democrats — Attorney General Phil Weiser and U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet — are running for the seat. Whoever wins the Democratic primary election is likely to win the general election.
“In words and actions, we must reject the politics of division and the poison of blind hatred by doubling down on respect, kindness, compassion and truly learn to disagree better,” he said.
The Trump administration’s “costly and cruel immigration agenda is not the Colorado way,” he said, noting that the majority of immigrants in detention centers do not have criminal convictions. In his address to lawmakers last year, he said he welcomed detention and deportation against immigrants with violent and dangerous criminal histories, but that was before Trump’s mass deportation effort began.
“In our Colorado for all, we welcome immigrants and refugees who follow our laws and seek to build a better life here, who strengthen our economy and enrich our communities under the shelter of our democracy,” he said.
Housing agenda
Polis is once again hoping the Legislature can pass land use and housing policy that would encourage more residential construction and ease the development process. It has been a major theme for him, especially since winning reelection in 2022. Addressing the state’s housing shortage has been a major theme for him, especially since winning reelection in 2022. A state analysis last year estimated Colorado has a shortfall of more than 100,000 homes, which leads to escalating costs.
In previous years, he has signed laws that automatically allow accessory dwelling units on many properties, alter the construction defect liability statute, ease the construction of modular housing and authorize a single staircase in apartment buildings.

This year, he wants to give local governments resources to build housing near transit and also improve local bus and train stations. He also gave a shout-out to a bill that would let schools, transit agencies and certain nonprofits build housing on unused land they own. A similar bill that also would have included faith organizations like churches did not pass last year.
“We so often hear folks saying ‘Yes we need more housing, but it needs to be affordable,’” said Rep. Andrew Boesenecker, a Fort Collins Democrat running this year’s bill, said Thursday at the Capitol. “What we’ve done this year is really prioritize those pieces to empower nonprofits or public housing authorities to utilize the administrative review process to build housing at a process that is faster.”
Rising Medicaid costs
Polis doubled down on his pitch to sell Pinnacol Assurance, the state’s worker compensation insurer, in order to raise funds for programs at risk during a tight budget year, such as the senior homestead exemption. Lawmakers did not go for the privatization plan last year.
On health care, he emphasized that Colorado cannot afford to grow its Medicaid program at its current rate. The program is a primary driver in the state’s budget shortfall. Since last year’s legislative session Polis tapped a consulting agency to study the state’s strategy and suggest policy ideas to ease the fiscal burden. He also wants lawmakers to raise the Medicaid budget next fiscal year by less that it needs to maintain current service.

“The reality is that health care expenses are rising far faster than the rest of our budget,” he said. “We must take action to bring Medicaid costs to a sustainable level and protect access for the 1.2 million Coloradans who rely on Medicaid.”
At the same time, he said states cannot solve the problem on their own, and he called for Congress to work towards a structural change to the nation’s health care system, such as a social insurance model like the proposed Medicare for All.
Declines to answer Tina Peters questions
Regarding the state’s environmental policy, Polis reaffirmed his commitment to achieving 100% clean energy, and he said emerging technologies will need to be considered to meet environmental goals. Colorado did not meet its greenhouse gas emission goal at the end of last year. Polis tied climate issues with transit needs.
“We’ve made progress, but the reality is that until we have a world-class metro-area transit agency, we cannot meet our climate or affordability goals,” he said. “This begins with governance changes, increased accountability and transparency and a stronger partnership between the cities it serves and the transit agency.”
Polis finished his final speech at the Capitol by encouraging lawmakers to pass bills they know he will agree with, such as lowering the state income tax and supporting cryptocurrencies. He vetoed a personal record-setting 11 bills last session, and he joked about handing out commemorative veto pens to bill sponsors.
“On issues you know I disagree with you on, let’s work together to find agreement,” he said.
One topic Polis did not mention during his address was whether he is considering granting clemency to Tina Peters, the former Mesa County clerk convicted of felonies related to a breach of the security of her election system. He told CBS News last week that Peters’ nine-year sentence is “harsh.” Trump has repeatedly called for Peters’ release from state prison and even issued her a pardon, despite not having the power to forgive state-level convictions.
Polis repeatedly declined to answer reporters’ questions after his speech about whether he has spoken with the Trump administration about a pardon or sentence reduction for Peters. He did say he had not spoken with the administration about releasing Peters in exchange for something else.
“There’s so many people who have opinions on clemency, but I’m the one who decides and weighs the actual factors in the crime and sentence,” he said.
House Minority Leader Jarvis Caldwell, a Colorado Springs Republican, said the speech’s tone was misaligned with the everyday experience of Coloradans. Polis made repeated pop-culture references, as he often does, and the overall mood was retrospective and celebratory.
“We hear farmers and ranchers mentioned two times in the whole speech, but Taylor Swift getting mentioned three times. Our constituents aren’t OK with that,” he said. “They see the governor making jokes while they’re struggling to pay bills, they can’t afford their utilities and they’re losing their jobs. They don’t find it funny.”

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — South Dakota lawmakers voted to recognize the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, but not before adjusting language on Indigenous people and civil rights leaders in the text of the nonbinding resolution.
Identical resolutions on the anniversary appeared on the floor of the state Senate and House of Representatives at the same time Thursday. 
In its original form, the resolution included language saying that “indigenous nations, generations of immigrants, civil rights advocates, and countless others have worked tirelessly to promote and protect freedom and justice for all, and to create, based on those principles, the United States we recognize today.”

The terms “indigenous nations” and “civil rights advocates” did not survive.
Brookings Republican Tim Reed was the prime sponsor of the resolution in the Senate.
Piedmont Republican John Carley introduced an amendment to change “generations of immigrants, civil rights advocates, and countless others” to “generations of natural-born Americans and immigrants.”
Carley said the change “moves the narrow recognition” of those who contributed to the success of the U.S. to “a broader group of people who have also worked tirelessly, and still incorporates those that were singled out.”
The amendment passed on an 18-15 vote. Among the supportive votes was one from Sen. Red Dawn Foster, a Democrat and tribal member from the Pine Ridge Reservation. The amended resolution passed 33-0, with two senators excused.
Rep. Phil Jensen, R-Rapid City, introduced the same amendment to the House version of the resolution.

Rep. Kadyn Wittman, D-Sioux Falls, was the resolution’s prime House sponsor. She said the change would strip meaningful recognition from those who’d contributed to the nation’s success. 
“This resolution is supposed to be a moment of unity, but unity is not forged through erasure,” she said.
Rapid City Republican Rep. Peri Pourier, who left the Democratic Party in September, backed the amendment. The Oglala Sioux Tribe member disagreed with Wittman’s characterization of the amendment as “erasure” of Native Americans from the resolution’s verbiage.
As amended, the sentence in question still used the words “natural-born Americans.”
All tribal members “are natural-born Americans,” Pourier said, “and we did contribute to the rise of this nation.”
The original version of the resolution in both chambers also said “the tribal nations within this state’s borders, as well as this state’s pioneer heritage, agricultural innovations, and its resilient civil spirit contributed to the growth of this incredible nation, and will continue to support the United States of America for many years yet to come.”

The reference to continued support from tribal nations struck Pourier as an attack on tribal sovereignty. 
“It is not the role of the state of South Dakota to mandate tribal nations to do anything. Tribal nations are sovereign nations,” she said.
That issue came up in the Senate, as well. Senators voted to remove the verbiage in an amendment, separate from Carley’s and sponsored by Foster, that was never introduced on the House side.
That Senate amendment removed the words “will continue to support the United States of America for many years yet to come.”
The House’s resolution garnered “no” votes from the House’s five Democratic members. Pourier ultimately supported the resolution.

Linda Serrato (D-Santa Fe) introduced proposed legislation regulating the use of AI during a Jan. 15, 2026, news conference in Albuquerque. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)New Mexico’s top prosecutor is joining one lawmaker to propose legislation they say will rein in deepfakes and other AI content that can lead to harassment and exploitation.
In a news conference Thursday, Attorney General Raúl Torrez noted the Jan. 13 arrest of Albuquerque man Richard Gallagher, whom prosecutors accused of manufacturing child pornography using AI to manipulate innocuous photos into sexually explicit images.
During the news conference, Torrez said Gallagher’s case marked the first of its kind in the state, but should serve as a “wake up call” about the need for accountability and governance around the use of AI to create such content.
“Because of that rising threat to members of our community and to our society, I think it’s important for New Mexico to take a leading role in trying to develop a framework that sets clear guidelines and boundaries for the ethical development of this technology and the ethical use of this technology,” Torrez said.
Rep. Linda Serrato (D-Santa Fe) who will sponsor the bill in the legislative session starting Jan. 20 said she believes in AI’s beneficial uses, but said the state has to “root out bad actors” and hold them accountable.
“We are promoting responsible AI, transparency and responsibility — that is core to what that is,” she said. “And if you fail to do that, there are real penalties that take place.”
While the bill has not yet been filed, according to an NMDOJ fact sheet, it’s intended to address the “rapid growth of malicious ‘deepfakes” — aka altered images and other media — by requiring clear labeling; specifying remedies for victims of deepfake harassment, defamation, exportation or exploitation; and creating state-level accountability for large AI providers.
The bill would create civil penalties up to $15,000 against tech companies that don’t comply with the technical requirements of the law, and also allow individuals harmed by deepfake images the right to sue anyone who creates or “knowingly and recklessly disseminates” such AI content for actual damages, or up to $1,000 per view, whichever is more.
“That’s a steep and heavy price to pay,” Torrez said, “but I think it is in line with the type of harm and a necessary deterrent for making sure that this activity is not in any way allowed.”
Finally, using “synthetic” images, audio and video in the commission of a felony — Torrez listed examples such as fraud, elevated stalking and extortion — would allow prosecutors to enhance the sentence and add one additional year of imprisonment. The fact sheet defines synthetic content as that which “realistically depicts someone doing something they never did, without their consent and would be believed as authentic by a reasonable person.”
Torrez said the state was prepared to fend off any litigation from the federal government to possibly ban states from imposing their own laws on AI companies, including President Donald Trump’s recently drafted executive order.
“Most Americans, including a lot of people who voted for the president, are profoundly uncomfortable with a hands-off approach with this,” Torrez said. “I think that will help us not only pass the legislation but will inform any litigation that we are forced to undertake in its defense.”

We need a mix of public and independent schools to meet students’ diverse needs.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Kayce Bradley: Stop attacking our independent schools.","This commentary is by Kayce Bradley, who lives in Concord. She has two sons and is an independent hairstylist.  



This past December, my son Cody packed his bags for Michigan to begin a specialized welding program. He has found a career path he is passionate about and is confident in his skills after earning a high school diploma with high honors.
If you had seen him several years ago, before he started high school at St. Johnsbury Academy, you might not have believed this future was possible.
As the parent of a child who had special education needs, I learned the hard way that no single school model works for every student. 
Education is not a monolith, and neither are our children. Vermont is currently engaged in a necessary debate over education reform, and I welcome that conversation. 
However, what I cannot welcome — and what compels me to speak out — is the argument pushed by advocates who insist that public schools are the only legitimate option.
They want families in tuitioning districts without their own public schools to be stopped from using public tuition dollars to send their children to independent schools. Sadly, this effort is often built on arguments that are not just misguided but harmful to families like mine.
The most offensive narrative to me is the claim that independent schools discriminate against students with disabilities or only accept the best students while leaving others behind. My family’s experience proves the exact opposite.
Before high school, Cody attended a public school. He struggled with reading and consistently scored low grades, barely passing. In that environment, he wasn’t thriving; he was just there. As Cody described it, he felt like they “kind of just sat me in a room” and gave him worksheets, but didn’t focus on him as a person. We felt left behind.
When we used school choice to send him to St. Johnsbury Academy, the difference was immediate. They didn’t turn him away. He was welcomed wholeheartedly. 
They sat down with us, went over his education plan, and ensured he had access to a multitiered literacy program. It wasn’t a generic fix; it was two or three students with one teacher, working intensively for an hour a day.
The results speak for themselves. The boy who was barely passing in middle school was on the honor roll or high honor roll for all four years of high school. He flourished not because the standards were lower, but because the support was real.
For Cody, this meant learning from instructors in culinary arts and welding, programs that engaged him and gave him a reason to love school. Those programs, and the teachers who led them, are the direct reason he is pursuing a career in welding today.
If independent schools were the unaccountable, discriminatory institutions critics suggest, my son would have fallen through the cracks. Instead, he was lifted up.
Under Act 173, schools receiving public funds cannot turn students away without just cause. Discrimination against students with disabilities is illegal — full stop. 
St. Johnsbury Academy and Vermont’s independent schools are approved and regulated under the State Board of Education’s 2200 rule series. It’s a framework nearly twice as long as the standards governing public schools. The idea that these schools are the Wild West of education is a myth.
Finally, there are the administrative arguments: that tuitioning funnels money to discriminatory religious institutions. 
This is demonstrably false. The Legislature has already solved this. Under Act 73, just 18 independent schools in Vermont remain eligible for public tuitioning and none of them are religious. All of them follow Vermont’s strict anti-discrimination laws.
I support Vermont’s public schools. I want them to succeed. But I also know that our state’s education system has long relied on a healthy mix of public and independent options to meet the needs of diverse communities.
I have another child graduating from eighth grade soon, and we are looking forward to him having the same opportunities Cody did. Families like mine should not be punished because some advocates are intent on creating a false narrative to limit our choices.
Vermonters deserve an honest conversation about education, not one built on fear and distortion. 
For my child, the environment where he could thrive, where he went from “stuck in a room” to a high honors graduate with a bright future, happened to be an independent school. 
Vermont’s tuitioning system made that possible. Don’t tear it down based on claims that simply aren’t true.

We are falling behind in ways that directly affect how people live, work and raise families.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Loralee Tester: Kindness can’t fix a state in crisis.","This commentary is by Loralee Tester, the executive director of the Northeast Kingdom Chamber of Commerce.



Vermonters are, without question, some of the most well-meaning people you will ever meet. We shovel each other out after snowstorms. We show up with casseroles. 
We volunteer, donate, coach and serve on boards — sometimes four or five or more. We respond when help is needed, not because we have to, but because it is who we are.
That generosity is one of Vermont’s greatest strengths. But kindness alone is not going to fix a state in crisis.
It is time for us to face an economic reality that no amount of goodwill can fix. The Vermont Futures Project recently released its Competitiveness Dashboard, an honest, data-driven look at how our state is performing across key indicators, from affordability to workforce to business climate. 
It is worth a careful look. Not a defensive one. A serious one.
We cannot pretend the metrics in this report are accidental. They are the predictable result of policies, systems and cultural attitudes — embodied by Act 250 — that make it extraordinarily difficult to build housing, grow businesses and invest at scale.
But businesses are not the bad guys. They are employers, taxpayers, innovators and community sponsors. Without them, there is no tax base to fund the services we value so deeply.
As a state, we have to acknowledge that we are falling behind in ways that directly affect how people live, work and raise families. As this report illustrates, we now live in a state where a growing number of people cannot afford to live.
That sentence deserves to be sat with. Because when people cannot afford to live, the consequences ripple outward, quietly at first, then all at once.
It means schools where children arrive hungry, distracted by worry. It means families without stable housing, sleeping in cars, motels, or doubling up in unsafe conditions. It means teachers, nurses and first responders commuting long distances, or leaving altogether, because they cannot find a home near their work.
Creating another food shelf to feed hungry children is an act of compassion, but it is not a solution. It treats the symptom, but does not address the root cause, which is an economy that no longer works for too many Vermonters.
When people cannot afford to live here, they do not move here. When they do not move here, school enrollment declines. When enrollment declines, schools are forced to consolidate or close. Communities lose not just classrooms, but gathering places, identity and hope.
The same pattern is playing out in health care. Hospitals struggle to recruit staff who cannot find housing. Birthing centers close.  
You have all been reading the same headlines, so please, ask yourself honestly: Is this the state you are proud to live in?
Recognize that when you chase a development out of your neighborhood, you are not just protecting a scenic view. You may be preventing someone from living a dignified life. You may be ensuring that some teacher, chef or nurse cannot live in the community they serve. 
Take a good, long look at the competitiveness dashboard and ask how it affects your sector. Schools. Hospitals. Restaurants. Stores. Construction firms. Arts organizations. Sports teams. Municipal governments. None of them exists in isolation. When the system is under strain, everyone feels it.
We should also ask hard questions about the structure of our civic life. What does it mean to be a viable society when we have 6,400 nonprofits serving a state of roughly 650,000 people? 
Nonprofits are born of generosity and need, but they often emerge to fill gaps left by systemic failure. At some point, we must ask whether fragmentation is helping us move forward or simply helping us cope.
This is not a call to abandon Vermont’s values. It is a call to align them with reality. 
Imagine a Vermont that is still beautiful and agrarian. A place where neighbors help neighbors. A place that offers some of the best education in the world, strong health care, and vibrant local economies. 
Picture thriving downtowns and communities where people can afford to stay, and choose to come. A place where we find balance in how we work, how we play, and how we pursue joy and purpose.
That Vermont is still possible, but it will require compromise. It will require us to loosen our grip on a past that no longer exists and commit to a future that works for everyone, not just those already here. 
Believe in the possibility of abundance and support a future that allows that dream to exist for future generations.

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-15 23:45:01+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Tears, Trump and student transfers: House barely passes school-choice bill. Will it survive?",Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/15/school-choice-house-passes-mississippi-trump/,"Rep. Rob Roberson, left, answers questions from Rep. John G. Faulkner about House Bill 2 on Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026, at the State Capitol in Jackson.","The Mississippi House narrowly passed a major public-education overhaul Thursday after four hours of debate that centered on school choice — but also invoked President Trump, rifles and shotguns, the Psalm of David, pimps and meth addicts and even sexual innuendo.
The bill, authored by Republican Speaker Jason White, passed 61-59. Seventeen Republicans broke with White and voted no, and two Republicans did not vote.
The razor-thin margin is likely not the homerun that White wanted to see in his chamber, after his months-long campaign to expand school choice in Mississippi. The slim passage puts the bill’s future in doubt, with the Republican Senate leadership vowing to kill it, or at least the parts that would spend tax dollars on private schooling.
School choice refers to a collection of policies that give parents more power over their children’s education. But opponents argue that in doing so, public money is siphoned away from the public education system into private schools or the highest-performing public schools.  
White has been at the center of efforts to broaden school choice policies in Mississippi, one of the few states in the Southeast without an expansive program. The drive has, in large part, come from national conservative groups and the Trump administration.
Rep. Jeffrey Harness, Democrat from Fayette, acknowledged that pressure during the floor debate. 
“I know y’all have to do everything that Donald Trump tells you to do,” he said. “I mean, if he tells you to jump off a cliff, you’re gonna jump off a cliff.”
The crux of the divide in the House is ideological, representatives made clear on Thursday.

Democrats, led in dissent by House party leader Robert Johnson III from Natchez, said they believe the state’s public-education system should be rewarded for its recent success and that school choice would harm public schools, which must accept all students. In contrast, House Republicans said that parents, not the government, deserve the ultimate say over where and how their children are educated. Republican Rep. Celeste Hurst of Sandhill, in an unconventional opening, introduced the bill — estimated to cost the state $162 million overall and headlined by an education savings account program that would send public dollars to families to pay for private school tuition — by acknowledging its 446-page length.
“The opponents have called it gargantuan,” she said. “I have even heard the word ‘girth’ tossed around. And I get it, it’s really hard to embrace something that you can’t quite get your arms around … what’s also big is the issue we’re trying to address.” Others during the hourslong debate snickered as they used girth and similar innuendo.
And before the debate unfolded in earnest, Republican Rep. Jansen Owen of Poplarville, one of the authors and White’s right-hand man in the school choice push, was brought to tears.
“Supporting school choice doesn’t mean turning backs on public education. It means opening our eyes to the reality that every baby is unique and every baby is different,” he said, before turning away from the podium to gather himself.
There were recurrent themes throughout the floor discussion, including accountability, transparency and fears over resegregation. One major portion of the bill changes current law to remove the veto power of a home school district if a student wants to transfer out. The other school district, however, retains its power to accept or deny a student.
Johnson argued that idea was antithetical to public schools by definition. 
“If I live in a county, I can go to school in that county,” he said. “And if I show up at that school ugly, dirty, rambunctious, crazy, I don’t care what it is — they have to take you. That’s what public education is.”
House Education Chairman Rob Roberson, who represents Starkville, brushed off concerns that the public-school transfer provision would result in a concentration of high-performing students at the most well-resourced schools, causing rural, struggling schools with lower-income tax bases to lose students and, subsequently, close. 
Some Democrats likened it to the segregation of schools in the 1950s. 
“These schools that you’re talking about are going to close anyway,” Roberson refuted. “That’s the road they’re on.”
Lawmakers also took issue with private schools accepting state money, while adhering to their own standards, not public school standards. 
Rep. Bob Evans, a Democrat from Monticello, said there were no penalties in the bill, but Owen disagreed: If schools fail to educate students, their parents can send them elsewhere, he said. 
“Let me ask you a question: If little Johnny’s momma is on crystal meth, and little Johnny’s daddy is a pimp, can you tell me how they (are) gonna be able to choose that little Johnny is getting the right kind of education services when that’s not even on their plate?” Rep. John Hines, a Democrat from Greenville, asked. 
“I hope little Johnny has a good grandmomma,” Owen responded.

A handful of amendments offered by Johnson and Rep. Omeria Scott, a Democrat from Laurel, failed on the floor Thursday, including one presented by the latter to require a specific Psalm for provision of the bill that permits school boards to create policies that allow prayer at the beginning of the school day. 
While the House debated the lengthy House bill, Senate Education Chairman Dennis DeBar, a Republican from Leakesville, told Mississippi Today the Senate Republican majority does not support the House bill. Senate leaders have already passed a public-school transfer bill, filed legislation that mirrors portions of the House bill and made clear they don’t plan to entertain an education savings account program to spend tax dollars on private schools.
He also alluded to moves by House Republican leaders to finagle votes in a Wednesday committee meeting, such as asking some members to skip the meeting instead of voting no.
“The Senate position is what we passed and I’m going to support the Senate position,” DeBar said. “I’ve got votes on a single bill, I’m not twisting arms or asking people to walk. I’ve got the full support of the Senate. When the House bill gets here, if it gets here, we’ll deal with it in due course.”
But White on Thursday after adjournment denied any heavy arm twisting of House Republicans. He told reporters that he asked his members to vote ‘yes’ on the bill, and that pressure has come from their constituents and “politics,” not House leadership.  
And if the Senate kills his bill, White said senators will “answer to the voters” and suggested that Gov. Tate Reeves would call a special session to reconsider school choice expansion. 
“ I’m hopeful and optimistic that we can find some common ground,” he said. “The same people that voted for these representatives, voted for those senators, and I just can’t believe we’re that far apart.”
DeBar said he plans to call a committee meeting next week to handle noncontroversial bills. He plans to have his committee consider whatever version of House Bill 2 passes the House, but did not say when that would be. 
“My preference is to bring the bill up as is and not have amendments made to it because I think the committee needs to consider the bill in its totality and make a decision on how they want to move forward with it,” he said.

House Democrats outlined their plans moving forward at a press conference on the Capitol’s second floor steps immediately after adjournment.
“We hope the position of the Senate remains steadfast on this issue, and we’ll continue to talk to them and encourage them, along with everyone else in the House and Senate,” Johnson said. 
The bill was held on a motion to reconsider, a procedural motion that could bring more debate or another vote on the bill before it could move to the Senate.

Food assistance leaders are pushing hard this legislative session to expand aid programs and fill gaps left by federal cuts — but the response from lawmakers continues to be cautious.
Becka Warren, who manages the Vermont Food Security Coalition, told the House Committee on Agriculture, Food Resiliency, and Forestry on Thursday afternoon that investment will be critical this year for the state to continue making progress against hunger.
The coalition is a joint effort of the state’s largest food-focused organizations: Vermont Foodbank, Hunger Free Vermont, the Intervale Center and others. The group’s recommendations, formalized in the Vermont Food Security Roadmap 2035, range from increases in public funding for direct food assistance programs to stabilizing the state’s farm economy.
Before the committee, Warren outlined the coalition’s strategy to maximize federal funding for nutrition aid programs wherever possible, particularly given federal cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Part of that effort includes requesting a new appropriation of $6.3 million to cover additional administrative costs shifted to Vermont in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act last summer, she said.
Warren also requested a $5.75 million grant for local support staff she termed “benefit assisters” to help SNAP and Medicaid recipients navigate the programs’ changes. Such an appropriation would ease transitions for vulnerable Vermonters and also help minimize errors in the benefit systems, Warren said, calling the proposal “a great bang for a buck.”
Rep. David Durfee, D-Shaftsbury, who chairs the committee, said in an interview after Warren’s testimony that while hunger is “an issue that’s become more and more critical,” he’s constantly reminded that there’s “not a lot of wiggle room” in this year’s budget.
Nonetheless, Durfee said he was “struck” by the idea of paying for support staff to guide benefit recipients and retain available funding. Sufficient funding to run the state’s SNAP program, he added, also “has to be” in the budget.
John Sayles, the CEO of Vermont Foodbank, emphasized the connection between food security and Vermont’s farms in an interview Thursday. His organization is requesting a total of $5 million next year to fund his organization’s farm-focused Vermonters Feeding Vermonters program, as well as shore up the Foodbank’s emergency preparedness. Sayles said farms are a key part of food resilience in the state.
“When crisis hits,” he said, “having local sources and a robust local ag community can really help us.”

Vermont Education Secretary Zoie Saunders on Thursday floated three map proposals to legislators during a joint meeting of the House and Senate education committees but stopped short of endorsing one specifically.
One proposal would utilize the 11 existing Vermont School Board Association regions to organize new consolidated school districts, while another would use existing regional high schools as an organizing principle for 13 new districts — similar to an idea discussed by the school redistricting task force in the fall.
A third proposal would combine elements of the two maps into a hybrid proposal that Saunders in her presentation said would provide greater balance between districts.
Saunders called the maps a “strong starting point” that lawmakers could “build upon” as they continue their work. She added that the proposals were “viable maps for consideration.”
Asked later by Sen. Seth Bongartz, D-Bennington, the Senate Education Committee chair, whether the hybrid proposal was their “best shot” at landing on a map, Saunders said she felt the proposal “most closely aligns with the criteria and expectations put forth in Act 73.”
That proposal would feature 13 districts, and would notably split Chittenden County — the state’s most populous county — into three separate school districts, each with more than 6,000 students.
The largest district in the proposal would combine school districts in Franklin and Grand Isle counties and would have 9,122 students, according to the proposal.
Lawmakers are working to find a starting point to move forward with the consolidation of the state’s 119 school districts, and the 52 governing units that oversee them as mandated under Act 73.

Vermont’s prisons are holding more people than in the recent past — so the state is going to have to pay up to keep providing them all health care. The Vermont Department of Corrections is asking for $4.5 million to pay its privately owned and for-profit health care contractor, Wellpath, according to Haley Sommer, a spokesperson for the department. 
Out of that cost, $1.2 million could go toward expanding treatment for inmates with substance use disorder, according to Aviva Tevah, who directs health for the Corrections Department. The other $3.3 million could be spread across expanding a slate of other services to simply accommodate more people, Tevah told the House Corrections and Institutions Committee Thursday. 
“We don’t want to change the level of service we’re providing. And so if the population is increasing — it’s a natural outcome that the total cost will increase as well,” Tevah said. 
The cost increase is also a provision of its contract with Wellpath, which allows the cost of services to change if the incarcerated population changes significantly. 
According to data from the department, the male incarcerated population was 16% higher in December 2025 than it was in the same month a year prior. The female incarcerated population was 27% higher in December 2025 than it was in the same month a year prior.

The two candidates vying to be the next leader of the Vermont National Guard both told lawmakers this week they would resign that post rather than carry out an unlawful order from their superiors in the state or federal government.
Vermont’s Legislature elects an adjutant general, which is the top military officer in the state, every two years. The current office-holder, Maj. Gen. Gregory Knight, is retiring after seven years, creating an open race.
Two current guard members are vying to succeed Knight: Deputy Adjutant General Henry “Hank” Harder, who’s a retired Air National Guard general, as well as Army National Guard Col. Roger “Brent” Zeigler. Gov. Phil Scott is the commander-in-chief of the Guard, while the adjutant general is responsible for managing the force’s 2,700 members and keeping state military records.
This year’s adjutant general election is notable because it comes as members of the Vermont Air National Guard have been deployed under controversial federal orders.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services made a massive Ctrl-Z on its suspension of nearly $2 billion in addiction and mental health program funding nationwide. On Wednesday,  the Vermont Agency of Human Services expected to lose $5.3 million in federal grants as part of this federal notice — including the loss of $1.8 million for a school-based mental health program, Project AWARE, and $2 million for a substance use prevention program called Partnerships for Success, confirmed Nicole Distasio, the agency’s director of federal policy who has navigated the impact of cuts from the Trump administration on the state.  
By Wednesday morning, though, the feds said never mind and confirmed to national media outlets that it would reinstate the grant funds. Distasio said the agency had received rescission notices and was “cautiously optimistic” that it would receive the remaining reversals of the cancellations from the federal government on Thursday. 
The federal back-and-forth is taxing on the state agency, Distasio said. She said her entire workday — from 8 a.m. through 10:05 p.m. — was consumed by this.

(Photo by Cordell Johnson/U.S. Geological Survey)Alaskans today are grappling with an unclear future that is balanced between the impacts of a warming climate and the strain of depleting fisheries. What is clear is that a new proposal from Washington, D.C. would only make matters worse, threatening our coasts, cultures and climate. The proposed 11th National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program is open for public comment until Jan. 23 and targets the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, as well as Cook Inlet for rampant oil and gas drilling. 
To expand current drilling off Alaska’s coast would wreak havoc on Alaskan waters, wildlife and environment. Opening areas that have been protected for years is an affront to the vulnerable natural resources and species found there.  
In the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, the stakes are very high. These waters are home to polar bears, bowhead whales, walrus, ringed and bearded seals, seabirds, Arctic cod, five species of salmon and some of the most productive marine ecosystems in the Arctic. Many of these animals depend on sea ice or quiet, intact habitat — both of which are destroyed when oil rigs arrive. In the Arctic, oil spills spread beneath the shifting sea ice where darkness, freezing temperatures and remote conditions make containment and cleanup extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible. A major spill, often hours or days from the nearest emergency responders and necessary equipment, would be catastrophic and permanent. 
For Alaska Native communities, these fish and marine mammals are not abstract environmental concerns — they represent food security, culture and identity. Seals, walrus, and bowhead and beluga whales are hunted for food and oil for entire communities, sustaining cultural traditions in regions where store-bought food is profoundly expensive or unavailable. Many coastal communities rely heavily on species that depend on a healthy marine environment, like salmon and whitefish, for subsistence. Offshore drilling disrupts migration routes, degrades habitat, and increases the risk of contamination of fish and marine mammals. For remote communities living along the coasts, who are seeing firsthand the impacts of rising sea levels and erosion due to a shifting climate, the added impacts from offshore drilling will further strain livelihoods and food security.  
When drilling platforms hit the water, the risks to wildlife are enormous and irreversible. Exploration and drilling can fragment habitat, displace wildlife and introduce chronic noise and light that disrupt migration, breeding and foraging. Spills and leaks — whether from wells, pipelines or transport — can contaminate soil, surface water and groundwater, with toxic hydrocarbons that persist for decades and bioaccumulate through food webs. Routine operations release air pollutants and greenhouse gases, contributing to respiratory health impacts and accelerating climate change, which in turn amplifies permafrost thaw, coastal erosion and extreme weather in northern regions. Roads and industrial infrastructure increase human access, elevating the risk of invasive species, illegal dumping and long-term landscape alteration. Even after production ends, abandoned wells and aging infrastructure can continue to leak, creating enduring environmental and financial liabilities for future generations. 
In addition to the threats of opening the Arctic, Cook Inlet is also home to one of the most endangered whale populations on earth: the Cook Inlet beluga. Fewer than 350 animals remain across the entire population due to declining salmon runs, increased vessel traffic, seismic surveys and industrial noise — all of which interfere with beluga feeding, communication, health and reproduction. These whales are already struggling to survive. If more activity is brought into their waters through expanded drilling, their risk of extinction becomes more of a certainty.  
To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, we must decrease our consumption of fossil fuels. Opening new offshore areas to drilling locks in decades of continued burning and warming, at the exact moment we need less. The Arctic is warming faster than anywhere else on earth. To intentionally fuel more of that warming while putting livelihoods, food security and communities at risk is unconscionable. The comment period is open until Jan. 23 so the public can weigh in on the future of our oceans, wildlife and communities. More information is available at defenders.org or regulations.gov.

(Photo by Meghan O'Brien/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — A day before lawmakers were set to debate a bill that would dash his exclusive authority to dole out awards from an employer-funded pool of economic development dollars, Gov. Larry Rhoden signed an executive order to place “guardrails” on his use of the funds.
When asked during a Thursday press conference if he’s pushing back against allegations that he and his predecessor improperly used the fund, Rhoden said that’s not the case.
“I think it’s just to put in writing and give the legislators a comfort level that this is what we’re looking at when we’re making these decisions on Future Fund projects,” Rhoden said.
Governor hits the road to award more state grants; opponents call it campaigning

The Future Fund was created in the 1980s to allow South Dakota governors to nimbly advance economic development projects without intervention from lawmakers or oversight from a state board or committee. The fund’s money comes from a fee employers pay when they submit payroll taxes to the state’s unemployment benefits program.
The fund falls under the umbrella of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development. That agency has a board that reviews and approves awards in most circumstances, but the board doesn’t sign off on Future Fund awards.
The fund has drawn controversy in recent years, largely for the manner of its use by Rhoden’s predecessor, former Gov. Kristi Noem. 
Noem, now the secretary for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, used Future Fund dollars to pay for a gun range lawmakers declined to help pay for, and to help pay for a rodeo at which she appeared and workforce development ads that featured her as the star. 
Rhoden has used the money a handful of times during the year he’s spent in office, funding industrial parks in Aberdeen and Watertown and supporting a biotechnology company in Brookings. 
His executive order preserves the governor as the sole decision maker on the use of dollars from the Future Fund. The board would remain tangential and have no authority to review or overturn a decision.

The order does, however, lay out procedures on how Future Fund beneficiaries get the money, and it requires transparency on the awards. 

Grants must come on a reimbursement basis, the order says, and the entity securing the grant must prove it’s paid its bills before accessing the money, but the economic development commissioner can waive that requirement. 
The economic development office ought to, “when feasible,” require that the beneficiaries invest matching dollars into funded projects.
Awardees must have conflict-of-interest policies in place.
Awards and award agreements must be posted on the OpenSD.gov website, and the economic development commissioner must sign the agreement.
The economic development office must report on its use of Future Fund dollars biannually to the legislature’s Joint Committee on Appropriations.

Rhoden told a group of reporters that the order’s dictates offer transparency on the process, and that they are essentially “a direct reflection of how we do business today.”
Legislative interest
The Appropriations Committee already gets reports on Future Fund spending. Some lawmakers had aimed to reduce the fund’s revenue in 2024, but ultimately opted to back a bill that created the reporting requirement.
A bill to repeal the Future Fund’s revenue source failed by four votes in the state House of Representative in 2025.
Noem’s uses of credit cards and an economic fund cause lawmakers to propose restrictions

The first bill filed in the Senate for 2026 would move the authority to spend Future Fund dollars from the governor to the economic development board, which has 13 members appointed by the governor. It would also require the economic development office to spell out the criteria for awards and set interest rates for loans.
The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, said she still hopes her bill is approved. It’s scheduled to receive its first hearing Friday morning in the Senate State Affairs Committee.
It’s important, Howard said, that guidelines for the expenditure of taxpayer dollars are set by the Legislature. Governors can rescind executive orders, and there’s no clear mechanism for enforcement if a governor were to ignore existing executive orders.
“Different governors will do different things,” Howard said. “Certain governors will spend this money on rodeos, and other governors may spend it the way it was originally intended.”
When asked if he’d support a bill if it contained the exact language of his executive order, Rhoden said Thursday that he hates to comment on hypotheticals, but that he couldn’t see a reason why he wouldn’t.
Howard said she would consider bringing such a bill if her own proposal fails.
“I do believe something needs to be in statute,” she said.
Even so, she said, the question on who has the authority to spend money from the fund is a point of contention for her. The economic development board ought to review awards, she said.
“I don’t believe one person should be the deciding factor in how those funds are spent,” Howard said. “So I want it to go before several people.”
At Rhoden’s Thursday press conference, Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen said the executive order, in leaving the decision-making authority with the governor, preserves what he sees as the Future Fund’s primary value.
“You need to have a tool that is flexible and they can act quickly,” Venhuizen said. “And I think a positive thing about the Future Fund is that there is one person who’s accountable, the governor.”
Broader debate on economic development
The Future Fund discussion dovetails with a larger discussion on the role of economic development that’s grown into a rift among Republicans.
Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, is one of three candidates running against Rhoden in this year’s Republican primary for governor. Hansen has repeatedly decried state funding for economic development projects as “corporate welfare,” and his running mate, Canton Republican Rep. Karla Lems, is the prime sponsor of Howard’s Future Fund bill in the House of Representatives.
Lawmaker wants longer ‘cooling-off period’ for those who parlay public work into private-sector jobs

A few hours after Rhoden’s press conference, the state Senate took up a resolution meant to encourage “honest economic development rooted in the republican principles of limited government, deregulation, and organic entrepreneurial growth.”
The resolution asked senators to agree that “the free market and the private sector, left alone, will best serve our economic interests.”
The resolution’s sponsor, Republican Sen. John Carley of Piedmont, told his fellow lawmakers that the businesses that wish to develop and thrive in South Dakota ought to be able to do so without the aid of taxpayer dollars.
Carley said offering taxpayer dollars to companies instead of pushing for lower taxes amounts to “corporatocracy.”
“Instead of choosing corporations, let’s choose the taxpayers,” he said.
The resolution failed on a 15-17 vote, with one senator absent. Carley signaled his intent to have the vote reconsidered.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EM8A4567-copy-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 18:57:36.949519

(Courtesy of the Arkansas National Guard)Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced Thursday she was extending the deployment of around 100 Arkansas National Guard personnel to the nation’s capital. 
The deployment of the 142nd Field Artillery Brigade to Washington was part of the National Guard presence there, and was first announced in November. The extension of the “routine rotational relief” mission is for 90 days.
President Donald Trump mobilized 800 troops in Washington in August, citing a “crime emergency.” He has since attempted to deploy National Guard and other military personnel to several cities, mostly ones with Democratic mayors, such as Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland, Oregon. 
In several cases, federal district judges have balked at those efforts, including in Chicago and D.C., while appeals courts have sometimes paused those rules. An appeals court paused one such ruling affecting Washington, citing its unique status as a federal district, which has allowed the ongoing presence of National Guard troops there.
The deployed Arkansas National Guard members are conducting security patrols and “law enforcement support in designated areas,” according to Sanders’ press release.

(Photo: Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)The head of North Carolina’s prison system sounded the alarm at a legislative committee meeting Thursday about dangerous conditions created by lack of staff, a problem exacerbated by the failure of state lawmakers to approve raises for correctional workers. 
“Our staffing situation is dire and it’s dangerous,” said Leslie Cooley Dismukes, secretary of the state Department of Adult Correction. “Dangerous to my staff, dangerous to the people in my custody, and dangerous to the people of North Carolina.”
The state doesn’t pay enough to attract enough correctional officers, she said. 
Starting pay for correctional officers in North Carolina is the second-lowest in the nation at $37,621 a year, Dismukes told the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Justice & Public Safety. The average starting salary in southern states is $45,594. Nationwide, the average starting salary is $52,142. 
“If we do not address these issues, something bad will happen,” she said. “It is not a question of ‘if,’ it’s a question of ‘when.”
Staff shortages were at the root of the deadly inmate escape attempt at Pasquotank Correctional Center in 2017 where four staff members were murdered. A federal report said understaffing at the prison was so bad that workers cut corners with safety procedures. 
All the prisons were better staffed in 2017 than they are today, Dismukes said after the meeting. 
“It just takes one bad thing to happen that detrimentally affects someone’s life, someone’s health,” she said. 
Officers have been assaulted, but fortunately, none have been killed recently, Dismukes said. 
“But it can happen,” she added. “It can particularly happen when you do not have enough people to maintain the order of the prison, and that’s where we’re operating right now. So, it is really dangerous.”
Gov. Josh Stein proposed 6.5% pay increases for correctional officers in the budget he proposed last year. The state Senate approved salary increases for correctional officers that would have brought the base starting pay to about $40,000 a year. 
The legislature did not pass a comprehensive budget, so state employees have not received raises. 
In addition to staffing problems, the department needs to replace fire safety systems at a number of prisons. 
Six prisons need significant upgrades or replacements and are on “active fire watch,” which means an employee must walk through the prison looking for smoke, Dismukes said. Another seven prisons have obsolete systems and may soon be put on fire watch. 
The prisons have been using money from lapsed salaries to pay bills. Even so, the agency ended up with $89 million in unpaid invoices at the end of the 2025 fiscal year last June.. 
Committee members appeared to welcome Dismukes’ candid assessment of the agency’s challenges. 
“Appreciate hearing all this,” said state Sen. Buck Newton (R-Wilson). “We look forward to working with our counterparts in the House to see if there’s some ways that we can really impact some of these issues that we’re having.”
Another agency told the committee that it’s running low on money and will soon have to scale back its GPS ankle-monitoring program for people charged with domestic violence. 
The Criminal Justice Information Network, or CJIN, says it needs more than $4 million to maintain current operations. 
Courts can order people accused of crimes to wear GPS tracking monitors as part of their pre-trial release terms. CJIN oversees a system where victims and defendants are alerted when they are close to one another. Victims are called when defendants are within 300 feet, said CJIN Executive Director LaVonda Fowler.
CJIN had 1,391 GPS trackers in the field as of last week. But without additional money, it will be able to operate only about 400 trackers through June 30, Fowler told the committee. 
Chief District Court Judge Galen Braddy of Pitt County vouched for the program. 
“I put it in every domestic violence case I’ve got,” he said. “This is great money because the money that’s being spent is money that’s saving lives.”
The agency wants a permanent place in the state budget. 
The General Assembly is not expected to return to work on a state spending plan for months. 
After her presentation, Fowler said CJIN would need to start cutting the monitors in use “pretty soon,” but as of now, she said, there is no plan for how to do it.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-15-at-3.12.49-PM-1024x492.png,,,2026-01-15 18:57:36.949519

Farm Show on Jan. 15, 2026 (Photo by Ian Karbal/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins sought to reassure farmers facing a litany of challenges during a visit to the Pennsylvania Farm Show on Thursday.
“The farm show is an important reminder that we can not make America great again without making agriculture great again,” Rollins said. “We will never forget that, and certainly President Trump has put that at the top of his list.”
In 2025, farmers across America faced a combination of issues, like the fallout from trade wars impacting exports, a severe bird flu outbreak, unpredictable weather and rising equipment and fertilizer costs.
Rollins said the Trump administration is implementing policies that will benefit farmers across the country, though it will take some time for their effects to be felt.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
They include raising crop reference prices, expanding farmer safety nets, cutting taxes and raising possible deductions — all provisions of President Donald Trump’s signature domestic spending bill that was signed last summer.
But as farmers wait to feel the positive impacts, Rollins said, her agency is supplementing the agriculture industry across the country with $12 billion in what she called, “bridge payments.” Farmers will begin to receive the federal funds in February.
“We’re opening up the markets, but we’re also providing the bridge payments to make sure farmers can get to what we believe will be the golden age for agriculture,” Rollins said.
One area of policy Rollins focused on was trade. She said trade deals with dozens of nations made by Trump will benefit farmers who export their crops.
“While we’re looking at exporting a lot more, under the prior administration exports really slowed down,” Rollins said. “We’ll have a significant number of announcements of new trade deals with additional countries for agriculture coming in the next few weeks to months.”
However, data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) paints a more complicated picture than its secretary laid out.
U.S. Agriculture exports reached record highs in 2022 under former President Joe Biden, according to USDA data. Total exports declined in 2023 and 2024, but remained higher than during the first Trump administration, However, exports are estimated to have gone up slightly in 2025 over the previous year.
For Pa.’s soybean farmers, trade wars are only the latest struggle.

The U.S. agricultural trade deficit, however, did decline sharply under the Biden administration, following a trend that began in 2019 while Trump was still in the White House. The deficit is estimated to have risen further in 2025.
That’s due in part to disruptions in global trade caused by the administration’s tariff regime, a strong dollar making American goods more expensive for foreign buyers, as well as a high levels of imports.
Rollins also praised Pennsylvania Rep. Glenn “GT” Thompson (R-15) for sponsoring a bill signed into law allowing whole milk in American schools. 
“It really builds on the dietary guidelines that we released the week before,” Rollins said. “My partner in all that is Secretary Bobby Kennedy over at HHS, flipping the food pyramid to put real food back at the center of everything Americans do regarding our food supply system.”
Thompson, chair of the House Committee on Agriculture, joined Rollins at the Farm Show. He said the change will be a boon for dairy farmers.
“Dairy is the backbone of Pennsylvania’s ag industry,” he said. “It’s really important for rural economies. Anybody that watched that, when they took whole milk and 2% milk flavor out of our schools, we soon lost dairy farmers, and we lost a generation of milk drinkers.”
Rollins and Thompson were joined by Pennsylvania Reps. Dan Meuser (R-09) and Scott Perry (R-10), USDA National Nutrition Advisor Ben Carson, and Pennsylvania Treasurer and Republican gubernatorial candidate Stacy Garrity.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_8881-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-15 18:57:36.949519

Laramide Resources, Inc. on Jan. 12, 2026, issued a public notice seeking comment on its plans to dig the uranium mine, which observers say is a major development in the company’s push for the first new uranium mine in New Mexico in decades. (Courtesy MMD)The company seeking to build a new uranium mine near Mount Taylor announced a significant milestone this week, completing an operations plan that one environmental lawyer said indicates the company is serious about extracting the first load of uranium from the state in decades. 
Laramide Resources, Inc. issued a notice Monday alerting the public it had submitted a complete Mining Operations and Reclamation Plan to the state regarding the Jara Mesa uranium mine project about 10 miles north of Grants. The state’s Mining and Minerals Division, which is reviewing the application, deemed the plan complete and is now beginning its technical review, according to state officials and the notice. 
The 74-page plan is the culmination of years of data collection and marks a new phase of the project, according to Eric Jantz, legal director for the New Mexico Environmental Law Center. What happens now could set the precedent for how the state handles new uranium mine applications under the current legal framework the state created in 1993, he said. 
Uranium transport through Navajo Nation sparks concerns in New Mexico

“This is a big deal in a number of senses,” Jantz told Source New Mexico on Thursday. “It’s going to be the first uranium mine in New Mexico — if it starts, and that’s a big if — in …probably 40 years. It would also be, irrespective of if it produces anything, the first new uranium mine license under the New Mexico Mining Act. So it could potentially set the tone for how state regulatory agencies deal with conventional mines going forward.”
According to the plan, the mine, once built, will produce 12 to 15 truckloads a day of uranium ore to be processed at an unspecified offsite mill. The operation could run in New Mexico for up to 20 years, the company says. 
A spokesperson for Laramide did not respond to Source’s request for comment Thursday. The company’s notice says that the plan is available for inspection at the MMD office in Santa Fe or on its website, and says the public must submit written comments or requests for a public hearing within 30 days of the notice, which is Feb. 10.  
Both the state and the federal government have to approve the mine through parallel permitting applications, though the federal government has signaled it intends to fast track approvals. Last year, federal officials added La Jara Mesa and other New Mexico uranium projects to a list of projects they hope to streamline permitting for.  
Long-stalled NM uranium mines now ‘priority projects’ at Cibola Forest, leader tells employees

Also, the Jara Mesa project is one of two long-pending uranium proposals that Cibola National Forest officials deemed “priority projects” early last year amid President Donald Trump’s push for domestic energy production. 
In an interview last May, MMD program manager DJ Ennis told Source that the state has a “robust permitting process” that Laramide would have to navigate even if the federal government quickly issues its stamp of approval. 
MMD officials, in a statement to Source on Thursday, confirmed that the division has deemed the plan “administratively complete,” which sets in motion a multi-agency review. Agencies involved include the New Mexico Environment Department, the State Engineer, the state Forestry Division and Historic Preservation Division.
The statement did not say how long such a review could take. Jantz estimated it could take a few months to a year or longer. 
The state and federal Forest Service will also consult tribal governments, according to MMD, as part of the technical review.
The proposed site is near Mount Taylor, which is one of four mountains sacred to the Navajo people and other local pueblos. Tribes and pueblos in the early 2000s successfully convinced the state to designate the mountain and outlying areas a “traditional cultural property,” an effort to protect it from mining.
The Jara Mesa mine’s proximity to Mount Taylor is one reason anti-nuclear opponents have forcefully pushed back against the mine for more than a decade. They also cite the legacy of the uranium mining industry in New Mexico, which has left decades of radioactive and cancer-causing waste in its wake. 
‘The beginning of justice’

 
Jantz, who said he was still reading the plan Thursday, said he is keenly interested to see how the company intends to handle the “cultural integrity of the mountain,” as well as how it plans to transport any uranium for processing.
Jantz said the state regulations and the site’s cultural significance could prove important barriers in the way of the project, but the market could be the biggest one. Whether uranium prices rise high enough to make a new mine profitable is another major factor, he said, and the company will still need to determine how much uranium is available at its selected site. 
“But it certainly signals that La Jara Mesa believes the market is going to support, at least the first phase of the project, which is confirming the resources,” he said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-15-at-3.24.37-PM-1024x620.png,,,2026-01-15 18:57:36.949519

A new audit report by the Legislative Audit Division said ongoing accounting issues at Montana Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen’s office are so problematic the financial statements for 2023 cannot be trusted, and those from 2024 can only be trusted with explanation.
At a meeting Thursday of the Legislative Audit Committee, state Sen. Tom McGillvray, R-Billings, characterized the report as the Secretary of State’s office “flunking,” a description that auditors confirmed, even though a representative from the office disputed that, calling it a model for other agencies.
Jacobsen did not appear before the committee, and Deputy Secretary of State Angela Nunn did not explain her absence.
At the heart of the failed report, state auditors found the Secretary of State used incorrect estimates of a software program to make the financial report look better to legislators, and then failed to document its rationale even though Nunn insisted the department was not trying to mislead the public.
The Secretary of State’s Office also misrepresented and mischaracterized accounting mistakes so persistently that it could not stand by the financial numbers for Fiscal Year 2023, one of the two years auditors were tasked with checking. Furthermore, when the auditors tried correcting the misstatements so entries would accurately reflect the accounting, the office rewrote them four times and said the final statement was still “misleading.”
 

  Want to know more? 

The Legislative Audit Division staff puts out a podcast that details some of its findings about the Montana Secretary of State’s Office.
It can be found by clicking here.



At that point, auditors said the state had no other choice but to close the books for the year, but it means that neither the public or lawmakers have an accurate, fact-supported picture of Jacobsen’s office for 2023. Auditors noted that while staff members had previously tried to shift blame to other departments and staff, it was Jacobsen and her management team that ultimately bore the responsibility of getting the information correct — an opinion shared by the lawmakers.
“During the audit, we found instances where office management did not maintain responsibility for outcomes when external parties were engaged,” the audit said. “We also found that weak controls and misapplied polices have undermined the accuracy and reliability of the office’s financial reporting.”
  A 20-year software program 

Though often technical in nature, the fiscal or financial audit of the Secretary of State’s Office yielded several problems, which Nunn said have already been fixed. One of those was the large purchase of the state’s new election software, ElectMT.
Jacobsen’s office reported that the software would last 20 years without needing any maintenance, upgrade or replacement. However, state policy instead directs agencies to select a default of a four-year lifespan to better reflect reality. By not adhering to policy, the Secretary of State’s Office spread the cost of the software out across 20 years, which gave the appearance that the office was actually in better financial condition.
Nunn didn’t dispute state agencies often face the irritation of lawmakers because such a large expenditure — in this case, nearly $4 million for the software — would only last four years and not longer, but instead offered that an IT expert on staff said the software program would last 20 years in his experience. Yet, auditors noted even that explanation was not backed up by any documented evidence.
“Management searched for evidence to support their position rather than going out and finding data and using that as the basis,” said auditor Steven Althoff, who was the lead staff member on the report for the Legislative Audit Division.
Auditors instead surveyed the state’s software systems to better understand the lifespan, finding that the longest any software had reached was 16.6 years, with the shortest at 3.8 years. The median lifespan was 7.5 years.
Auditors told lawmakers the result of the 20-year depreciation schedule will cause a ripple effect, making the Secretary of State’s Office books somewhat inaccurate for two decades.
“This could result in modification of opinions in future financial schedule audits,” the report said.
By not reporting the large expense more accurately, auditors explained the overall financial health of the department is difficult to ascertain, and the numbers in their own financial statements cannot be seen as reliable.
“Office management was unable to provide documentation to support policy interpretations or accounting treatment decisions,” the report to the Legislature said. “Without adequate documentation, the office may be unable to demonstrate accountability for its decisions. We view this as a material weakness in the office’s internal controls.”
  Try, try again, try again, try again 

Another problematic finding by auditors revealed that the Secretary of State’s Office was supposed to enter notes on its year-end statements that described its methods or differences.
In one case, officials from the Department of Administration noted “misstatements” in the journal entires and asked staff to correct them to reflect reality.
“When management first submitted draft note disclosures to auditors, many required elements were missing and corrections were presented in the aggregate,” the audit report said. “Management said it used professional judgment to decide what information was necessary for readers. However, they were unsuccessful in meeting the office’s responsibility to provide complete financial information.”
Instead, auditors characterized the office as writing statements that were not appropriate for financial statements and ones that seemed more fitting for press releases and public relations.
“The first draft of the notes was written with a focus on taxpayers rather than the office’s operations and financial schedules, as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles requires,” the report said. “This approach omitted critical context about how activities related to the office’s finances produced a tone more suited to public relations than to financial disclosure.”
Auditors told the lawmakers on Thursday the journal entries were sent back four times and even on the final time, there were misstatements, but auditors said they had little recourse other than to close the books, but noted those statements cannot be trusted.
“Material misstatements persisted in each subsequent drafts,” the report stated.
Auditors also criticized the lag between the journal entries because they were so late, diminishing their value to lawmakers and the public. Althoff said ultimately the errors led the auditors to the conclusion that there were so many misstatements it would make it impossible for the Legislature to read them and get an accurate picture.
“They were inadequate and when they were rewritten, they introduced new errors,” Althoff said.
That year, 2023, received an “adverse” auditor’s opinion; the 2024 financials received a “modified” opinion, which means readers can trust the numbers, but only with the limitations or notes highlighted by the audit staff.
  Another concern 

Although not likely as serious as other portions of the audit report, staff from the Legislative Audit Division also noted errors that were likely clerical — in one case, the result of a mistyped account — but which misstated expenses related to the SOS Enterprise software Jacobsen’s office uses for business registration and other management.
The issue was how the Secretary of State’s Office categorized software maintenance — the costs associated with keeping the software system current. Some costs had been attributed to development expenses not to software. Those classification errors ranged from $40,000 to $327,000.
Auditors also noted the errors occurred in Fiscal Years 2021 and 2022, but weren’t corrected until 2024.
Nunn pushed back that the report was not as severe as audit staff had made it.
“You say you don’t agree with me that you’re flunking, so what part do you disagree with?” McGillvray asked Nunn.
“I don’t believe we’re flunking,” Nunn responded, acknowledging there were problems with previous audits. “We did the best we could and characterized what an expert on our staff with expert knowledge told us. We didn’t agree with how that was characterized. They did not quite capture that in a way that reflects reality.”
However, Nunn failed to provide additional information beyond what had already been discussed.
“We agree that documentation was lacking,” Nunn said. “We will improve.”

Joseph Schwartz was granted parole by the Arkansas Post Prison Transfer Board, according to an email sent Thursday by a notification system that tells the public about an offender’s change in status. 
Schwartz had been ordered last month to prison to serve out his sentence on state Medicaid fraud and tax evasion charges.
Schwartz, of New York, was three months into a three-year federal sentence for tax fraud when Trump pardoned him in November. 
Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin filed a petition last month seeking that Schwartz serve out the rest of his state sentence.
“We will review the Post Prison Transfer Board’s decision and will continue to ensure that Joseph Schwartz meets all requirements of his plea agreements,” Jeff LeMaster, a spokesperson for Griffin’s office, said. 
An attorney for Schwartz did not immediately return a call Thursday afternoon. 
Schwartz pleaded guilty in 2024 in federal court for his role in a $38 million tax fraud scheme involving nursing homes he owned across the country.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Some state employees who want to go to work for companies doing business with the state will have to wait longer if a new bill becomes law.
Republican Sen. Tim Reed, of Brookings, filed a bill Thursday that would require former state officials or employees to wait for two years before going to work for any entity that was the “beneficiary” of a contract the officials or employees approved, awarded or administered, if the contract value was more than $1 million. Existing state law requires a one-year waiting period for all such officials or employees.
“It’s a better cooling-off period,” Reed said. “And we, as legislators, have to wait two years before we can be hired to lobby.”
Reed’s bill is a response to South Dakota Searchlight reporting about Steve Westra, who was the commissioner of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development during the administration of Republican former Gov. Kristi Noem. 
Westra left his state job in 2023 and took a job with CJ Schwan’s a year later. While Westra worked for state government, he signed the first pledge of state aid benefiting the company. That aid now totals $69 million of grants, loans and tax rebates for the company’s $550 million, 650-employee food production plant under construction in northern Sioux Falls.

Westra has not responded to Searchlight messages. CJ Schwan’s said in an email last year that Westra “is currently employed by CJ Schwan’s to advise on business development and government relations matters. He was hired after he left state government. At no time did anyone from the company discuss potential employment with Mr. Westra while he was involved with state government.”
Reed formerly served as CEO of the Brookings Economic Development Corp.
“I’ve been involved with economic development for quite a while, and after finding out about this, it made me ask, ‘Should we be doing something?’” Reed said.

The CJ Schwan’s project will be good for the economy, Reed said, but “the optics” of Westra’s transition were “absolutely terrible.” 
Reed’s bill would apply to officials who recommended approval of a contract or supervise someone who makes the recommendation, he said. He has not heard an official response from the governor’s office, but said he’s gathering bipartisan lawmaker support.
Reed’s bill is part of a broader discussion this legislative session about economic development in the state, including uses of the governor’s Future Fund, which is the source of about half of the state aid benefiting CJ Schwan’s. Much of the Future Fund aid was approved during the Noem administration.
The governor has exclusive control of the Future Fund, which state law requires to be used “for purposes related to research and economic development for the state.” Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, has introduced a bill to put some restrictions on the fund, including a requirement that the state Board of Economic Development consider applications for funding.
Meanwhile, Gov. Larry Rhoden responded Thursday with an executive order outlining his self-imposed priorities and guidelines for using the fund.
“I think it’s just to put in writing and give the legislators a comfort level that this is what we’re looking at when we’re making these decisions on Future Fund projects,” Rhoden said during a press conference.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/591A1190e-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-15 18:57:36.949519

“We hope it's a space for everybody and all the populations of people that we serve. We could do some really fun and creative adventure and learning there,” Vermont Adaptive’s executive director said.

Rochester will be home to the first multiuse, adaptive outdoor recreation center in Vermont, project partners Vermont Adaptive Ski and Sports and Vermont Land Trust announced Wednesday. 
“The way we’ll be developing it and utilizing it in Vermont will be the first-of-its-kind,” said Erin Fernandez, executive director of Vermont Adaptive.
The central recreation hub will host multiday programming for veterans and affordable housing for Vermont Adaptive interns, often studying therapeutic recreation occupational therapy or physical therapy, she said.

In creating the outdoor center, Fernandez said she wanted to ensure facilities focused on holistic health and wellness. She also plans to create a meditation garden, sauna, cold plunge, cabin-style camping yurts and outdoor camping sites. 
Executive Director Gus Seelig said the Vermont Housing & Conservation Board provided around $765,000 of funding to secure the purchase of the property in December. The project benefits the organization’s conservation goals and expands Vermont Adaptive’s ability to serve people with disabilities, veterans, students and Rochester’s rural community, Seelig said. 
“This is a parcel of land that, from a recreation and natural areas perspective, would have been worthy by itself,” he said. “And the programming just enhances the value of the land. It’s going to improve quality of life for a whole bunch of people that Vermont Adaptive serves.”
Under the award conditions, the land must have a forest management plan and be placed under a conservation easement, Seelig said. Any changes to the farmhouse on the property must be done in consultation with the Division for Historic Preservation, given the building’s eligibility for the historic register, he added. 
Most of the 125-acre property will remain open to the public for recreation on trails for hiking, mountain biking, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing, as the land already has trails in place that connect to the Ridgeline Outdoor Collective trails in Rochester and the larger, long-distance Veloment trail network, said Mead Binhammer, project director at the Vermont Land Trust.
Around 20 acres of the property is not under the conservation easement and will be used for Vermont Adaptive’s recreation opportunities and programming, Fernandez said. Northern Border Regional Commission has provided a $500,000 grant for repairs and to build out accessible facilities.
In partnership with the property owners Vermont Adaptive, the Vermont Land Trust will head projects to create a buffer for streams and wetlands on the property that flow to the White River watershed, Binhammer said. This will help mitigate the impacts of significant flooding events like what Rochester faced during Hurricane Irene, he said. 
The trust will also help review Vermont Adaptive’s forest management plan to ensure actions benefit forest health and ecological diversity, Binhammer said.
“We think conservation projects like this, that sort of protect the upland surrounding a community may help to buffer those flood pulses and keep forests forested,” Binhammer said. “I think this is such a beautiful property — both for conservation reasons and recreation reasons — and think it’ll have a lasting community benefit in Rochester.”
Rochester is a “special place” where the community supports recreation opportunities in all forms, Fernandez said. The location of Vermont Adaptive’s new hub also happens to be halfway between Vermont Adaptive’s existing programs at Killington resort and Sugarbush resort, she added.
The property adds to 1,500 acres that Vermont Land Trust has already conserved in the Rochester Valley, Binhammer said. The local community’s economy is “really focused on outdoor recreation, bicycle, hiking use, and that pairs really well with conservation,” he added.
As the project rolls out,Fernandez said she envisions building out an adaptive mountain biking skills park, a farm-to-table harvesting garden, environmental education programming and other ideas people offer. 
“I’ll get the infrastructure laid out, and then from there, it’s whatever people really want to build, so I’m hoping it brings value and a lot of excitement to the community,” Fernandez said. “We hope it’s a space for everybody and all the populations of people that we serve. We could do some really fun and creative adventure and learning there.”

In a recent rate case, the Public Service Commission hit pause on that tool.
As a result, the Montana Environmental Information Center, a conservation watchdog, estimates ratepayers could be out nearly $8 million in that case, to the benefit of the monopoly utility.
The case involved many components, and late last month, the Montana Public Service Commission released its final order, including the decision to suspend cost sharing.
Tuesday, the Public Service Commission voted to take up the cost-sharing tool as part of another docket. At the meeting, a PSC rate analyst said the total financial effects will depend on final decisions by commissioners.
A PSC spokesperson said the tool was designed to be an incentive for NorthWestern to keep supply costs low, but the Public Service Commission wants to be sure it isn’t creating an unfair financial burden for either customers or the utility.
“Seven years have passed since sharing was established, and the Commission wishes to review intent and result to determine whether the mechanism works as intended,” PSC spokesperson Jamey Petersen said in an email.
A NorthWestern Energy spokesperson said the monopoly utility already has incentives to keep costs low — “to minimize customer rates” — and the utility didn’t suggest the suspension, but it isn’t opposed to the pause.
Cost sharing, not sharing
The cost-sharing mechanism outlines how the utility and customers split some recurring and variable costs, such as fuel.
If NorthWestern underestimates its base costs, it can retroactively charge customers just 90% of the difference, and the other 10% benefits the customer; if it overestimates, the utility keeps 10% of the extra.
Montana Environmental Information Center said the tool is supposed to ensure projections are in line with actual costs.
According to MEIC’s analysis of the final order, NorthWestern estimated its annual variable expenses would decrease by $94.5 million. But the utility underestimated.
Instead, those expenses were roughly in line with previous years, and $87.8 million higher than the estimate, MEIC said.
That would mean a nearly $8 million hit to the utility with the sharing mechanism in place, MEIC said. However, the loss to the utility would come as a benefit to customers, including residential ones.
At the same time, the low estimate on the front end offered NorthWestern a different benefit, MEIC said; it made the rate increase for residential customers in its application look less severe.
In 2023, the monopoly utility and Public Service Commission drew criticism when regulators approved a settlement that translated into a 28% increase in electricity rates compared to the previous August.
When the utility’s estimate ended up being altogether inaccurate in this case, the Public Service Commission opened the door to change the rules, the MEIC said.
“So NorthWestern gets the public perception benefit of fudging that its original rate increase request was only 8% while the PSC bails it out for its extremely low-balled estimates,” the center said in its analysis of the PSC order.
Another look at cost sharing
The Public Service Commission didn’t provide a different estimate of the potential impact of the suspension of cost-sharing in the case, but it offered a different characterization of its decision.
“PSC disagrees there is any bailout whatsoever and considers their actions to be reasonable ratemaking,” Petersen said.
However, Petersen also said the tool isn’t meant to be punitive.
In the order explaining the reason for the suspension, the Public Service Commission also noted the costs as filed by NorthWestern understated actual costs and revenues.
As such, the PSC said the sharing mechanism would “likely induce severe under-recovery and significant sharing loss for NorthWestern.”
In the order, the PSC also said sharing offers a gaming incentive in general for both NorthWestern and intervenors.
It said NorthWestern keeps 10% of overcollections, so it has an incentive to estimate high, whereas intervenors “are encouraged to low-ball” estimates because customers pay only 90% of undercollections.
Although the PSC already issued its order in NorthWestern’s major rate case, changes to cost-sharing still could apply to interim rates from the July 2024 to June 2025 period depending on the decisions the Public Service Commission makes in the future.
At the meeting Tuesday, staff recommended further testimony on the sharing tool. In an earlier email, Petersen said she anticipates a decision on the tool will come several months down the road.
“Until then, the suspension will be in effect,” Petersen said.
NorthWestern said sharing not an incentive
In an email, NorthWestern spokesperson Jo Dee Black said the final order and suspension of the cost sharing recognize the tool isn’t an incentive.
For one thing, she said, the power purchases, fuel and market transactions that are part of that mechanism — the Power Costs and Credit Adjustment Mechanism, or PCCAM — are passed through to customers.
“NorthWestern Energy does not earn on these costs and is already incentivized to keep them as low as possible to minimize customer rates,” Black said.
Black said most of them are outside the control of the utility anyway, such as fuel costs, and arguments NorthWestern should absorb related losses “resulting from the difference in forecasts” mischaracterizes the purpose of the tool, which she said is to best track flow-through costs.
In this case, NorthWestern also argued it wouldn’t need to estimate those recurring costs at all “if not for sharing.”
“We look forward to working with the Montana PSC and intervenors on a revised PCCAM cost-tracking mechanism that is in the best interest of our Montana customers,” Black said.
In the rate case, the Montana Consumer Counsel, which advocates for customers, argued the cost sharing tool does provide a motivation for controlling costs on the part of the utility.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-15 22:56:21+00:00,CT Mirror,CT officials voice concerns about Trump health care plan,Jenna Carlesso and Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/15/ct-officials-voice-concerns-about-trump-health-care-plan/,Connecticut health officials and lawmakers on Thursday expressed concerns about the Trump administration’s new health care policy framework.,"Connecticut health officials and lawmakers on Thursday expressed concerns about the Trump administration’s new health care policy framework — especially a plan to fund consumers’ health savings accounts — but some praised the transparency measures and proposed regulation of insurance companies.
President Donald Trump announced outlines of a health care plan he wants Congress to take up as Republicans have faced increasing pressure to address rising health costs after lawmakers let subsidies expire.
The cornerstone is his proposal to send money directly to Americans for health savings accounts so they can handle insurance and health costs as they see fit. Democrats have rejected the idea as a paltry substitute for the tax credits that had helped lower monthly premiums for many people.
The plan also focuses on lowering drug prices and requiring insurers to be more upfront with the public about costs, revenues, rejected claims and wait times for care.
“Health Savings Account-based proposals do not meaningfully reform health care delivery and continue to rely on high-deductible health plans, which are a barrier to patient access, and not a solution to lower health care costs,” said Dr. Mariam Hakim-Zargar, president of the Connecticut State Medical Society.
But the organization supports provisions that boost transparency and place more scrutiny on insurers.
“The Connecticut State Medical Society welcomes reforms that rein in pharmacy benefit managers and require meaningful transparency and regulation of large health insurance companies, including how often care is denied, where premium dollars actually go, and the astronomical profits health insurers generate at the expense of patients,” Hakim-Zargar added.
Sen. Saud Anwar, a South Windsor Democrat who is co-chair of the Public Health Committee, said the plan is “like putting a Band-Aid on a bullet hole.”
“After the Trump administration went out of its way to harm American health care in 2025, this is a pitiful response — it treats high health care costs as a shell game and lacks many details as to how some of these ideas will even be implemented,” he said.
The White House did not offer details about how much money it envisioned being sent to consumers to shop for insurance, or whether the money would be available to all “Obamacare” enrollees or just those with lower-tier bronze and catastrophic plans.
The idea mirrors one floated among Republican senators last year. Democrats largely rejected it, saying the accounts would not be enough to cover costs for most consumers. Currently, such accounts are used disproportionately by the wealthiest Americans, who have more income to fund them and a bigger incentive to lower their tax rate.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked at her briefing Thursday whether the president could guarantee that, under his plan, people would be able to cover their health costs. She did not directly answer, but said, “If this plan is put in place, every single American who has health care in the United States will see lower costs as a result.”
Enhanced tax credits that helped reduce the cost of insurance for the vast majority of Affordable Care Act enrollees expired at the end of 2025 even though Democrats had forced a 43-day government shutdown over the issue.
Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, has been leading a bipartisan group of 12 senators trying to devise a compromise that would extend those subsidies for two years while adding new limits on who can receive them. That proposal would create the option, in the second year, of a health savings account that Trump and Republicans prefer.
The White House official denied that Trump was closing the door completely on those bipartisan negotiations and said the White House preferred to send money directly to consumers.
A spokesman for Gov. Ned Lamont said Trump and senators should prioritize the federal subsidies.
“If President Trump is serious about actually making health care affordable for countless Americans who desperately need it, he’ll urge the Senate to pass, without any further delay, the three-year clean extension of the ACA enhanced premium tax credits,” the spokesman, Rob Blanchard, said. “This measure already passed the House on a strong, bipartisan vote last week, and if everyone cares as much about affordability as they say, the Senate should finish the job and deliver affordable health care.”
Trump proposal sows confusion
Health care advocates and legislators said the plan sparked confusion and lacked detail.
“We all want lower health care and drug prices, along with increased transparency in the industry. This proposal is not so much a plan but an outline lacking critical details,” said Rep. Cristin McCarthy Vahey, D-Fairfield, co-chair of the Public Health Committee. “It’s not clear how it will result in expanded access, improved outcomes, and reduced inequities — priorities of ours here in Connecticut.”
“If the intent is to allow people to use the money to buy insurance from exchange plans, it seems extremely inefficient and disadvantageous from an administrative standpoint to ‘bypass government,’ set up new HSA accounts, fund them, and have consumers pay exchanges or other insurers, when the system that’s currently set up to provide tax credits is already in place and keeps costs lower for everyone who has health insurance,” said Kathleen Holt, the state health care advocate.
“This does not appear to be a plan or even reasonable framework for a plan.”
Trump has long been dogged by his lack of a comprehensive health care plan as he and Republicans have sought to unwind former President Barack Obama’s signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act. Trump was thwarted during his first term in trying to repeal and replace the law.
When he ran for president in 2024, Trump said he had only “concepts of a plan” to address health care. His new proposal, short on many specifics, appeared to be the concepts of a plan.
“To date, we have not seen a detailed health care plan that we can appropriately evaluate and provide any substantive comment on,” Dr. Manisha Juthani, Connecticut’s public health commissioner, said Thursday. “We welcome any proposal from the administration that addresses the soaring cost of health care and reduces the financial burden on individuals while ensuring that cost is no longer a barrier to the care people need.”
Ayesha Clarke, executive director of Health Equity Solutions, called the plan “a wolf in sheep’s clothing.”
“It is framed as affordability reforms but, in practice, will drive premiums higher, reduce access to care, and increase rates of uninsurance and uncompensated care,” she said Thursday. “Funding cost-sharing reductions and adding a layer to subsidy distribution would shift costs and more burden of navigating overly complicated insurance plans to individuals. Systemic racism has for too long excluded Black and brown communities from employer-sponsored coverage. Thus, this plan will deepen the harm of this population.”
It was not immediately clear if any lawmakers in Congress were working to introduce the Republican president’s plan. A White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly and described some details on condition of anonymity said the administration had been discussing the proposal with allies in Congress but was unable to name any lawmakers who were working to address it.
Trump’s plan comes months after the Republicans’ big tax and spending bill last year cut more than $1 trillion over a decade in federal health care and food assistance, largely by imposing work requirements on those receiving aid and shifting certain federal costs to the states.
Democrats have blasted those cuts as devastating for vulnerable people who rely on programs such as Medicaid for their health care. The GOP bill included an infusion of $50 billion over five years for rural health programs, an amount experts have said is inadequate to fill the gap in funding.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26013737139022-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 17:56:56.905596

Equinor reported Thursday that it plans to resume construction on Empire Wind, a 54-turbine project off Long Island, N.Y. that is designed to provide enough power for 500,000 New York homes. The project is about 60 percent complete and has put about 4,000 people to work while revitalizing the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal. 
While it secured relief in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, Equinor said the underlying lawsuit challenging the US Department of the Interior’s December 22, 2025 suspension order will continue to proceed. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Monday against the stop work order for Revolution Wind, the offshore wind farm slated to power homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut.
Vineyard Wind 1, the project that has already begun generating power while it remains under construction, had not filed a similar legal action seeking to restart construction until Thursday.
The company said it filed for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts challenging the US Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s December 22 suspension order.
“Vineyard Wind continues to work with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, and other relevant stakeholders and authorities in the Administration to understand the matters raised in the Order,” the company said in a statement. “However, Vineyard Wind believes the Order violates applicable law and, if not promptly enjoined, will lead to immediate and irreparable harm to the project, and to the communities who will benefit from this critical source of new power for the New England region.”
Concerns about radar interference and unspecified national security risks were behind last month’s order from the federal government freezing large-scale offshore wind projects under construction off the US coast. 
In a December letter to Vineyard Wind 1 officials, the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said that the Department of War in November provided “new classified information, including the rapid evolution of relevant adversary technologies and the resulting direct impacts to national security from offshore wind projects.” Those impacts, the notice said, “are heightened” by Vineyard Wind 1’s “sensitive location on the East Coast and the potential to cause serious, immediate, and irreparable harm to our great nation.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image0032-edited-4.webp?fit=642%2C482&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-15 17:56:56.905596

(Stock photo illustration by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — Charges for gun possession crimes pending when state law changed to allow permit-less carry two years ago will vanish after this week’s House vote.
The House voted unanimously Wednesday to override Gov. Henry McMaster’s veto of a bill dismissing charges for unlawful possession of a gun that were pending when the law changed. That was the last step needed for the bill to become law. The Senate agreed unanimously to do the same at the end of last year’s session.
The bill was meant to close a loophole in a 2024 law that allowed adults who could legally buy a handgun to carry it without a concealed weapon permit.
That law, which supporters titled the “S.C. Constitutional Carry/Second Amendment Preservation Act,” created a deadline of March 2029 for anyone convicted of unlawfully carrying a gun to apply for expungement. The law allows for the clearing of one charge per person.
That didn’t include pending charges.
It’s unfair to convict and sentence people for a crime that no longer exists, Sen. Deon Tedder, the bill’s primary sponsor, said previously. The Charleston Democrat voted against the law legalizing permit-less carry but said people shouldn’t be left in limbo.
The bill Tedder proposed will not automatically dismiss all gun charges. People charged with possession as part of a larger case, such as using a gun to commit another crime, are excluded from the blanket dismissals. That change came after opponents of the bill argued it might let violent offenders walk free.
Some prosecutors dropped charges on their own. But, as of the beginning of 2025, at least 200 people were still facing penalties for a crime that was no longer a crime, according to data from the Commission on Prosecution Coordination. The agency did not have updated numbers Thursday.
McMaster, a former state attorney general, generally opposes dismissing charges and regularly vetoes any bills that involve expungements. He would prefer to leave decisions about dismissing cases up to prosecutors, he wrote in a letter explaining his veto.
Those with charges pending still broke the law at the time, even if it has since changed, so if a prosecutor wants to continue with their case, they should have that chance, McMaster wrote.
“Some charges might warrant dismissal; other charges may warrant continued prosecution,” he wrote.
McMaster vetoed a similar bill in 2024 for the same reasons. Senators voted unanimously to override that veto as well, but the House didn’t take a vote. The bill died that year, which was the second of the two-year session, before Tedder reintroduced it in 2025.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/man-with-gun-1024x733.jpeg,,,2026-01-15 17:56:56.905596

Laura Kelly wasn’t alone in questioning a rule that confined singing in the Capitol rotunda to the lunch hour and stood in the way of people eager to perform “Lift Every Voice and Sing” in honor of the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
Topekan Beryl Ann New of the Kansas State Board of Education patiently explained to the crowd that a policy forbid singing under the dome outside the hours of noon to 1 p.m. And, she noted, the MLK program didn’t start until 1. That meant the poem written more than a century ago by American civil rights activist James Weldon Johnson that blossomed into a cherished song, frequently referred to as the “Black National Anthem,” would have to be spoken during the event.
“We are not allowed to sing it,” New said. “Many of you may be tempted to sing it, so please don’t sing it because we don’t want the marshals to come in an escort us out.”
That’s when the Democratic governor walked to the lectern, seized the microphone and declared: “I’m going to use my executive authority and … ”
Her voice was drowned out by applause, and the audience proceeded to roll through three stanzas of the song.

“Lift every voice and sing,
Till earth and heaven ring,
Ring with the harmonies of Liberty;
Let our rejoicing rise
High as the list’ning skies,
Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.
Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us,
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us;
Facing the rising sun of our new day begun,
Let us march on till victory is won.” 
 
Kelly, who is completing her second term as Kansas governor, said King famously said during his “I Have a Dream” speech on Aug. 28, 1963, in Washington, D.C., that he yearned for a time when the nation judged people by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin.
“As a pivotal leader in the American civil rights movement, he showed immense bravery and leadership in the face of adversity, presenting us a different pathway marked by decency and respect,” Kelly said. “His vision was bold. His message was clear. His work remains a guiding light for justice, for equality and for service to others.”
King was assassinated April 4, 1968. He was shot on the balcony of motel in Memphis, Tennessee. King’s final words were to musician Ben Branch, who was scheduled to perform that evening at an event. King requested “Take My Hand, Precious Lord,” and urged Branch to “play it real pretty.”
During the Kansas Capitol program, Kelly signed a proclamation honoring King’s life. She closed her remarks with an ominous warning about toxic politics.
“I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the dark times we are facing as a nation,” she said. “A time marked by hatred and divisiveness, where many leaders want to isolate and intimidate rather than unify and inspire. It’s difficult not to feel like Dr. King’s legacy is being erased.”
She said it was impossible to ignore the ways President Donald Trump worked to undermine national recognition of King. She said nonviolent collective action should be the response.
“This year,” Kelly said, “as we observe Martin Luther King Jr. Day, we find ourselves at a crossroads. While this is frightening and demoralizing, we are not powerless. You can choose to live in ways that promote unity and reject prejudice.”



“Stony the road we trod,
Bitter the chast’ning rod,
Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;
Yet with a steady beat,
Have not our weary feet
Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?
We have come over a way that with tears has been watered.
We have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered,
Out from the gloomy past,
Till now we stand at last
Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.” 
 


Carolyn Wims-Campbell, a classmate and friend of Linda Brown, who was the namesake of the landmark Brown vs. Topeka Board of Education desegregation case, sat in the second row of seats in the Capitol rotunda directly behind the governor. She said she wouldn’t miss an opportunity to show respect for King’s legacy.
“I am here to honor the memory of a man who put his life in jeopardy and finally lost his life,” she said. “I think about his children and that he had said that one day they would be able to play in the parks with other children. Here, in Topeka, we had City Park for us Black folks.”
Rep. Susan Ruiz, D-Shawnee, said she celebrated King as a champion of nonviolent change because she understood the struggle Black people and others faced in their quest for civil liberties. Her father was an immigrant from Mexico, and her family experienced attempts by white people to marginalize them. Once, she said, they were asked to leave a restaurant in New Mexico because they were mistaken for American Indians would couldn’t be served there.
“The present administration … is hell-bent on getting rid of anybody who isn’t white. We are in it together,” she said. “The other piece about it is that we have to encourage young people. We need their energy for this fight.”
Sen. Pat Pettey, D-Kansas City, said King was a compelling leader who helped stir a nation to address inequality. He remained a beacon of hope for Americans, she said, and a role model for people working to find their voice.
Actions by politicians to back away from formal celebration of King’s legacy were harmful, the senator said.
“To even think about doing away with honoring him, I think, is not just a travesty against Black people, but to all of us,” Pettey said.



“God of our weary years,
God of our silent tears,
Thou who hast brought us thus far on the way;
Thou who hast by Thy might,
Led us into the light,
Keep us forever in the path, we pray.
Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee,
Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee;
Shadowed beneath Thy hand,
May we forever stand,
True to our God,
True to our native land.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Kelly-King-day-resolution-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-15 17:56:56.905596

DOVER, Del. — A proposal that would require Delaware voters to present government-issued photo identification at the polls was blocked Wednesday in the House Elections & Government Affairs Committee, halting one of the most significant election-procedure reforms debated in recent years.
House Bill 112, sponsored by Rep. Bryan Shupe, R-Milford South, failed to advance after the committee’s Democratic majority declined to release it for a full House vote. The bill would have required voters to show a valid photo ID before receiving a ballot, while also expanding access to free identification cards.
“This bill was about protecting confidence in our elections while making sure every eligible voter has access to the identification they need,” Shupe said after the hearing. “Voting is one of the most important civic responsibilities we have, and showing an ID is already required in countless areas of everyday life.”
Under HB 112, voters would have been required to present one of four forms of government-issued photo identification: a Delaware driver’s license, a Delaware nondriver ID card, a U.S. passport, or a military ID. Voters without photo ID would still have been allowed to vote by signing an affidavit affirming their identity.
To address access concerns, the bill also proposed making the first Delaware nondriver ID card free, eliminating the current $40 fee. Replacement or renewal cards would cost $20, and the Division of Motor Vehicles would be required to offer ID services at countywide outreach events at least twice per year.
The bill’s stated purpose, according to its legislative synopsis, was “to protect the integrity of our elections” by ensuring that voters present photographic identification at polling places.
Committee Chair Rep. Stephanie Bolden, D-Wilmington East, said Democrats opposed the measure because they believe Delaware elections are already secure and that the bill could create unnecessary barriers.
“There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in Delaware that would justify adding another requirement at the polls,” Bolden said during the hearing. “Our concern is that this could discourage or burden voters who are already eligible and lawfully registered.”
Democrats on the committee argued that existing safeguards — including voter registration verification, poll books, and signature checks — already protect election integrity. They also raised concerns that older residents, low-income voters, and non-drivers could face added difficulties, even with expanded access to free IDs.
Supporters of the bill countered that photo ID requirements are already routine across state government and daily life, including at courthouses, schools, hospitals, banks, airports, and for firearm purchases, and that voting should meet a similar standard.
“This isn’t radical,” Shupe said. “It’s consistent with what Delawareans already do when they board a plane, cash a check, or enter a government building. The bill balanced access with accountability.”
The proposal did not advance during the same committee meeting in which lawmakers approved legislation addressing special-election primaries, underscoring the political divide over election-law changes in the General Assembly. Democrats hold majorities in both chambers and have historically opposed voter photo-ID requirements.
Because the bill was blocked in committee, it will not move to the House floor unless it is reconsidered or reintroduced in a future legislative session.
For now, Delaware remains one of a minority of states that do not require photo identification to vote in person which includes California, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Minnesota.














Absolutely. Below is an expanded, Delaware-specific list, with an emphasis on state government operations, written in a way that can be lifted directly into a sidebar, explainer box, or companion piece to your HB 112 coverage.

Lisa McClain (R-Bruce Twp.) at the Mackinac Policy Conference, May 30, 2024 | Anna Liz NicholsMichigan U.S. Rep. Lisa McClain is facing tough questions over a newly disclosed private investment her husband made in Elon Musk’s xAI company, right as the U.S. government planned to expand xAI for integration with military systems.
Financial disclosures filed Dec. 15, 2025, show Michael McClain purchased between $100,001 and $250,000 worth of private stock in xAI. The U.S. Department of Defense on Dec. 22, 2025, announced that it was going to integrate xAI’s Grok language model into the GenAI.mil system, which deals in unclassified information and real-time insights.
The trade was first reported by Sludge, a nonprofit news project that covers money and its influence in politics.

Sludge also reported that this week, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth planned to ramp up xAI and Grok’s integration with military components, now giving Musk’s AI project access to classified Pentagon networks, which will invariably speed up the military’s use of AI.
The STOCK Act prevents congresspeople, or their family members, from making trades using nonpublic information that they might be privy to through their elected offices, and all trades must be disclosed within 45 days, according to the tenets of the act.
Sludge noted that there was no immediate evidence of McClain, a Bruce Township Republican, having received nonpublic information regarding the decision.
That said, talk of xAI, OpenAI and Google’s AI systems being used by the military have been brewing since the summer of 2025.
McClain is a leader in the U.S. House of Representatives’ GOP caucus, and has tight ties with the administration of President Donald Trump.
The representative was asked about the trade, which is being framed as a potential conflict of interest, in a Wednesday evening appearance on News Nation, a burgeoning cable news network. The anchor had asked McClain for assurances that the trade was made without any inside information.

Responding to our report, Lisa McClain says it couldn’t be insider trading because if she had insider knowledge her husband would have bought way more xAI stock. pic.twitter.com/FxSpEmIsHn
— Sludge (@Sludge) January 14, 2026

McClain appeared to be caught off guard by the question, and laughed it off before saying that it was “100%” not made with any insider knowledge. She then justified it by saying that, if she had received insider knowledge, “we wouldn’t have bought $100,000 worth of shares, we would have bought a heck of a lot more.”
“I also want to stop you, because you don’t even have your facts straight on that,” McClain said on the network. “It wasn’t a publicly traded stock, it was about $470 million, of which was a private offering.”
The anchor noted that the conflict of interest here wouldn’t be any different if it had been a public offering or a private offering.
“Quite frankly, I think that’s a very fair question,” McClain said in response. “Especially with all of the insider trading that happens up here. … For one, the Pentagon doesn’t release that information. But I can 100% assure you that we didn’t have insider information.”
Levi Teitel, communications coordinator for Progress Michigan, said McClain violated the public’s trust.
“When our elected officials and their family members profit from corporations with lucrative government contracts, the public starts to lose trust,” Teitel said. “And this is exactly what has happened with Rep. McClain and her husband’s investment in a company that’s working with the Pentagon. Mind you, xAI is owned by Elon Musk, who has been abusing his relationship with Trump to access our personal information while obliterating federal government agencies.”
Teitel added that McClain still needed to answer additional questions to ensure the trade wasn’t made with insider information.
“Did your husband purchase this stock using insider information? Knowing that Musk’s companies are tied to foreign governments, are you concerned about national security risks even when you stand to financially benefit?,” Teiltel said in a statement. “And what do you have to say to the three-quarters of Americans who feel that this kind of behavior is a conflict of interest that needs to stop?”
Teitel also called on Congress to ban their ranks and family members from trading individual stocks.
“It’s no surprise that Rep. McClain hasn’t joined her colleagues in cosponsoring a bipartisan bill meant to prevent this kind of activity from happening,” Teitel said. “We deserve better from our elected officials, and we need leaders who will stand up to this kind of corruption.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-22-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-15 17:56:56.905596

Mississippi’s former welfare director testified Wednesday that a leadership program at the heart of a criminal case against former WWE wrestler Ted “Teddy” DiBiase Jr. was done in accord with a federal faith-based initiative during the first Trump presidency.

John Davis, the former Mississippi Department of Human Services director awaiting sentencing for his role in the brazen welfare heist, has repeated this refrain multiple times during the four days he’s held the witness stand so far in the DiBiase trial.
In fact, when answering how he first met the wrestler, Davis described attending a 2017 meeting at the Governor’s Mansion, where he said Gov. Phil Bryant discussed new faith-based initiatives on the federal level. Davis said DiBiase’s brother, Brett, was there, and told the governor how his dad’s Christian ministry called Heart of David could be involved. Their dad is famed professional wrestling heel Ted “The Million Dollar Man” DiBiase, who delivers his testimonial about overcoming temptations during his time with the World Wrestling Federation by recommitting to Jesus.
Davis’ explanation provides some context for his communication with the DiBiase brothers, which was laden with references to God and scripture. “You are God sent,” Teddy DiBiase said in 2017 in one of his earliest messages to the welfare director. 
Davis frequently told the brothers, “I love you” and “God loves you,” though on Wednesday, Davis testified that he messaged many people in that manner, including the two nonprofit directors that funneled grants to the wrestlers.
The DiBiase family secured a total of nearly $6 million in federal grants through Davis’ agency, the majority coming from the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. Teddy DiBiase is facing 13 criminal counts including conspiracy, wire fraud, theft of federal funds and money laundering. Brett DiBiase pleaded guilty to charges in connection with the scheme; the father was not charged criminally; and all three DiBiase men are facing a civil lawsuit brought by the welfare department to recoup the funds.

TANF funds are meant to alleviate or prevent poverty through a number of possible ways – direct cash assistance to help families care for children in the home; the promotion of job preparation, work and marriage; reducing out-of-wedlock pregnancies; and the formation or maintenance of two-parent families. Auditors questioned tens of millions of dollars worth of purchases under this program from 2016 to 2020. 
When prosecutors asked Davis last week about why his agency transferred TANF money to Heart of David, Davis said it was part of the faith-based initiative that “the governor wanted us to do.”
The scope of services in one of Heart of David’s subgrant agreements included several items geared toward young people, including trying to “increase the number of adolescents who live a life of servanthood” and “strengthen attitudes and expectations towards community, family and their US citizenship.” The second agreement was more pared down, with Heart of David agreeing to “establish a network of partnerships, services and resources throughout Mississippi communities for faith-based and self activities,” according to a forensic audit.
In the first report detailing the misspending, the State Auditor’s 2019 MDHS Management Letter, the authors explain that TANF rules allow states to direct funds to faith-based organizations as subgrants, but they must include restrictions on explicitly religious activities. Auditors found that grant agreements between DHS and Heart of Davis did not feature such restrictions.
In October 2017, about four months after DiBiase began working on his first welfare-funded contract to create a leadership development program, he received an invitation to visit the White House from Jay Strack, a motivational speaker and then-member of President Donald Trump’s evangelical advisory board. The letter, shown to the court Wednesday, referred to DiBiase as “one of the best and brightest the nation has to offer.”
In 2018, Trump signed an executive order establishing the White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative, which stated that the administration wanted faith-based organizations to compete on an equal playing field with others for federal funding.
The same year, Trump signed the Family First Prevention Services Act, which Mississippi leaders vowed publicly to adopt and set up committees to carry out. The Act aimed to prevent family separations by allowing states to use child welfare funds on items that a family may need to keep a child safely at home. DiBiase sat on the state advisory council for the state’s Family First Initiative. Churches and faith-based organizations were part of the approach to coordinate prevention efforts across sectors. But the state didn’t submit its plan under the Act to the federal government until years after the scandal led to the effective dismantling of the initiative. 
As part of DiBiase’s work with the welfare department, the agency recorded him delivering what were supposed to be weekly inspirational messages to DHS staff – the people who work on the ground level to administer federally-funded assistance to needy Mississippians. He called the mini-lectures “Tuesday Turnaround.”
“We’re going to enhance our culture. We’re going to create a community and a family that is about growing, that is about loving, because if we can love ourselves and love each other, then we can love our clients at a greater level,” DiBiase said in one of the videos.
DiBiase went on to tell the story of Shamgar, an Israeli farmer who slaughtered 600 Philistines using an ox goad – “a stick with a nail on it,” DiBiase explained – and delivered Israel.
“Now this is in a book I read; I can’t talk about it. You know, I ain’t preaching,” he said in the video. “So what’s the lesson there? Just a simple farmer, right? Who picked up a stick with a nail on it and he delivered a nation. How awesome is that? Here’s the lesson. Start now. Ok? Use what you got. Do what you can. We know that we have issues in our offices, maybe the printers aren’t working, maybe somebody’s got a negative attitude. But that doesn’t mean you have to have a negative attitude, does it? You could respond in love. The printer doesn’t work, I’m sorry. Guess what? There – somebody – don’t let that affect you.”
Wednesday was a short day of trial, with U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves announcing after lunchtime that he had matters to handle in other cases. He paused the proceedings until Friday, when the defense is expected to continue its cross examination of Davis.
The criminal trial of DiBiase may be the only one to occur within the larger Mississippi welfare scandal. 
At one point while Davis was speaking on the witness stand this week, seven blocks away, Attorney General Lynn Fitch and various volunteers were bundling suitcases, part of a partnership with Focus on the Family. The evangelical Christian parachurch had donated 1,350 satchels for some of Mississippi’s roughly 4,000 foster children. 
The organization’s concept is that when children are neglected – the most common reason being poverty – or abused, and are taken from their families by state child protection officers, they often don’t possess any belongings, or if they do, they use garbage bags to carry the items. 
Laurie Todd-Smith, a former Bryant adviser, came to Jackson to promote the program. She now serves as deputy assistant secretary for early childhood development in Trump’s Administration for Children and Families, the agency that oversees TANF funding nationally. 
Each suitcase they planned to pass out to foster children contained a teddy bear and a Bible.
“I think Mississippi, of all the states I visited and all the states we’re working with, we are particularly a very faith-filled state,” Todd-Smith said during a Tuesday interview with Supertalk, a Mississippi radio network that received $600,000 in welfare funding during the scandal. “And I just feel so proud that we’re visiting a church today that the churches are engaging in this issue.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/15151246/DiBiase-MDHS-video.jpg,,,2026-01-15 17:56:56.905596

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa lawmakers gave initial approval to multiple bills Thursday relating to the responsibilities and requirements of public universities and the board that governs them, including presidential searches and academic course requirements.
Members of the Iowa House Higher Education Committee held their first subcommittee of the session on House Study Bill 538. It would require the Iowa Board of Regents to form a presidential search committee whenever a new university president must be selected. Previously, Iowa law stated the committee was optional.
The bill states that only regents can serve on such a committee, and the group “must recommend the most well-qualified candidates considered by the committee to the board, which shall only elect a president from the recommended candidates.”
The presidential search committee can contract with people “engaged in the business of placing highly qualified job candidates in leadership positions,” the bill stated, and any candidates considered by the committee “shall not be subject to public disclosure unless the identity of the candidate is made public pursuant to the terms of a written agreement.”

Rep. Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, filed the legislation and chaired the subcommittee, joined by Rep. Heather Matson, D-Ankeny, and Rep. Jeff Shipley, R-Fairfield.
“I’m going to save most of my comments for committee, but we will be looking at the presidential selection process again this year, obviously, and this is just a start,” Collins said.
The only public comment was positive toward the legislation, with Foundation for Government Accountability lobbyist Andy Conlin saying he is supportive of “anything that improves transparency, intellectual freedom and efficiency,” as well as actions to increase university’s abilities to “turn out a productive workforce.”
Shipley said “it seems” that faculty senates at some universities “have taken actions that have kind of degraded the reputation and prestige of their related institutions,” and he supports the bill, but declined to expand on his comments when asked by Matson.
The representative from Ankeny said she was “surprised” more people didn’t come to the meeting to comment on the legislation — the necessity of which she questioned.
“Pushing out the faculty senate and other critical partners diminishes the power and value of partnerships and civic engagement in our universities,” Matson said, “and I’m worried that this level of micromanagement will continue to sow distrust and make it harder to recruit qualified applicants.”
Collins said the open process of selecting a new university president comes with the problems of applicants working at other colleges having to go back “with their tail between their legs” after publicly trying to find a different job.
“I think it needs to be a closed process with the candidates on board with what the process is,” Collins said.
General education requirements under review in new bill
Titled the “Increasing Civic Proficiency in Higher Education Act,” House Study Bill 543 would require Iowa’s public universities to add introductory courses in American history and American government to their general education requirements, with each course valued at three credit hours at least.
“A course required by this section shall not be exclusively or primarily devoted to the study of subgroups of Americans or other nationalities,” the bill stated.
These courses would fulfill social sciences or humanities general education requirements, the bill stated, and the requirements won’t apply to students in degree programs that last three years or less. The Center for Intellectual Freedom at the University of Iowa, Center for Cyclone Civics at Iowa State University and Center for Civic Education at the University of Northern Iowa would “designate courses” fitting the requirements.
Each center would need to develop ongoing lecture and debate series as well if the legislation is signed into law. The bill stated these series “must promote civil dialogue and debate on the issues most important to the American public.”
The bill would also require the board of regents to review all undergraduate core curricula and general education requirements and submit a report to the General Assembly by the end of the year, and ISU and UNI’s centers for civic education would be required to submit annual reports on their activities.
Collins also chaired the subcommittee on House Study Bill 543 and said the UI requires students to take a course under the umbrella of “understanding cultural perspectives” and at ISU students have a “U.S. cultures and communities” requirement.
Courses that fit these requirements include “Printmaking and the Politics of Protest,” “Music and Social Change,” “Introduction to the Politics of Race,” “The Science Behind Prejudice,” “The Economics of Discrimination” and “Identity, Diversity and the Media.”
“We are going to be prioritizing history and civics education in the state of Iowa again, and quite frankly, I’m embarrassed by the state of our current liberal arts,” Collins said. “We’re going to return our core curriculum to the true liberal arts education it is meant to be, and the fact that the General Assembly even has to address this is embarrassing.”
Iowa Board of Regents State Relations Officer Jason Chapman said during the subcommittee meeting the board is registered as neutral on the legislation, but one concern he expressed was about language in the bill relating to transfer credits. He said he was unsure whether that included high school students or students transferring from another college or university. Collins said the board was welcome to bring forward any clarifying language for the bill as it moves ahead.
Connie Ryan, Interfaith Alliance of Iowa executive director and lobbyist for the organization’s action fund, said the group is opposed to the legislation, calling it an “overreach” of the Legislature to determine what specific classes students should and shouldn’t take. Those decisions should be left up to educators, she said, especially as costs continue to rise.
“The cost of higher education is going up. We talk about that all the time, the cost to students, the cost to families, and you’re taking six credit hours and mandating those credit hours, rather than those credit hours being used for a student’s area of study,” Ryan said.
Matson, who also served on both subcommittees, agreed with Ryan that “it is definitely not the job of the Legislature to dictate curriculum,” and lawmakers who aren’t happy with decisions being made by universities can’t decide that the Legislature has a “different role to play.”
Costs of implementation and how students’ schedules and ability to decide what classes they want to take for themselves are also worries Matson said she has from a more practical perspective, especially for those students in degree programs with very specific requirements.
“I am the first person to say that I think more focus on civics and overall history is incredibly important,” Matson said. “Civic engagement is something that I am deeply passionate about, but we also have to look at what the practical implication is of the legislation we’re proposing. And to me, this is not practical.”
She also expressed concern that the Center for Intellectual Freedom at the UI will have the right to decide what courses will be available at the university for American history and government.
Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, said during the subcommittee meeting he supports the legislation and he believes “the experts” who have traditionally been making these decisions haven’t been doing a good job.
“I don’t like seeing a younger generation that doesn’t understand our history, doesn’t appreciate our founding values, and in many cases are embracing socialism, which I think is totally incompatible with our constitutional principles,” Holt said.
The subcommittee recommended passage for both bills, and the Iowa House Higher Education Committee will consider the legislation.

Jan. 14, 2026. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. Cuts to programs like SNAP, funding uncertainty for schools and the threat of immigration enforcement actions were among the most pressing issues that superintendents from around the state presented to Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel at a roundtable hosted at an East Lansing elementary school Wednesday night. 
“It’s not sustainable,” said Judy Walton, superintendent of Harrison Community Schools. 
And while the individual issues all had their own impacts on schools —  teachers being asked to prepare for ICE entering the school or support staff like nurses being fired, for example — Nessel pointed to the broader trend of Trump administration policies working against public education.

“I think that the goal is to destabilize the public schools,” she said.
Katy Xenakis-Makarski, superintendent of Johannesburg-Lewiston Area Schools, has noticed shrinking Title funds — a term referring to the different Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) funding programs for low-income students and other groups — as well as changes to SNAP that impacted free breakfast and lunch program.
“It’s going to be this trickle down effect that I think is going to take years for us to see how this all ends up playing out,” she said. 
“When our kids aren’t sure what they’re going to have for dinner at night, it impacts us in school,” Walton added. “So while people don’t think of that as directly impacting schools, it certainly does.”

Announcements of Title funding had actually gone to a number of superintendents earlier in the day of the roundtable. Tom Livezey, superintendent of Oakridge Schools and the president of the Michigan Association of Superintendents & Administrators, said he had not yet opened the email with his district’s allocations.
“We’re all crossing our fingers to see what that number is going to be,” he said.
State Superintendent of Public Instruction Glenn Maleyko explained that, while he was not aware of any major cuts to Title funding at the moment — though there had been significant attempted cuts in July — he worried what might happen in the future to this funding. 
“My concern moving forward is that that federal funding could be in jeopardy,” Maleyko said after the roundtable.
Coby Fletcher, superintendent of Escanaba Area Public Schools in the Upper Peninsula described the impact of the delays and uncertainty for that federal funding, specifically in regard to a professional development program that he hoped to implement. 
“I’ve delayed that by a year, and I’m hopeful that I’m going to be able to continue that, and that the funds will even just keep coming,” Fletcher said. “To me, with the Department of Education, when you dismantle the mechanism, then you’re able to obfuscate the process. And so who knows what money is going to come when?”
In East Lansing, the only jurisdiction in Michigan officially deemed a “sanctuary city” by the U.S. Department of Justice, the fear of immigration agents has trickled down to a fear of even attending school for some people, Dori Leyko, superintendent of East Lansing Public Schools, said.
“Based on the makeup of our community and being by the university and being within a sanctuary city, I think there’s just increased fear within our families of what may happen, and we see that sometimes with fear of coming to school, because that’s where their kids can be found,”  Leyko said. “That’s one thing really uniquely we deal with here, and trying to figure out how to lessen that fear, because kids can’t learn if they’re scared.”
State Superintendent Dr. Glenn Maleyko emphasized that his priority is students during a roundtable event. Jan. 14, 2026. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance.
Anthony Berthiaume, superintendent of St. Johns Public Schools, agreed, noting that kids do not feel safe while in their schools. 
“When these kinds of things happen within the community, it makes it much more difficult for educators,” Maleyko said. 
“I would love to see members of Congress of all parties stand up and say it’s not proper to do ICE enforcement at the schools,” Nessel added following the roundtable. “You used to always have the sensitive places doctrine. We didn’t see ICE officers terrorizing children at their schools, but we are now, and it needs to stop.”
Maleyko also noted that he was encouraging state legislators to meet a July 1 deadline for a statewide education budget, emphasizing that with so much uncertainty around federal funding, knowing the state-level funding for each district is crucial. 
“What we’re looking for is teamwork and stability. We want teamwork from all levels. federal, state, county, township, district, school board, all those different levels, actually working together,” Livezey said. “We need to be able to predict what’s going to happen. Any successful organization is going to need to put a plan together to reach the mission of the district.” 
“We’re constantly hopping from fire to fire, because we live in a world where we develop systems and processes and procedures to ensure that everyone is taken care of and safe, but people have upended how we can do that,” Xenakis-Makarski said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC_3656-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 17:56:56.905596

Gov. Randy McNally announcing a package of bills targeted at immigrants on Thursday. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee Republicans on Thursday unveiled a slate of legislation targeting immigrants without legal status, crafted in cooperation with the White House, that could require public schools, vehicle registration centers, city governments and public health departments to verify, track and report immigration status. 
Few details about the package of bills — eight or nine will ultimately be filed, Republicans said — were released Thursday and lawmakers said they were awaiting White House and Department of Education guidance on legislative language implementing immigration checks in public schools. Lawmakers could not give an estimate of the bills’ costs to the state.
House Speaker Cameron Sexton said the legislation was written after months of close collaboration with White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, a key architect of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Tennessee Republican leaders said the legislation would serve as a “model for the rest of the nation.”
“The problem is you’ve seen over the country, whether you’re in Minnesota, you’ve seen fraud, abuse and waste by people here illegally,” Sexton said. “You also have seen crimes committed by people who are here illegally.”
“And so we’re going to lay out a path that’s transparent, that checks legal status, that protects taxpayers and also not allow locals to have weak compliance with state law,” he said. “We’re going to do what we can to make sure that if you’re here illegally, we will have the data, we’ll have the transparency, and we’re not spending taxpayer dollars on you unless you’re in jail.”










The problem is you've seen over the country, whether you're in Minnesota, you've seen fraud, abuse and waste by people here illegally. You also have seen crimes committed by people who are here illegally.


– Rep. Cameron Sexton, Tennessee Speaker of the House


Immigrant rights advocates were swift to push back on the Republican agenda, criticizing lawmakers for sowing division with legislation crafted at the direction of Miller, instead of focusing on kitchen table issues that impact all Tennesseans. 
“It’s obvious that Tennesseans are facing rising costs of groceries, of healthcare, of housing, and families across the state are struggling in this economy,” said Lisa Sherman Luna, executive director of TIRRC Votes, the political arm of the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition. 
“Yet, once again, the bills championed by our elected leaders and the supermajority do nothing to address the problems faced by everyday Tennesseans,” she said. Sherman Luna also cited the increased administration burden on state and local agencies across Tennessee performing immigration checks.
Immigrants in Tennessee, rather than being a drain on taxpayers, contribute $1.4 billion in combined state and local taxes in Tennessee, she noted.

Legislative Democrats accused Republicans of using undocumented immigration as an election-year tactic and distraction from high costs, saying they didn’t hear Tennesseans mention “illegal immigration” while canvassing the state last year.
“Immigration is part of the American story, and, as the daughter of an immigrant, it’s part of my American story, too,” Senate Democratic Caucus Leader Raumesh Akbari said in a statement. “Our immigration system is broken — but fear-based crackdowns and dangerous dragnet operations don’t fix anything. These policies separate families, endanger Americans and distract our leaders from the issues that matter most to Tennesseans.”
Republican leaders said the bills are needed for a litany of reasons, but mainly to stop crime committed by immigrants without legal status. In a press release, it said nearly 2,720 people not lawfully present in the country were charged or convicted of crimes in Tennessee from October through December 2024, according to the Tennessee District Attorneys General Conference.
The same report by the DAs conference says the immigrant population has a much lower rate than native-born Americans.
While President Donald Trump initially said his goal was to remove the “worst of the worst” from the country, lawmakers are focusing on anyone without legal documentation.
One bill creates a new state crime for immigrants who remain in Tennessee after receiving a federal deportation order, a measure that would likely face legal challenge. Only the federal government has the power to set and enforce immigration violations, which have been treated as civil violations.
State and local courts would be required to cooperate with ICE agents. Another measure would require all local law enforcement agencies to enter into so-called 287(g) agreements to work with ICE. More than 50 local law enforcement agencies have currently entered into the agreements, but some cities, including Nashville, have declined to participate.
Republicans also alluded to legislation designed to close “loopholes” in the state’s existing ban on sanctuary city policies, a measure widely seen to take aim at majority-Democrat Nashville. 
Tennessee lawmakers to take immigration cues from White House

The measure will require state and local governments, including public health clinics, to mandate referrals to ICE and Tennessee’s centralized immigration enforcement division when individuals’ lawful immigration status cannot be verified. The Tennessee Attorney General would be empowered to withhold shared sales tax revenue from “non-compliant municipalities.”
Another would require law enforcement conducting traffic stops to detain truckers and others with commercial drivers licenses who cannot verify their legal status, then immediately turn them over to federal immigration officials. 
Doctors, nurses, teachers and others seeking professional licenses would also be required to provide proof of lawful immigration status. 
And written driver’s license tests, now offered in scores of languages, would be offered only in English, with a one-year grace period that lawmakers said is intended to accommodate international companies operating in Tennessee. 
Another bill would mandate the use of an E-verify system for all new state and local government hiring. State law requires Tennessee’s private employers with 35 or more full-time workers to use the federal system to verify whether a person is eligible to work. Businesses with fewer employees can follow a different set of rules.
Republicans released few details about what might be the most controversial and impactful legislation: a bill requiring Tennessee schools to verify the immigration status of students. Details about how the information will be guarded or shared with federal immigration authorities are still being worked out, Sexton said.
“We’re doing the details right now,” Sexton said, noting he was awaiting guidance from the White House and the Department of Education. 
A bill last year by Sen. Bo Watson of Hixson and House Majority Leader William Lamberth of Portland to deny enrollment to K-12 students without legal status stalled amid questions of whether it would risk $1.1 billion in federal funding. The bill passed the Senate last year and could be brought back in the House this session.

Jim Pillen calls Nebraska ‘recession-proof’ in State of the State,Juan Salinas II,,,,,https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2026/01/15/gov-jim-pillen-calls-nebraska-recession-proof-in-state-of-the-state/,Pillen's election-year State of the State address highlights plans to slash state spending and try again for property tax relief.,"Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen before his State of the State address in the Capitol on Jan. 15, 2026. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Despite needing to fill a state budget hole, Gov. Jim Pillen spent much of his 40-minute speech painting a picture of Nebraska that has seen economic growth, calling the state “recession-proof.” 
He touted Nebraska’s diverse economy, built on agriculture and said the return of the Trump administration had “created countless new opportunities” for the state and its people.
“We can bet the farm that Nebraska is primed to grow,” Pillen told lawmakers Thursday. 
His State of the State address comes in a year when Pillen is seeking re-election with a massive war chest and many of the advantages of incumbency — and the possibility of a GOP primary race rematch with multistate agribusinessman Charles Herbster — or perhaps another Republican waiting in the wings. Former Democratic State Sen. Lynne Walz is also considering a bid.
Pillen’s speech emphasized his eagerness to work with Trump — pointing to his volunteering the state to be the first in the country to implement new federal work requirements for Medicaid recipients, beginning May 1 of this year. He also stressed that his administration’s staffers had initiated conversations with the federal government about the possibility of assisting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement by offering ICE the use of a now-former state prison in McCook as a new detention center for migrants. 
“Nebraska is proud to be doing our part to get the border secure and to protect America’s kids from criminals,” Pillen said. 
Pillen’s mentions of the economy looked past some headwinds Nebraska faced in 2025 that appear to be leveling off. Trump’s trade wars have had an economic impact, with Nebraska farmers bracing for another tough year, plagued by low corn and soybean prices. The Trump administration is trying to ease some of the disruption with $12 billion in ag-focused aid. Some state ag groups have said it’s not enough.

The governor also downplayed some of the blowback Nebraska lawmakers are likely to face while trying to close the state’s $471 million budget hole. As expected, Pillen laid out his plan to balance the state budget by cutting $495 million in state spending. 
Many of those cuts appear aimed at the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. His aim, he said, is to bolster a cash reserve or rainy day fund he said is the envy of many states.  He asked lawmakers for state investments into his agenda, including pushing for a $7 million appropriation of state funds for grants to Nebraska students looking to attend private or parochial schools. 
Nebraska voters have rejected similar voucher programs multiple times, with each proposal or tweak forcing the state teachers union and other public education supporters to gather signatures and raise money for petition drives. 
The broader issue crosses party lines: Some on the left support helping families living near struggling schools, while some on the right worry about what steering state funds away from public schools might mean for rural districts and students with special needs. Pillen, at one point in his speech, bragged about the state opting into the Trump administration’s new federal school choice tax credit program, calling the program “a game-changer.”

Once again, the governor, whose family runs a hog operation based in Columbus, said he hopes lawmakers will fund and pass property tax relief, this time seeking $170 million in help. He said such an effort will require looking at eliminating some sales tax exemptions that lawmakers have balked at before. He encouraged senators to “lead reform efforts” and pass a budget “that delivers lasting and transformative tax relief.”
Property tax relief has been a top priority for the governor since the 2022 GOP primary. He and the Legislature have taken both incremental and significant steps, including a billion-dollar investment in special education and foundation aid for K-12 schools. 
Last session, Pillen’s efforts to keep property taxes essentially flat lacked support from enough lawmakers. That was his third such property tax proposal in the past three years to propose broadening the sales tax base to lower property taxes. 
“I believe that tax cuts work,” Pillen said. “I believe they give Nebraska families and small businesses a boost. … Unfortunately, over the past four decades, much of what Nebraska has done is create carveouts, subsidies, loopholes and exemptions. What we thought was a tax cut was actually a tax shift.”
Pillen previewed what he hopes to accomplish with lawmakers in the officially nonpartisan Legislature during the short session. He asked senators to pass bills to eliminate “junk lawsuits,” add new business incentives, and remove “red tape” for large users of Nebraska’s public power infrastructure, including data centers that help power artificial intelligence. 
He tossed some red meat to the GOP supermajority, as he asked legislators to pass a bill from State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area, who again seeks to define school and state agency restrooms as “male” or “female,” based on 2025 definitions Kauth put into state law. 
The new bill, Legislative Bill 730, is identical to the half of Kauth’s 2025 law that she had to carve out last time to unify her Republican colleagues and pass the measure with the minimum support needed to overcome a filibuster.
“While we delivered important protections for locker rooms and similar spaces last year,” Pillen said during his address. “Silly politics left restrooms out of the bill.” 
Similar politics are still in play, as State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston still opposes that restriction, saying he doesn’t want to be part of the “Nebraska State Potty Patrol.” Pillen and Kauth would need 33 votes again to overcome a likely filibuster. 
On higher education, Pillen, who did not propose a cut this round to the University of Nebraska’s budget, proposed language that would outlaw diversity, equity and inclusion programs, as well as critical race theory. To his campus critics, Pillen said there are plenty of other places to attend college. 
“We are Nebraska, not a woke ivory tower on the coast,” Pillen said. 
Pillen, in a nod to President Donald Trump, who endorsed his reelection bid, asked lawmakers to try asking the state’s voters to alter how the state awards Electoral College votes for president rather than going through the Legislature. He said he supports a proposed constitutional amendment from State Sen. Myron Dorn of Adams that was pushed out of committee last session. 
Last year, the Legislature killed a bill that would made the same change legislatively. He will likely once again need 33 votes.
Pillen’s latest push for winner-take-all faces pushback from more than just Omaha-area Democrats, who have called the proposal an attempt to “suppress the voices of Nebraskans.” The change also has faced criticism from some rural Republicans who said they fear losing their “conservative voice” as Nebraska’s population becomes more urban and suburban. 
Much like presidents during State of the Union speeches, Pillen highlighted people his team invited. He highlighted six police officers from the Omaha Police Department, who faced gunfire from a suspect at an Omaha gas station, a convicted felon from El Salvador. He celebrated University of Nebraska-Lincoln student Mya Rourke, for “wanting a hard education, not political indoctrination.” And he applauded Grand Island teacher Michelle Thorne who he said wants to reverse a state law ​​that stops schools from suspending disruptive students in grades K-2.
Pillen seemed frustrated with one or more lawmakers for not standing up for Thorne — slamming his hand on the podium. He said, “Recognizing a teacher better be bipartisan … it’s hogwash if it’s not.” 
The governor said, “Although the challenges we face as a nation are great, in spite of a few Debbie Downers, the facts are crystal clear: This is an extraordinary moment for Nebraska.” 
As expected, organizations and groups across the state’s political spectrum offered different takes on the speech. 
Progressive anti-poverty advocacy group Nebraska Appleseed said the speech showed leaders “creating and celebrating barriers to progress.” Nebraska Democratic Party Chair Jane Kleeb said in a statement that “Jim Pillen will try to gaslight Nebraskans and paper over his failures.” 
The Greater Omaha Chamber praised new proposed business incentives, saying the idea “demonstrates a shared commitment to making Nebraska more competitive for investment.”

,DC,2026-01-15 21:55:58+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump rolls out framework on health care costs that’s silent on ACA tax credits,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-rolls-out-framework-health-care-costs-thats-silent-aca-tax-credits,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump outlined his health care proposals to Congress on Thursday, asking lawmakers to approve several broad policy changes “without delay” — but left out any mention of enhanced tax credits whose expiration has left some Americans with skyrocketing costs. Health care costs, especially the rising price of health insurance, have become a frequent talking point for politicians from both political parties following last year’s government shutdown, when Democrats repeatedly called on Republicans to extend the now-expired enhanced tax credits for Affordable Care Act marketplace plans. Trump reiterated in a five-minute video that he wants Congress to give Americans money directly so they can use it to offset the cost of health insurance or health care, a proposal that has so far been unable to get the traction needed to advance on Capitol Hill. Trump didn’t detail any income caps on the direct payments, which would likely be sent to Health Savings Accounts as opposed to a simple check. He also didn’t say how much per month or annually he wants lawmakers to provide Americans, leaving it for members of Congress to hash out. “The government is going to pay the money directly to you. It goes to you, and then you take the money and buy your own health care,” Trump said. “Nobody has ever heard of that before, and that's the way it is. The big insurance companies lose and the people of our country win.”The enhanced ACA marketplace tax credits, first implemented by Democrats during the coronavirus pandemic, expired at the end of 2025. The subsidies helped to keep premiums lower than they would have otherwise been for about 22 million Americans on those health insurance plans. The House voted earlier this month to keep the enhanced tax credits going for another three years, but the bill has stalled in the Senate as a bipartisan group of lawmakers tries to reach consensus on two more years of the subsidies with significant changes. Lower drug pricesTrump said in the video that Congress should approve legislation that requires prescription drug companies to ensure Americans pay the lowest price in the world for pharmaceuticals, a policy known as “most favored nation” that he has pursued during his second term. ""So instead of Americans paying the highest drug prices in the world, which we have for decades, we will now be paying the lowest cost paid by any other nation,” he said. “So any other nation that's paying the lowest cost, that's what we're going to pay. And the American people will get the savings.”Trump said the legislative request, which he dubbed “The Great Health Care Plan,” would require health insurance companies and health care providers to publicly share easy-to-understand information about what they charge and how much they make in profit.  “As the saying goes, sunlight is the best disinfectant. That is why my plan orders all insurance companies to publish rate and coverage comparisons in very plain English,” Trump said. “It requires insurers to publish detailed information about how much of your money they're going to be paying out in claims versus how much they're taking in in profits.” Health insurance companies, he said, would be required to detail how many claims they deny and whether those refusals to pay for health care were overturned on appeal. “And most importantly, it will require any hospital or insurer who accepts Medicare or Medicaid to prominently post all prices at their place of business so that you are never surprised and you can easily shop for a better deal or better care,” Trump said, though a 2019 rule created a similar requirement. “We will have maximum price transparency and costs will come down incredibly.”Path through CongressA one-page outline of the proposal posted to the White House website doesn’t detail whether Trump wants Congress to approve the policy requests through the complex budget reconciliation process that Republicans used to approve the “big, beautiful” law this summer or to negotiate a bipartisan bill with Democrats. A White House official, speaking on background on a call with reporters to detail the plan and the next steps, said the administration believes the “proposals all have broad support from the American people.”“We expect both Republicans and Democrats to be able to embrace them, so reconciliation would not be necessary,” the official said.The framework is intended to provide “broad direction” to lawmakers, leaving negotiators the ability to take any bill they may write in different directions, the official said, adding the administration is “open to working” with Congress on the details. “We want to make progress,” the official said. “We're not laying out a specific path.”The official said the president leaving out any mention of the expired enhanced tax credits for people who purchase their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act marketplace was not intended to cut off ongoing bipartisan talks in the Senate. “This does not specifically address those bipartisan congressional negotiations that are going on,” the official said. “It does say that we have a preference that money goes to people, as opposed to insurance companies.”Engaging drugmakersCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz said on the same call with reporters that the framework focused on “four pillars” the administration believes must be codified into law — solidifying most favored nation drug pricing, lowering health insurance costs, transparency from health insurance companies and more pricing information from health care providers. “Although we're taking major action at CMS, including fines and the like, having Congress say, ‘This is how it's going to be, this is a law of the land’ is important,” Oz said, adding that he really does believe there can be bipartisan support for at least some of the proposals. Oz said the administration’s approach to bring down the cost of prescription drugs to the lowest level offered anywhere in the world is not intended to impede innovation and reiterated that lawmaking is crucial for longer-term stability. “We believe by codifying it, we’ll make sure that the drug companies stay engaged for future administrations,” Oz said. “We also believe that by doing it correctly, we’ll not overreach and create challenges to life-saving drugs being continually evolved and developed in the United States.”The Trump administration, he said, wants Congress to give the Food and Drug Administration more leeway to convert prescription medications to over-the-counter availability, possibly increasing competition and decreasing prices. Oz said the price transparency portion of the request would help Americans to have more information about how long it takes to get routine appointments and whether health insurance companies are able to keep their rates down by frequently denying claims.",,,,2026-01-15 16:57:22.688440

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The former deputy director of Oklahoma’s mental health department settled with the Ethics Commission Thursday and will pay the state $2,500 for violating lobbyist registration and reporting law. 
Heath Hayes, 41, communicated with state officials “for the purpose of influencing governmental action” without being registered as a lobbyist, according to a statement from Lee Anne Bruce Boone, executive director of the Ethics Commission. 
Scott Adams, Hayes’ legal counsel, did not immediately return a request for comment. 
Bruce Boone would not disclose who Hayes was lobbying on behalf of. 
She signed the settlement Thursday following its approval by the Ethics Commission at its meeting. Hayes and Adams signed the settlement Tuesday. 
The Ethics Commission found Hayes had not violated Oklahoma conflict of interest rules, but had violated the lobbyist registration rules, according to the settlement. 
“Ethics Rule 5 exists to ensure transparency in the lobbying process and fairness for those who comply with the law,” Bruce Boone said in a statement. “When individuals engage in lobbying activity without registering, it places those who follow the rules at a disadvantage and undermines public confidence in government.”
Hayes must make his payment in the next 30 days and provide proof of payment to the Ethics Commission, according to the settlement. 
Hayes also faces ongoing criminal charges, separate from Thursday’s ethics settlement, after Oklahoma City police alleged he embezzled $17,500 from Healthy Minds Healthy Lives while serving as a board member of the nonprofit foundation, which was affiliated with the State Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services. 
Hayes is charged in Oklahoma County with one felony count of embezzlement in excess of $1,000, according to court records. The offense is punishable by up to up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $10,000 and restitution.

Brian Kemp gives two thumbs up at his final state of the state address in the Georgia Capitol Thursday. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp called for an expedited income tax rate cut and another tax rebate, new spending for law enforcement retirement savings and funding for a needs-based scholarship program in his annual state of the state address Thursday before the Georgia General Assembly. 
The speech — Kemp’s eighth and final address as governor — highlighted many of the policies that have shaped his legacy, including his efforts to raise wages for teachers and other state employees, issue tax rebates during years the state had a revenue surplus and shore up the state’s multibillion-dollar reserves. According to Kemp’s projections, Georgia’s state reserves and rainy day fund combined will have more than $10 billion by the time he leaves office. The state’s current reserves sit at $14.6 billion.
Traffic congestion, homelessness top Kemp’s agenda for his final year in office

“There’s no question the state of our state is stronger, more prosperous and safer today than it was in January of 2019,” he told lawmakers.
But Kemp’s speech also highlighted the rising costs of living across the state, and cautioned lawmakers against taking the state’s economic stability for granted.
“The reality is that too many of our citizens are still struggling to make ends meet and everyday costs are still too high,” he said. “Groceries, rent, insurance, clothes for the kids, it all adds up to more than it used to.”
In his speech, Kemp also previewed his priorities for his last legislative session as governor, which includes a proposal to accelerate a plan lowering the state income tax rate below 5%.
Kemp’s proposed tax cut would bring the state’s income tax rate to 4.99%, down from 5.19%. His proposal would take effect for this year’s tax year and cost the state about $750 million each year in future lost revenues. 
“This will fulfill a promise to the people of the state that I made during my re-election campaign to lower our state income tax rate to under 5% and with the General Assembly’s passage and my signature, it will come a full three years ahead of schedule,” he said.
But there is a push in the Senate to move aggressively toward eliminating Georgia’s income tax. A special Senate panel recently released a plan that would waive the tax on up to $50,000 a year for individuals and $100,000 for married couples starting in 2027 – and eliminate the income tax entirely by 2032. Republican House leaders say they are also readying a bill that would nix the property tax on primary residences. 
Victor Anderson. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Rep. Victor Anderson, a Cornelia Republican and chair of the House Governmental Affairs Committee, said that with Kemp’s proposed accelerated income tax cut, lawmakers could consider some sort of property tax relief reduction without impacting local government services.
“I also think there’s plenty of room for us to work with our local government on property taxes and still allow them to provide the services the citizens need,” Anderson said.
Notably absent from Kemp’s speech were discussions of hot-button social issues like banning diversity, equity and inclusion efforts or restricting access to gender-affirming care.
Instead, Kemp centered his speech on cost-of-living issues, including a proposal to distribute a one-time $2,000 bonus to state employees, and fund a needs-based scholarship for Georgia students that had previously been funded through private donations. 
The University System of Georgia Foundation’s DREAMS Scholarship would complement the state’s existing HOPE Scholarship, which is awarded to students based on merit. Under Kemp’s proposed budget, the DREAMS Scholarship would receive a one-time contribution of $325 million from the state to create more opportunities for Georgia residents to graduate without student debt.
“I believe we owe it to every child to ensure they start out on a level playing field, no matter their zip code,” Kemp said. 
House Minority Leader Carolyn Hugley. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
House Minority Leader Carolyn Hugley applauded Kemp’s push to fund the scholarship during his final year in office.
“We’ve been asking for a need-based scholarship for years,” she told reporters after the speech. “As you know, HOPE started out as a needs-based proposition, and they turned it into a merit-based scholarship. So I’m happy that on his way out the door, he’s giving a nod to something that we’ve been asking for for several years.”
But Hugley, a Columbus Democrat, also criticized Kemp’s proposal to send out one-time tax rebates to Georgia residents, saying it would not go far enough to address the state’s affordability issues.
This year’s rebates, which also require lawmakers’ approval, would be the fourth time Georgia taxpayers received an extra payment in recent years, and it would again show up as $250 for individuals, $375 for head of household and $500 for married couples filing jointly. All told, the rebates would cost the state’s rainy day funds about $1.2 billion.
The rebates “will not take care of the needs that most families are thinking about,” she said. “They’re thinking about child care. They’re thinking about paying rent. But a one-time $250, a one-time $500, what is that really going to do?”
Kemp also released his budget proposals Thursday. Here are some other notable details from his spending plans: 
Kemp’s budget would use $46.4 million to replace the recent reduction of federal funding for a key food aid program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The cuts were included in last year’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The governor’s plan would also add about $18 million to go toward reducing the state’s payment error rate to avoid future federal funding cuts to the program. 
Roughly $2 billion in Kemp’s proposed budget would go toward highway improvements around metro Atlanta, and another $250 million would be allocated to local road projects. Rural parts of the state would also receive $100 million to strengthen or replace failing bridges, and $35 million for natural gas infrastructure upgrades. He highlighted these infrastructure projects at Wednesday’s Eggs and Issues event. 
The proposal would also include $5 million to fund a full hand recount for this year’s election, and another $1.8 million to help scan and tabulate ballots based on the human-readable text.
The new spending will bring the size of this year’s budget up to $42.3 billion. Next year’s budget, which will take effect in July, is set at $38.5 billion. 
The governor sets the spending levels each year in his budget proposals, and while lawmakers can’t increase the money available, they can move money around in the budget to reflect their own priorities. Lawmakers are set to hold budget hearings next week.

(Photo courtesy of David Spang.)In South Carolina, the hemp industry is at a crossroads.
Without sensible regulation for the sale of hemp and hemp-derived products, we risk undercutting public safety, damaging industry credibility, and putting South Carolina small businesses in jeopardy.
Current South Carolina law does not regulate products containing hemp-derived cannabinoids, aside from limiting delta-9 THC to 0.3% on a dry weight basis under federal law.
This gap has allowed a rapid increase in products, from gummies to vapes, with little to no oversight or guidelines.
Fortunately, there is a solution.
For the last several years, the South Carolina Healthy Alternatives Association has worked to develop a reasonable and responsible regulatory framework for the state’s hemp industry. As the legislative session opens in Columbia, an amendment to House Bill 3924 provides an opportunity to implement that framework.
With the support of numerous legislators, we believe this amendment will make the proposal the only legislation that accomplishes the goals of our industry, law enforcement, and most importantly, protects the public.
States around the country, including Georgia, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Kentucky have passed bills to responsibly regulate hemp and hemp-derived products in their states.
Additionally, last month’s White House order on reclassifying marijuana also gave clear direction on full-spectrum hemp, signaling further support for consumable hemp products.
It’s time South Carolina joined its peers, ensuring access to these products for people who have come to rely on them, and protecting small business owners and the public from bad actors.
In December, local, state and federal law enforcement conducted “Operation Ganjaprenuer,” a series of coordinated operations against criminals trafficking illegal drugs across South Carolina.
Unfortunately, these actions also impacted legitimate businesses selling legal hemp products across the state.
For those businesses, Attorney General Alan Wilson called for exactly what is needed: a reasonably and responsibly regulated South Carolina hemp industry.
That means creating a framework for responsible regulations for hemp-derived consumable products to include the following:

Limiting sales to individuals 21 and over
Testing requirements to ensure safe and compliant products for consumers
Packaging and labeling requirements
Licenses for manufacturers, distributors/wholesalers, and retailers
Serving size restrictions

For responsible businesses trying to operate legitimately, the current patchwork of interpretations and inconsistent enforcement is unsustainable.
Business owners committed to doing things the right way are forced to compete with bad actors who cut corners, mislabel products, or target minors.
South Carolina can take an important step forward on regulating the hemp industry, protecting our families, and ensuring access to these products.
If we can amend H3294 with complete regulatory guidelines and send it to Gov. McMaster’s desk, we will ensure South Carolina catches up to the responsible regulations of our peer states.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CBD-hemp-business-commentary-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 16:57:22.688440
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-15 21:45:22+00:00,CT Mirror,PURA ordered to reconsider sale of Aquarion Water Company,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/15/aquarion-water-appeal-pura-ordered-to-reconsider/,The decision is a lifeline for Eversource's bid to sell Aquarion to South Central CT Regional Water Authority in a deal worth over $2 billion,"A Connecticut judge on Thursday said that the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority erred in its November decision to block the sale of the Aquarion Water Company and sent the deal back to regulators for further deliberations.
The decision, from New Britain Superior Court Judge Matthew Budzik, provided a lifeline for Eversource’s bid to sell Aquarion to the South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority, also known as the RWA, in a deal worth roughly $2.4 billion.
That deal would turn Aquarion — the state’s largest water utility — into a quasi-public authority operated in a similar manner to the RWA, with both entities sharing a board of directors and top staffers. But despite the purported benefits of public ownership, the deal attracted broad criticism from state officials and local leaders who argued that it would result in lost tax revenue, oversight from regulators and ultimately higher costs for consumers.
Budzik’s ruling remanded the case back to PURA, leaving open the possibility that its commissioners could still reject the sale along narrower grounds.
“Today’s clear decision from the court provides a path forward which we believe should be focused on collaboration and reaching a practical resolution that supports long-term infrastructure investment, protects customers, and ensures safe, reliable water service across Connecticut,” the RWA and Aquarion said in a joint statement. “We appreciate the Court’s direction and will continue engaging with PURA and all stakeholders as this matter moves forward.”
PURA was represented in the case by state Attorney General William Tong’s office. Tong, a Democrat, has been a staunch opponent of the proposed sale.
“We are reviewing the decision and evaluating next steps,” Tong said in a statement Thursday. “But this remand does not change the fundamental truth of this transaction — it’s a costly loser for Connecticut families and it shouldn’t happen.” 
PURA’s decision to block the sale rested entirely on regulators’ objections to the structure of the newly-created Aquarion Water Authority, which was established to manage the water company’s assets. In particular, the authority’s commissioners found the 11-member board created to separately oversee each utility was “unworkable” due the conflicting interests it would create among board members. The decision also cited concerns that Aquarion’s customers would lack an independent voice to advocate on their behalf, similar to the state’s Office of Consumer Council.
While the commissioners specifically said in their written order that both the RWA and the new authority had the financial and technical capabilities to operate a water utility, they ultimately determined that those managerial problems were too big to overcome.
Both Aquarion and the RWA sued to overturn that decision, arguing that PURA went outside the scope of its authority to reject the sale. 
Specifically, their attorneys argued that the governing structure of new Aquarion Water Authority was dictated by a state law passed during a special session of the legislature in 2024 to facilitate the sale of the private utility.
Attorneys representing PURA, the consumer counsel and several municipalities opposed to the sale argued that regulators are empowered to second guess lawmakers who wrote the law establishing the new water authority — and to determine whether the structure they came up with serves the public’s interest.
During a hearing in the case on Wednesday, however, Budzik appeared skeptical of that argument. “PURA works for the legislature, not the other way around,” he said.
Ultimately, Budzik said in his written decision Thursday that while PURA does not have the authority to overrule acts of the legislature, at least one of the concerns cited in the authority’s decision to block the sale does fall within regulators’ purview.
That issue had to do with the RWA’s Office of Consumer Affairs, which lawmakers tapped as the entity to advocate on behalf of Aquarion’s customers following the sale. Budzik said that while PURA could not deny the sale based solely on objections to that decision, the commissioners could object to the amount of funding or staff allocated to that office. Currently, the office is staffed by one part-time attorney to advocate on behalf of RWA’s 121,000 customers.
“How these permissible regulatory concerns might ultimately affect the approval or disapproval of the application given that the court has overturned other aspects of the decision is a matter for PURA to decide in its regulatory discretion,” Budzik wrote. 
Opponents of the sale reacted with some relief Thursday that Budzik’s decision did not order regulators to approve the transaction, as attorneys for the utilities had requested. 
“We appreciate that the Court refused to order PURA to approve the application, and instead remanded the case to PURA for further proceedings,” read a statement from First Selectperson Christine Vitale of Fairfield, one of the towns that was involved in the appeal. “We will continue to fight against this unacceptable transaction — which will guarantee unregulated increases in water rates — and we look forward to continuing to advance our arguments to PURA that this transaction is unacceptable to the town and clearly not in the public interest.”
Consumer Counsel Claire Coleman said in a statement that Budzik’s ruling will allow PURA to continue considering the public’s interest in its review of the Aquarion deal and future utility acquisitions.
“On remand the OCC will continue the approach we took in the original proceeding to protect the wallets of Aquarion customers and ensure that if a transaction is to move forward, it is not just for the benefit Eversource’s bottom line, but it is a good deal for customers,” Coleman said. 
While both PURA’s decision and the subsequent appeal focused largely on the governing structure of the new authority, critics of the sale have focused their arguments on the potential cost and impact to Aquarion’s customers. (As part of the deal, Aquarion plans to sell off its assets in New Hampshire and Massachusetts to the utility company Unitil.)
As part of the application submitted to PURA, officials at both Aquarion and RWA had pledged not to seek a rate increase for at least six months following the sale. After that initial period, officials projected that Aquarion would require annual rate increases of between 6.5% and 8.35% over the next decade in order to maintain its operations.
That would effectively double the cost of water for Aquarion’s customers, critics said.
But supporters of the deal, including Eversource, pointed out that utility’s last rate increase came in 2013, even as the costs for things such infrastructure maintenance and treatment of PFAS chemicals have risen substantially.
The last time Aquarion sought a rate increase, in 2023, PURA instead cut the company’s revenues by $2 million.
In December, Aquarion officials announced their intention to seek a 42% rate increase — worth roughly $88 million — if the sale of the company is not approved. That amount was higher that the $64 million estimate of needed revenues that company officials gave to PURA during its consideration of the proposed sale.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025_0306_SR_AquarionReservoir_047-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 16:57:22.688440

Currently, child welfare services are nested within the state Department of Health and Human Services. However, there have been multiple attempts to separate the entities. 
Sen.

He introduced a similar bill two years ago that was passed by the Maine Senate, but ultimately died. 
On Thursday, Republicans and Democrats on the Health and Human Services Committee underscored their desire to keep Maine children safe, but they overwhelmingly rejected Timberlake’s proposal because they said it isn’t the best way to achieve that goal. 
“Simply creating another department doesn’t fix the problem nor does it save a child, unfortunately,” said Sen. Marianne Moore (R-Washington). 
Rep. Michael Lemelin (R-Chelsea) has historically rejected the idea of creating a unique child welfare agency, but voted in support of the proposal to give Timberlake a chance to make changes to the bill.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)This commentary was originally published by The Conversation.
The Denver Broncos announced in early September 2025 their plan to build a privately financed football stadium. The proposal received a lot of attention and praise.
Across the five major sports leagues in the U.S. – the NBA, NHL, NFL, MLB and MLS – only 20% of facilities are privately owned.
I’ve studied the intersection of state and local public finance and pro sports for two decades. This experience has led me to approach claims of private financing with suspicion.
Private dollars are often masked as public dollars in these arrangements.



A Fox31 Denver news report aired in November 2025 about the Broncos’ plans for a new stadium.
Private vs public dollars
In theory, what counts as private or public dollars is uncontroversial. Dollars are public when government has a legal claim over them — otherwise, they are private.
The public versus private dollar distinction matters when accounting for who is contributing how much to a sports facility. When public dollars are allowed to count as private dollars, a project proposal looks more enticing than it is, in fact.
For instance, lawmakers regularly allow team owners to count public dollars as private dollars. The Sacramento City Council agreed to let the NBA’s Sacramento Kings count their property tax payments for the city-owned arena as private contributions to the overall cost of financing the arena. But property taxes are public dollars that in other instances go toward public services like schools and road repairs.
Team owners building private facilities also typically receive public dollars through tax breaks, which is government spending in disguise. Property tax exemptions, sales and use tax exemptions on materials and machinery, and income tax credits are common forms of government givebacks to sports team owners.
I’ve estimated that property tax exemptions alone, among facilities in the five major leagues, have cost state and local governments $20 billion cumulatively over the life of teams’ leases, 42% of which would have gone to K-12 education.
Rental payments spent on facilities are not private dollars
Many facilities and their infrastructure are funded through public debt secured in part by team rental payments. Lawmakers, media and consultants often view projects secured by rents as privately financed, in part or whole.
However, rental income in exchange for use or operation of public property should not be counted as private dollars.
Here’s a thought experiment. Suppose state lawmakers allocated the rent paid for use of campground sites in a state park to pay for new campground bathrooms. Are the bathrooms privately funded?
The flaw in concluding “yes” arises from a failure to appreciate that lawmakers, through policy, create legal claims over certain dollars. All dollars start as private dollars, but through the tax system, lawmakers transfer ownership of some dollars to the public.
It is the government landlord’s choice, a policy decision, to spend the rental income on the rented property, a choice available to them only if they own the rental income in the first place.
Yet lawmakers regularly allow teams, both professional and minor league, to count rental payments as private contributions. This accounting makes sports subsidies look less generous than they actually are.
Looking beyond construction
Facilities not only need to be constructed but also operated, maintained and eventually upgraded. Roads, sewer lines, overpasses, game-day security and emergency response and public policies to mitigate gentrification caused by a facility are all common taxpayer-funded touchpoints. In addition, facilities have preconstruction costs such as land acquisition, soil remediation and site preparation, as well as later costs such as demolition and remediation for the land’s next use.
Focusing on privately financed construction and ignoring all other aspects of a project’s development and operation is misleading, potentially contributing to lawmakers making inefficient and expensive policy decisions.
By way of example, the Council of the District of Columbia approved a subsidy agreement last year with the NFL’s Commanders. The stadium would be financed, constructed and operated by the team owner, who would pay $1 in rent per year and remit no property taxes. In exchange for financing the stadium privately, the owner receives exclusive development rights to 20 acres of land adjacent to the stadium for the next 90 years.
The stadium is expected to cost the owner $2.5 billion, with the city contributing $1.3 billion for infrastructure.
But the city also gives up market rental income between $6 billion and $25 billion, depending on future land appreciation rates, that it could make on the 20 acres.
In other words, the rent discount alone means the city gives up revenue equal to multiple stadiums in exchange for the Commanders providing one. It is as if the council has a Lamborghini, traded it straight up for a Honda Civic, and then praised themselves for their negotiation acumen that resulted in a “free” Civic.
The Broncos’ proposed stadium
As of January 2026, Denver taxpayers know only that the Broncos stadium construction will be privately financed and that public dollars will be spent on some infrastructure.
Being enamored with such a proposal is similar to being offered a $1 billion yacht at a 75% discount. In my experience, there are two types of public officials: one will want to spend $250 million to save $750 million, while the other will ask whether $250 million for a yacht is an appropriate use of taxpayer resources given existing needs elsewhere.
My hope is that lawmakers better appreciate the many ways government participation in sports facility development, including privately financed ones, imposes serious risks and costs for current and future taxpayers. What is the expected total cost of the stadium project over its life? How much of the life cost would public resources cover? Could public resources generate greater benefits in an alternative use? How much will it cost to mitigate or compensate those affected by a project’s expected negative side effects, such as gentrification, congestion, pollution and crime?

Buckson’s Term Limits proposal ensures lawmakers consider whether longevity in office strengthens governance or undermines it.
DOVER, Del. — A Republican state senator has introduced a proposed constitutional amendment that would impose term limits on Delaware lawmakers and several statewide elected officials, reopening a long-running debate over legislative longevity, accountability and voter choice.
Senate Bill 222, sponsored by Sen. Eric Buckson, R-Dover South, would cap the number of terms served by members of the General Assembly and limit tenure for key statewide offices, including attorney general and treasurer.
Under the proposal, state senators would be limited to five four-year terms, or 20 years, while state representatives would be limited to eight two-year terms, or 16 years. The bill would also impose a two-term limit on the attorney general, state treasurer, auditor of accounts and insurance commissioner.
Buckson said the amendment is intended to increase accountability, encourage leadership renewal and restore public trust in state government.
“Delaware voters deserve a system that allows leaders time to be effective, but not to become entrenched,” Buckson has said previously. “Term limits provide a clear end point and ensure regular opportunities for new ideas and perspectives.”
Because SB 222 would amend the Delaware Constitution, it faces a high procedural bar. The measure must pass both chambers of the General Assembly with a two-thirds majority in two consecutive legislative sessions before it could take effect. As a result, no current officeholders would be affected in the near term.
The bill has been assigned to the Senate Executive Committee.
Lawmakers Exceeding Proposed Limits
If the limits outlined in SB 222 were already in place, several current and former legislators would exceed the proposed thresholds based on their years of service.
State Senate (more than 20 years):


Sen. Dave Sokola, D-Newark, first elected in 1990, has served 36 years, making him the longest-serving legislator in Delaware history.


Sen. Gerald Hocker, R-Ocean View, has served a combined 24 years between the House and Senate.


State House of Representatives (more than 16 years):


Rep. Daniel Short, R-Seaford, first elected in 2006, has served 20 years.


Rep. William Carson, D-Smyrna, first elected in 2007, has served 19 years.


Rep. Stephanie Bolden, D-Wilmington, and Rep. Debra Heffernan, D-Bellefonte, each first elected in 2010, are at the proposed 16-year limit.


Former Rep. Robert Gilligan, who served more than 40 years in the House before retiring, would have exceeded the proposed limit by more than two decades.
Why Term Limits Appeal to Voters
Supporters argue term limits resonate with voters because they prevent legislative seats from becoming de facto lifetime positions, reduce the power of entrenched interests and ensure regular turnover.
Advocates also say term limits create space for new candidates, younger leaders and individuals with current professional experience to enter public service. Many voters, they argue, already assume term limits exist and view them as a commonsense reform.
Why Some Lawmakers Object
Opponents of term limits counter that voters already have the power to remove lawmakers through elections and that experience matters in a part-time legislature dealing with complex budgets, regulations and legal frameworks.
Critics also argue term limits can weaken institutional knowledge, shift influence to unelected lobbyists and staff, and limit voter choice by barring popular or effective lawmakers from seeking reelection.
Delaware voters have rejected term-limit proposals in the past, most notably in a 1994 constitutional referendum.
Still, Buckson’s proposal ensures the issue will again be part of the conversation in Dover — and among voters — as lawmakers consider whether longevity in office strengthens governance or undermines it.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/istockphoto-168250183-612x612-1.jpg,,,2026-01-15 16:57:22.688440

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Helping Rhode Islanders afford health insurance, home energy bills and child care is an expensive proposition: nearly $15 billion in fiscal 2027 under Gov. Dan McKee’s budget proposal.
The $14.9 billion tax-and-spend plan unveiled by McKee’s office Thursday marks the largest spending plan in state history — $522.6 million more than the current year’s budget although the dollar figure on fiscal 2026 is poised to cross the $15 billion dollar-mark under proposed revisions by the executive branch.
Embattled McKee highlights affordability, takes on Trump in 2026 State of State

The eye-popping button line comes amid stark federal funding cuts under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (H.R. 1 Reconciliation Bill) poised to decimate social safety net programs for vulnerable Rhode Islanders while increasing state costs. Indeed, the gap between state revenue and expenses is poised to swell to $537 million by fiscal 2031. Nearly one-third of the deficit stems directly from H.R. 1, according to analysis by the state Office of Management and Budget.
“It’s gotten worse, as you can tell,” Brian Daniels, budget office director, said in a press briefing with reporters Thursday. “That’s not particularly heartening.”
But the headline-grabbing bottom line belies what Joe Codega, state budget officer, insisted is a “disciplined process” with “modest” growth in state general revenue. Less than half — $6.0 billion — of the total fiscal 2027 spending would come from state coffers under McKee’s proposal. This represents an increase of 2.5% over the $5.8 billion included in the fiscal 2026 budget. Federal funding covers the bulk of the remaining spending plan, including $292 million in leftover pandemic aid that must be spent by the end of the calendar year. 
“The $15 billion headline, I realize, gets attention,” Codega said. “But it really is a broad universe of spending in that $15 billion total.”
Across the galaxy, here are 10 highlights to focus on:
1. Cleaning up the Big Beautiful Mess 
Many of the sweeping federal changes to eligibility and funding for social safety net programs don’t kick in for nearly a year, or more. 
But state administrators want to prepare. McKee’s proposal includes $19.3 million in state general revenues ($45 million across all funding sources) for information technology, full-time workers and contractors to implement the necessary changes to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). This includes working to reduce the 12.3% error rate in distribution of SNAP benefits to avoid up to $50 million in federal penalties down the line, and updates to the RIBridges electronic benefits portal to ensure compliance with new Medicaid work requirements.
More than 33,500 Rhode Islanders are expected to be kicked off Medicaid by the end of the calendar year because of new federal work requirements, while a separate group of 13,000 who buy insurance through the state marketplace are likely to opt out of coverage this year because they can’t afford the higher premiums. 
 McKee’s budget proposes $10 million to offset hospitals’ uncompensated costs from treating uninsured patients, and another $9.5 million to help 6,500 of the lowest-income self-insured afford insurance through the state marketplace — though not until January 2027, one year after the federal discounts expired.
The Rhode Island Community Food Bank will also see its annual state grant double, from $1 million to $2 million — as McKee highlighted in his State of the State address Tuesday.

2. Tax the rich, save the seniors 
Bad news for millionaires, cigarette and cigar smokers: Your taxes will go up under McKee’s spending plan. Despite reticence at a tax on top earners in past years, the executive branch has finally acquiesced to the progressive call for an extra 3% tax on income over $1 million. 
“H.R. 1 really forced our hand on this,” Daniels said. The income tax is expected to bring in $67.1 million in fiscal 2027, rising to $135 million in fiscal 2028, affecting 7,800 people, 2,300 of whom are Rhode Island residents.
Also boosting state coffers: a 75-cent increase per pack of cigarettes to $5.25; raising the cap on cigar taxes from 50 cents to $2; and removing the 1.25% discount for cigarette distributors that stamp their own packages for a collective $8 million in additional revenue. This is the third year in a row that McKee has moved to raise the cigarette tax, though lawmakers nixed the move last year.
On the other side of the ledger, seniors collecting Social Security, families with minor children and motorists will see savings under a series of tax credits and cuts. A three-year phaseout of the state’s income tax on Social Security benefits— mirroring policies adopted by 42 other states — will ease costs on 32,000 seniors while meeting the AARP Rhode Island’s top legislative focus for the year. The move cuts $40 million from state coffers, however.
A new, permanent child tax credit, $325 per child, replaces the dependent exemption on state income tax filings to help level the benefit across income levels. The change will help 31,200 people — just over one-quarter of state tax filers. 
For motorists, McKee wants to roll back the 2-cent gas tax increase that took effect in July, reducing the gas tax from 40 to 38 cents per gallon, made possible after paying off motor fuel bonds. And for tax scofflaws, the administration is offering the first amnesty program since 2017, hoping easing up on delinquent taxes will generate some revenue, rather than none at all.
3. Electricity bills vs. environmental mandates 
McKee’s solution to soothe frustrations over rising home energy bills comes at the expense of state environmental mandates. His eight-pronged approach to save ratepayers $1 billion over the next five years — or $180 a year for the average customer using 585 kilowatt-hours of electricity — hinges on rollbacks to state mandates for renewable energy, energy efficiency and utility infrastructure upgrades.
Most significantly, the 2022 law requiring the state to generate 100% of its electricity needs from renewable sources, or purchase credits to offset the fossil fuel sources, has now been extended to 2050, matching the overall decarbonization deadline of the Act on Climate law. This will cut bill costs for ratepayers by nearly $64 million in fiscal 2027. 
Large community net metering projects will also be charged a new fee to offset local taxes, project construction costs and interconnection upgrades, saving ratepayers $20 million collectively. And customer charges that fund energy efficiency projects will be capped — saving ratepayers another $21 million — with the reduced bill charges partially offset by $10 million in new state borrowing as part of a “green economy” bond. 
Acting Energy Commissioner Chris Kearns framed the decarbonization rollbacks as an attempt to balance climate goals with affordability concerns while recognizing the 180-degree shift in federal incentives for clean energy since President Donald Trump took office.
“Rhode Island ratepayers should not pay the price for President Trump’s chaos in Washington,” Kearns said during the briefing.
Despite advocates’ outrage at the executive profits and shareholder returns for Rhode Island Energy, McKee’s suite of changes only includes one direct cut to the utility supplier: eliminating an energy efficiency performance incentive for shareholders, which saves ratepayers $2.5 million a year.
Michael Dalo, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Energy, did not specifically respond to questions regarding the proposed cuts to company shareholders.
“We appreciate the Governor’s focus on energy affordability and look forward to reviewing the full details of his proposals and working with stakeholders to advance affordability measures as the legislative process unfolds,” Dalo said in an email Thursday.

4. Bonds. $600 million worth of bonds
McKee is proposing six bond initiatives totaling $600 million, a package representing the priciest ballot request in state history, even accounting for inflation, budget officials said.
That is 50% more than the $400 million bond package in 2020, which would be the inflation-adjusted equivalent of $515 million in November 2026. This year’s suggested bond bundle includes:

$215 million for higher education, with $105 million for an “Integrated Health Building” to support nursing, pharmacy, medicine and other interdisciplinary sciences at the University of Rhode Island; $50 million to renovate and add a student success center to the Adams Library at Rhode Island College; and $60 million for the Community College of Rhode Island to add a career and technical education center to its Warwick campus.
$120 million for housing development, divided into $25 million for home production and $95 million to preserve the state’s stock of affordable housing via redevelopment, construction, property acquisition, and improved infrastructure. 
$115 million for economic development, with $70 million for site development at the Quonset Business Park in North Kingstown as well as the I-195 Redevelopment District in Providence. The other $45 million would flow toward “growth industry” infrastructure meant to fortify the state’s ocean, defense, life science and data analytics sectors. 
$50 million for the green economy, spread out across initiatives like energy efficiency programs, shoreline resilience efforts, land conservation, watershed restoration, brownfield remediation, and local recreation efforts — a bond very similar to the one voters approved in 2024.
$50 million for career and technical education — a workforce-centric centerpiece of educational policy both locally and nationally — for improving programs and facilities in public schools statewide via a grant pool administered by the state education department.  
$50 million for the cultural economy, including $45 million for Secretary of State Gregg Amore’s much-pined-for state history center. It’s less than the $60 million Amore asked for to house Rhode Island’s most cherished and delicate artifacts, but the governor hopes Amore could make up the $15 million difference with some alternate funding sources. The remaining $5 million in this bond would fund preservation grants for municipalities and nonprofits.

5. No fiscal cliff, no service returns either for RIPTA
After declining to fill a $32.6 million dollar deficit in his recommended fiscal year 2026 budget, McKee pledged in his State of the State speech to “fully close” the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority’s (RIPTA) projected $13.8 million deficit for fiscal 2027.
McKee recommends a $9.3 million annual increase to RIPTA’s share of the state’s Highway Maintenance Account, funded primarily by vehicle registration fees, from $5 million to $14.3 million.
Also plugging RIPTA’s deficit would be $1 million generated from a proposed increase in fees assessed per passenger on cruise ships that visit Newport. Since 2024, cruise ships have been charged $10 per passenger embarking or boarding from the city by the sea — all of which has been collected by the municipality. McKee proposes increasing the fee by $5 to $15.
McKee also recommends a $3.5 million allocation of capital funds toward bus purchases — money the quasi-governmental agency had taken out of its operating budget.
RIPTA will continue to receive the 2-cent gas tax increase approved by lawmakers last year, even as Gov. Dan McKee has pledged to roll back the overall tax.
The governor’s commitment is still not enough to restore service to what it was before last fall, when RIPTA reduced service on 46 of its 67 bus lines — the most significant cuts in the agency’s 59-year history.
So why not add more revenue?
“This was their proposal and we filled that gap,” Andrea Palagi, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, said Thursday.
RIPTA CEO Christopher Durand thanked McKee for plugging the agency’s latest financial gap.
“This investment affirms the progress we have made over the past year to stabilize our finances, operate more efficiently, and better align service with the needs of riders and employers across the state,” he said in a statement to Rhode Island Current. “Through more than $30 million in cost-savings measures, increased federal reimbursements, and new revenue sources, RIPTA has taken meaningful steps to strengthen its long-term sustainability while continuing to serve the people who rely on transit every day.”

6. Truck tolls still stalled, bridge oversight returning in-house at RIDOT
Keep waiting for the state to restart its truck tolling program. 
McKee’s administration had anticipated $10 million in revenue for fiscal 2026, but the gantries set up on state highways under the Gina Raimondo-era RhodeWorks program still remain offline. That’s because state transportation officials found much of the equipment needs to either be replaced or updated before tractor trailers get tolled again.
Officials declined to say when the gantries will reactivate, just that it won’t be before June 30. Whenever they do turn on in the upcoming fiscal year, McKee’s budget recommendation assumes the tolls will bring in $20 million into the state’s coffers, increasing to $40 million in annual revenue starting in fiscal 2028.
Come July 1, the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) could hire two new civil engineers to provide “inspection oversight” over the state’s inventory of 1,206 bridges, costing $356,492 in state funding.
RIDOT Director Peter Alviti Jr. told lawmakers during a Nov. 13 oversight hearing on the Washington Bridge that the department had no in-house ability to check the adequacy of work of contractors who maintain and inspect Rhode Island’s bridges.
Helena Buonanno Foulkes, McKee’s 2026 Democratic gubernatorial rival, has called for the creation of an “Office of Accountability” within RIDOT responsible for oversight and making sure contracts are fair and the work is being done.
7. New education funding formula? What new education funding formula?
This year, like last, McKee wants to give an incremental boost to the numbers behind the formula to determine the state’s share of public education costs, hopefully redirecting more money to school districts with higher numbers of students living in poverty. 
Overall, the governor’s proposal represents a $17.5 million raise for per-pupil formula aid, or a 3.1% increase from last year. The so-called “student success factor” would rise from 40% to 43% in the funding formula and would account for $14.2 million additional K-12 aid. 
The state is using October enrollment data as the baseline for its formula calculations. That autumnal data led to some troubles last year when the state undercounted the amount of multilingual learners as well as the amount of children living in poverty, but Daniels said the state is “in better shape” this year because of improved data matching work across certain state agencies. “There was a big swing last year, so we really focused a lot on data accuracy,” he said. “I don’t know that we’re fully there yet.” 
Meanwhile, the recently publicized report of a Rhode Island Foundation commission shows how the state could forge a new calculation of what to give school districts. While consideration of this new algebra is underway at the General Assembly — the state Senate is set to receive a presentation on the retooled funding formula Thursday, for instance — McKee’s team is sticking to the method of bean counting the state has relied on for approximately 15 years. When a reporter asked why McKee hadn’t opted for the shiny new formula in this year’s budget, Daniels joked, “Well, it came out 10 days ago, and it cost $600 million.” 
Daniels then took a more serious tone and noted the commission’s report has “some very thoughtful ideas” but the fiscal forecast does make it look “difficult” for the state to absorb even more education costs than it already does. 
McKee is also proposing a $2.5 million increase for high-cost special education categorical funding for a total of $20 million. High cost special education is defined as students whose needs are more than quadruple the formula’s most core instructional amount. 
8. He wants the (veto) power 
After landing in legislative purgatory following the fiscal 2026 budget process — McKee declined to sign the final spending plan but refused to veto it either — he’s back with the perennial solution of executive branches past: a line-item veto.  
Rhode Island is an outlier — one of only six states that don’t let their executive branch reject individual items within their annual budget. But the path to changing the state’s constitution is long and onerous. Without a constitutional convention, McKee’s push for more power must first pass muster with the Rhode Island General Assembly and then with voters as a ballot question.
There is no direct cost for the policy change. So why was it included in McKee’s budget proposal — listed as an “affordability initiative” in a handout supplied to reporters?
“It relates to the administration of the budget,” Daniels said. “We view this as an area where we can have long-term cost containment.”
The Rhode Island General Assembly would still be able to override executive vetoes by a three-fifths majority vote in both chambers. 
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson did not address McKee’s veto plan in a joint statement Thursday.
“The submission of the Governor’s budget today signals the start of a very public budget process over the next several months,” they said. “The respective House and Senate Finance Committees will carefully review all of the proposals at televised hearings and we encourage all interested parties to provide in-person or written testimony.”

9. A Band-Aid for a bleeding health care system 
The governor proposed modest increases in Medicaid reimbursement rates and accompanying funding for cash-strapped hospitals, nursing homes and health centers, and the providers who work within them.
Rather than relying on the July 1 reimbursement rates recommended by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, McKee’s administration proposes a slightly lower, 2.5% increase for hospitals, nursing homes and federally qualified health centers to match the state’s projected revenue growth.
Daniels acknowledged this would not be welcomed by health care providers and facilities. “Yes, you probably want more, but you are going to get what we’re getting,” he said. 
This, on top of regularly scheduled increases in hospital licensing fees based on updated patient revenue figures, would pad state coffers with another $232.5 million in fiscal 2027.
Nearly $120 million in inflation-adjusted reimbursement increases ($46 million from state coffers) for home health aides and providers who work with people with developmental disabilities and young children will be doled out over two years, rather than a single year as the Rhode Island Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner recommended. 
But the health insurance commissioner would be able to wield more power over insurers that fail to meet state caps on annual premium increases, an answer to the double-digit insurance hikes that marked the 2024 and 2025 rate review processes. 
There’s no money for Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital as the drawn-out sale reaches decision day, but the executive branch is working closely with the Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General on contingency planning, Daniels said.
10. More beds for Veterans in Bristol 
McKee’s office pledged in October that he wouldn’t make any cuts to the Rhode Island Veterans Home in Bristol. The governor not only stuck to that promise but wants to commit a potential $3 million in fiscal year 2027 as part of a two-year plan that would reopen 16 beds for veterans on the campus. 
The 16 beds represent half the full capacity of the Foxtrot neighborhood, which has been closed since the pandemic due to a lack of staff needed to tend to residents in the unit. McKee’s allotment provides for up to 22 full-time resident care roles, plus two more jobs for administrative tasks like training, recruitment and retention. The governor’s budget estimates the Veterans Home could reach its full occupancy of 208 beds in fiscal year 2028.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix) The Florida House has again passed legislation (HB 133) dropping the minimum age to purchase rifles and other long guns from 21 to 18. The vote was 74-37, with five Republicans joining the majority of Democrats in opposing it and one Democrat (Jose Alvarez from Osceola County) supporting the measure.
But for the fourth year in a row, the likelihood of the state repealing the law is doubtful, as a companion bill in the Senate has yet to be filed. A similar situation has played out during the past three legislative sessions, with the measure passing the House and dying in the Senate.
Florida lawmakers raised the age to purchase a long gun from 18 to 21 as part of the 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act, in the immediate aftermath of the mass shooting in Parkland that resulted in the deaths of 17 people.
The measure under debate also would allow a person 18 or older to purchase a handgun from a private seller, although a federal ban prohibits anyone under 21 from purchasing a handgun from a federal firearms licensee.
Rep. Robin Bartleman, D-Weston, said lowering the legal age would contribute further to what she said is an erosion of gun safety in Florida.
“We don’t require permits,” she said. “We don’t require training to own a gun. We don’t require safe gun storage, and now we allow everyone to open carry, so literally these 18 to 21 year olds who are not fully developed, who are not thinking rationally, who cannot think of consequences of the actions, actually can lawfully carry their AR-15 on their back and walk around. That’s a dangerous situation.”
Rep. Dean Black, R-Jacksonville, went on an extended discussion about how the debate about gun violence wasn’t about guns at all. The crisis is “with us,” he argued, adding that mass shootings became a phenomenon only over the past three decades. Instead, he said, the House could be talking about the breakdown of the two-parent family and the loss of faith.
“We could talk about things that really might get us somewhere, but we have this distraction, and history over centuries teaches us that that’s not the answer, because it didn’t happen back then, yet it happens today,” Black said. 
Rep. Christine Hunschofsky, D-Parkland, was mayor of that city when the shooting happened in 2018. She said the bipartisan vote in the Legislature to raise the age was “because people decided then that the cost of doing nothing was too high and was something that they wouldn’t be able to live with. 
“I feel that going back on what was done then, the political courage that was done then, would be devastating and heartbreaking, because it’s so hard to find that kind of bipartisan political courage these days,” she said.
The effort to raise the legal age has been supported by Gov. Ron DeSantis and gained momentum this spring when Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced he would not defend the law after a federal appeals court again upheld its constitutionality after it was challenged in federal court by the NRA.
“If the NRA decides to seek further review at SCOTUS, I am directing my office not to defend this law,” Uthmeier said in March, not long after DeSantis appointed him to his office. “Men and women old enough to fight and die for our country should be able to purchase firearms to defend themselves and their families.”
Twenty-one states have raised the age to purchase a long gun to 21 in America, according to Everytown for Gun Safety.
The bill sponsor, Rep. Tyler Sirois, R-Merritt Island, said he was attempting to correct an inequity in Florida law. 
“This country has a problem with school shootings, but the answer to that is not to infringe upon the constitutional rights of law-abiding people,” he said.
Among those watching the debate from the gallery was De’ja Charles, 20, a student at Florida A&M University and a member of Students Demand Action, a gun safety group. 
“We know that 18 to 20 year-olds are three times more likely to commit gun homicides, as opposed to those over 21,” she said, citing statistics compiled by Everytown for Gun Safety. 
“We should be trying to make it safer in Florida for us to live our lives. There should be Parkland victims here today and it’s difficult to have the courage to express your views when you have representatives that are blatantly just going against it.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/0-1-2-1024x771.jpeg,,,2026-01-15 16:57:22.688440

Jeff Landry said he intends to change the role of the state Office of the Inspector General, an agency that acts as a watchdog over public officials and is tasked with rooting out government corruption. 

The governor has replaced longtime Inspector General Stephen Street, who has held the job since 2008, with Angele Davis, who was commissioner of administration and budget czar for former Gov. Bobby Jindal. Street’s most recent term, which started in 2020, expired this week. 
But the governor’s vision for the reworked state inspector general office goes beyond just a personnel change. He said at a news conference Thursday that the inspector general duties overlapped too much with the functions of the legislative auditor, whose staff also conducts investigations into government fraud and waste.

Landry said some of the changes he wants to make require state law to be changed through the Louisiana Legislature. He plans to back bills to change the inspector general’s office in the upcoming lawmaking session that starts March 9. 
While not giving many details about his proposal, the governor said he didn’t think the inspector general’s office should be designated a law enforcement agency as it is now.  He also said the “new” inspector general’s office would be “connected to optimization and efficiency within state government.” 
The inspector general’s office was set up in state law as part of a wider ethics and anti-corruption legislative package Jindal pushed during his first few months as governor in 2008. Prior to that time, governors had employed inspector generals through executive order. 

An overhaul of the office could align with other dramatic changes Landry has made to state government entities that serve as a watchdog and check on state officials’ power. 
In 2024, Landry pushed through significant changes to the Louisiana Board of Ethics that weakened its independence and brought the agency further under the governor’s control.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX 
While the legislative auditor and inspector general share some overlapping functions, as the governor said, the two positions are structured differently. In general, legislators have more direct authority over the legislative auditor than the governor does over the inspector general. 
The inspector general is nominated by the governor and confirmed by the Louisiana Senate to serve a six-year term. The person’s time in office intentionally doesn’t line up with the governor’s or state lawmakers’ four-year terms in order to somewhat insulate the inspector general from political pressure. 
The legislative auditor, currently Mike Waguespack, is voted into office by state lawmakers and serves no specific term, though he or she must be a certified public accountant. Waguespack was a CPA before he was elected sheriff of Assumption Parish, a role held from 2000-16.  
Street, an attorney, was on the staff at the state’s Third Circuit Court of Appeal and the Louisiana attorney general’s office before becoming inspector general.
“Serving 18 years as Louisiana’s Inspector General has been one of the great honors of my life, both personally and professionally,” Street said in a written statement Thursday. 
Both the inspector general and legislative auditor have subpoena power, meaning they can compel a person to testify or hand over documents, but who approves their subpoenas differs. 

The legislative auditor can only subpoena people if the Legislative Audit Advisory Council, made up of the state lawmakers who help hire the auditor, agrees to do so. The inspector general gets approval for his subpoenas from a state judge with the 19th Judicial District in Baton Rouge.

Posthumus, a Republican from Rockford, said in a press release that he decided when he first ran in 2020 that he would serve only three terms, honoring the term limits law in effect at the time that restricted House members to six years.
“I plan to stick to that commitment,” Posthumus said.
The law changed in 2022 to an overall limit of 12 years to be served between either the state House or Senate.
Posthumus was elected in 2020 to represent the 73rd House District. Following redistricting, he was elected in 2022 and reelected in 2024 in the 90th District. Both districts are solidly Republican. 
He was subsequently chosen by his GOP colleagues to serve as majority floor leader, the second highest position next to the Speaker, in 2022 and again in 2024.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“It has been the privilege of my life to serve Kent County and the people of Michigan,” Posthumus said, adding that announcing his decision now would give voters time to choose “the best possible candidate” to replace him.
He cited several accomplishments during his tenure, including what he described as cutting the state budget for the first time outside periods of war or recession and increasing budget transparency.
Posthumus also praised fellow lawmakers from both parties, acknowledging sharp partisan divisions while emphasizing a shared goal of improving the state.
“We live in an era of hyper partisanship, and the gap between Republicans and Democrats is enormous,” Posthumus stated. “The solutions we offer are often diametrically opposed to one another. However, the one thing that unites us is the desire to leave Michigan better than we found it.”
He said he will continue working through the end of the year and remain active in efforts to help Republicans retain control of the House. Posthumus also expressed support for House Speaker Matt Hall returning to the post in 2027 under a Republican governor.
Posthumus noted that serving in the Legislature held special meaning because his father and sister also previously served in the state Legislature.
He thanked his constituents, colleagues, staff and family for their support, calling his time in office “a true honor.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1536-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 16:57:22.688440

Josh Stein speaks to reporters about western North Carolina recovery on Jan. 15, 2026. (Photo: Christine Zhu/NC Newsline)North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein thanked federal officials Thursday for finally approving some Helene survivors’ applications for disaster relief.
It’s a good step, he said, but he’ll continue to ask Congress for an additional $13.5 billion to help western North Carolina recover from the devastating effects of the 2024 hurricane.
In the meantime, FEMA has taken more than a year to process some aid applications.
“The longer the delay in federal funding and getting programs up and running, the worse it is for western North Carolina recovery,” Stein said. 
U.S. Rep. Chuck Edwards (R-NC11) announced Wednesday that FEMA will release $116 million in Helene relief. $72 million is from the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Public Assistance program, and the remaining $44.6 million comes through the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program.
Under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, local governments use federal disaster money to buy land from homeowners whose property is in a flood zone. 
“The way it works is, they buy the property, and then it becomes green space forever, so that there won’t be anybody who experiences pain if there is future flooding,” Stein said. 
A Buncombe County woman was waiting for a buyout for her house in Swannanoa after it was destroyed in the storm, Stein said. She hasn’t been able to live there, sell it, or rebuild it, but she’s been stuck paying the mortgage on the property for more than a year while waiting for FEMA to release the money for the buyout, he explained.
“There were 560 applications of homeowners who similarly said, ‘Please, my house is in a flood zone. I am ready for you to acquire my property,’” Stein said.
The funding released Wednesday will allow some of those transactions to move forward, like elevating 14 homes in Beaufort County.
”Not all of it’s been solved yet,” Stein said. “I don’t want to overstate it, but what a constructive development yesterday was.”
In the 16 months since Hurricane Helene wreaked havoc on the western portion of the state, North Carolina has dedicated more than $3.1 billion towards recovery efforts, Stein wrote in his Wednesday letter to the congressional delegation. Previously, Congress had allocated $7 billion in federal funding towards recovery from the catastrophic storm.
But that’s still a small fraction of estimated $60 billion in damages Helene caused in North Carolina.
North Carolina first asked for the additional $13.5 billion in September 2025.
According to the governor’s office, the appropriation request includes: 

$1.77 billion to repair roads
$8.37 billion to support homeowners in rebuilding their homes
$1.99 billion to help local governments stay afloat
$540 million to restore water infrastructure systems

Stein, a Democrat, said the request has the bipartisan support of the state’s congressional delegation.
“There was just unanimity that Washington needs to do more,” he said.
Stein asks lawmakers for drone legislation
Following Helene, the state used drones to survey damage, search for survivors, and direct rescue teams. Now, there are new concerns over the technology. 
Stein serves as co-chair of the Council of Governments, a group that focuses on national security, cybersecurity, and natural disasters.
“It quickly became apparent to our group that the malicious use of drones can become a real problem around the country,” Stein said. “The potential that weaponized drones can be used by bad actors to attack large public gatherings for critical infrastructure — it isn’t fiction.”
In December, Congress passed the Safer Skies Act, allowing state law enforcement to address the threat of drones, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act. Trump signed it into law. 
Previously, state and local officials could not shoot down suspicious drones unless they were suspected of delivering contraband to prisons. Otherwise, they could only go after the drone operator.
“Now, under the Safer Skies Act, if a state or local government goes through a federal training program, they can then have the authority to, when it’s appropriate, when there is a risk, to actually take action against a specific drone,” Stein said.
“The current law only holds accountable the person who is directing the drone, but that person may be miles away and you have no idea who they are,” Stein continued. “But the drone is right there and presents a real and clear present danger. And so that’s the change in federal law that we have been seeking.”
N.C. Public Safety Secretary Jeff Smythe said states will need to set their own rules for state and local officials. He said North Carolina’s approach will focus on protecting critical infrastructure, like power generation facilities, water systems, ports, transportation hubs and communication networks.  
Smythe also wants to ensure that law enforcement and correctional officers have clear rules of engagement, and follow federal law while respecting privacy. 
“This is not about expanding surveillance,” Smythe said. “It’s about preventing harm and keeping pace with modern risks.”
Stein said he’s working on a draft bill to set up a state framework, but did not share further details. 
“We need to strengthen our law to make sure that it takes care of all of the major risks,” Stein said.

Rucker sponsored the bill that would allow for over-the-counter sale of ivermectin, which passed in Senate Health on Thursday and now advances to Senate Judiciary. (Photo by Will Price/West Virginia Legislative Photography)For a second year, members of the Senate Health Committee advanced a bill Thursday to allow pharmacists to sell ivermectin, a medication generally prescribed to treat people with topical conditions or infections that stem from parasitic worms, over-the-counter and without a prescription.
Senate Bill 42 would allow individuals to request ivermectin from pharmacists without having a doctor’s order for treatment of a specific condition or dosage. 
The bill was sponsored by Sen. Patricia Rucker, R-Jefferson, who said she believed risks associated with ivermectin use are minor. She compared it to Tylenol, which can be abused if used irresponsibly but is relatively safe in appropriate doses.
“There are people who have destroyed their stomachs by taking too many over-the-counter medications. It is absolutely a responsibility of the individuals and the pharmacists,” Rucker said. “I do believe that pharmacists have a very good knowledge of what it is that they are not only dispensing, they’re there to educate the consumer when the consumer requests any drugs, whether it is with a prescription or without a prescription.”
Per the proposed bill, no consultation with the pharmacist or a doctor would be required before purchasing the medication. Pharmacists would provide individuals who request the drug with an information sheet on uses approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration. While pharmacists “may” sell the drug, there is no requirement for them to do so.
Pharmacists who sell the medication would be immune from any civil, criminal or professional actions that could arise from someone taking it.
Per the FDA, ivermectin is only authorized for use in humans at specific doses to treat some parasitic worms and, topically, for head lice and skin conditions like rosacea.
Sen. Tom Takubo, R-Kanawha, said he had concerns about over-the-counter access to ivermectin without limits on dosages, especially when it comes to off-label uses. If taken in high doses, he said, the medication can be dangerous.
“My biggest concern with this particular bill … is just the dose and quantity,” Takubo, a doctor by trade, said. “If someone doesn’t know what dose of ivermectin or how much to take then, yes, there are significant toxicities.”
He said pharmacists can only share the information they have. Since there is no scientific evidence or FDA authorization showing that the medication treats antiviral conditions or other illnesses, specifying an appropriate dosage in those uses would be difficult for the pharmacist.
Complications from over-usage, Takubo said, can include a drop in blood pressure, an increase in heart rate, seizures, blindness and the development of Steven Johnson Syndrome, a serious disorder in the skin and mucus membranes that causes skin to shed off.
“My only concern is there’s nothing that prohibits [someone receiving then taking too much of the drug],” Takubo said. “I think this is probably something that will never or rarely ever get used, so it’d be nice if there would be some safeguard or some limit.”
Last year, a similar bill passed out of Senate Health. That bill, however, hinged on over-the-counter access only being possible if the FDA approved the drug for human use in wider circumstances than currently allowed. The bill ultimately died in the Senate Judiciary, where it was not brought up for consideration.
Interest in and pushes for the wider use of ivermectin became common during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, when people alleged that the drug could help treat infections from the virus. To date, no clinical trials or peer-reviewed evidence have been accepted by the FDA to support such claims. 
The drug became a common talking point for COVID-19 conspiracists and, due to this misinformation, health leaders urged the public not to use the drug for off-label purposes, citing concerns over other medications that could be contraindicated and different formulations of it that could be safe for animal consumption but not for humans.
Takubo, a pulmonologist, said that he and other doctors attempted to use ivermectin in severely ill patients in the early days of COVID-19. Even at the highest doses, he said, it did not work. Months later, studies were released showing it as ineffective.
“I ran the dose to very toxic levels. We did everything we could to try to save people,” Takubo said. “It just didn’t work.”
Sen. Kevan Bartlett, R-Kanawha, said that while he was “uncomfortable” getting COVID-19 vaccination boosters after receiving an initial dose, he did take ivermectin when he caught the virus. While he acknowledged there was no scientific or medical evidence showing its efficacy, he said his symptoms “significantly diminished” within two days.
“More and more, we need to look for ways to let West Virginians make informed choices and less opportunity [for us] to just dictate choices from the dome here or the dome in Washington,” Bartlett said. “So I support the freedom that comes with this bill in this small particular area.”
Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, called ivermectin a “political football.” Rucker said seeing similar bills implemented in other states inspired her to introduce it again here. But Garcia said that just because other places were doing it didn’t make it “the right thing to do.”
“I do think there are some risks to a bill like this,” Garcia said. “I think there are a lot more important things to do [in the Senate Health Committee], and this should not be a priority.”
The bill will now advance to the Senate Judiciary for lawmakers there to consider.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Chris Jones, an author, researcher and Iowa water quality advocate, launched his campaign for Iowa secretary of agriculture Thursday outside of Des Moines Water Works. 
Jones’ platform for the role includes a more diversified agricultural landscape, more regulations on polluters and concentrated feeding operations and greater access to locally grown food. 
“We need a secretary of agriculture that is for the people … and not just for corporate agriculture,” Jones said. “And so that’s what I endeavor to do if I’m elected secretary of agriculture.”

Jones was formerly a research engineer studying Iowa water quality at the University of Iowa. He spoke Thursday in front of Des Moines Water Works to highlight the fact that the Raccoon River, one of the drinking water sources for central Iowa, had nitrate concentrations in excess of federal safe drinking water standards. 
“So clearly, here in Iowa, we are not getting the environmental outcomes that we want from this agricultural production system,” Jones said. 
Des Moines Water Works has been running its nitrate removal system since Jan. 6 in order to continue providing drinking water within safe drinking water limits. Over the summer, nitrate concentrations were so high in the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers following a wet spring, that the utility issued a lawn watering ban to decrease demand on the system and remain within safe limits. 
Jones said the nitrate levels, which have remained high through the fall and winter, are due to row crop and animal agriculture systems upstream. Jones’ writings and his book, “The Swine Republic,” center largely on the same theme. 
This stance, and his calls for Iowa to transition away from corn and soybean farming, has led some, including incumbent Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig, to say Jones is anti-farmer. 
Jones said he “wants what’s best for farmers” and that means deviating from current production models. Jones said the current agricultural model — of mostly large operation corn and soybean farms and concentrated livestock feeding operations — has not been prosperous and has led to a decline in rural populations and essential services. 
“I hope farmers see that I want what’s best for them – I want our farmers to be prosperous,” Jones said. “Iowa cannot be prosperous if farmers aren’t prosperous.” 
He also said the role of secretary of agriculture should not be a “farmer popularity contest” and he wants non-farming Iowans to vote for him as well because “agriculture policy is too important just to leave it to agriculture to make the decisions.” 
Jones is running for the Democratic nomination against farmer Wade Dooley who announced his campaign Monday. 
Jones said more diverse cropping and livestock systems would fix a lot of the current problems facing agriculture, including, water pollution, low prices for corn and the ongoing outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza. 
That means different crops, like oats, for example, need to be subsidized and livestock production should transition to “more traditional” methods outside of animal confinement, Jones said. 
“Instead of continuously trying to find what we can do with more and more and more corn, maybe let’s think about growing something else,” Jones said. 
In his writing, Jones has criticized both the Republican and Democratic parties’ approaches to agriculture and water protections, but he said he is not worried his critiques will impact his campaign. 
“I have my own views on things, and they’re not molded by party politics,” Jones said. 
Jones will host a campaign kickoff Thursday at Confluence Brewing in Des Moines and a Clean Water Town Hall in Grinnell Jan. 24.

(Via Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)For the second year in a row, the Florida House has greenlit a measure requiring all businesses to use a federal verification tool to determine whether new hires can legally work in the country.
HB 197, sponsored by Seminole Republican Rep. Berny Jacques, would mandate that all employers use the online database called E-Verify. This expands a 2023 law championed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, which demanded E-Verify for public businesses and private ones with more than 25 employees.
This is the second year the E-Verify bill has cleared the House. Last year, the measure never gained traction in the Senate. It remains to be seen whether its identical companion bill, filed by Sen. Jonathan Martin, will be scheduled for a committee hearing.
Rep. Berny Jacques introduces his E-Verify bill on the House Floor on Jan. 15, 2026. (Via Liv Caputo/Florida Phoenix)
“If this bill passes, it would expose a lot of law breakers that are harming Floridians, that are harming law abiding people who want to get into the workforce, and harming law abiding businesses,” Jaques said Thursday from the House floor.
“It’s time for us to finally get this done.”
The bill passed in an 80 to 30 vote, with four Democrats voting with the Republican majority and two Republicans voting with the Democrats.
Of note, more than 475,000 small businesses in Florida have fewer than 20 employees, according to a 2025 report by the Small Business Administration. Not counting businesses without employees — of which there are more than 2 million — there are fewer than 518,000 small businesses in Florida.
Jacques’ bill is emblematic of a nationwide push to tighten immigration laws, spearheaded by President Donald Trump and most clearly mirrored in Florida. Trump has mobilized Border Patrol within the country to supplant and aid ICE while the Sunshine State exists as the first (and only) in the nation to require all of its counties to partner with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Under DeSantis, Florida also constructed the first state-run migrant detention center, nicknamed “Alligator Alcatraz.” States including Indiana, Nebraska, and Louisiana quickly followed suit.
‘Fake fix’?
Not all were in support of Jacques’ bills. Democrats cited fears of undue costs on small business owners and past reports of unreliability within the E-Verify system.
“We don’t need this fake fix forcing private employers to use a broken and unreliable federal database in the form of a big government mandate,” said Rep. Dotie Joseph, a North Miami Democrat. “It’s bad for business and bad for Florida.”
Others pointed to alleged burdens on small businesses, with Rep. Yvette Hinson pointing to a 2010 Bloomberg study estimating that E-Verify implementation cost small businesses $81 million.
Although E-Verify requires documents like an I-9 to prove work authorization, cases of identity theft have permeated the platform. E-Verify can determine whether documents are valid, but it can’t always determine whether they are the valid documents of a person besides the potential new hire, according to the Center for Immigration Studies.
But Jacques pushed back. He argued that E-Verify has been in use since 1996, and that some small businesses contracting with public agencies are also required to use the database.
“This is nothing new,” he said.
In 2023, then-Sen. Blaise Ingoglia sponsored the law to require private businesses with at least 25 employees to use E-Verify. It was part of a large immigration package that also required Medicaid-accepting hospitals to annually report how many undocumented immigrants they treat.
Despite this, Florida Republicans criticized the DeSantis administration for failing to penalize businesses that hadn’t been using E-Verify. The statute requires businesses that ignore E-Verify laws three times within two years to face a $1,000 fine per day.
DeSantis, in turn, sent out warning letters to 40 companies either ignoring or refusing to implement E-Verify.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_3602-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-15 16:57:22.688440

Only Prisma entered a bid for the five-year operating contract for the center, scheduled to open in March. No other companies applied, according to documents from the state’s procurement agency.
The state’s largest hospital system will earn $825,000 annually to run the clinic, which will boast the most powerful MRI scanner in the state. Also at the center, those diagnosed with Alzheimer’s will have the option to undergo treatment with recently approved drugs meant to slow the disease’s progression.
Neurologists and radiologists with the necessary training to diagnose the most complicated cases of Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia will work out of the clinic, Julius Fridriksson, USC’s vice president for research previously told the SC Daily Gazette.
USC seeks partner for new $30M brain health center

Prisma is already USC’s largest partner when it comes to brain health.
USC renovated a 75,000-square-foot building the school owns on the Prisma Health Richland Hospital campus to serve as the main hub in a network of seven clinics already set up across the state. While awaiting the new center’s completion, USC medical school doctors have been booking appointments four days a week in university-leased space within the neurology department of the hospital.
Prisma also was the partner in the first of those satellite clinics, founded in an effort to increase access to brain-related disease research and cutting-edge treatments in rural areas. The clinic, located in Winnsboro, opened two years ago.
Prisma-based locations in Sumter and Seneca followed the Winnsboro clinic.
Plus, Lexington Health is USC’s partner for a clinic in West Columbia. HopeHealth is the partner for clinics in Orangeburg and Darlington.
Since opening the clinic network has seen more than 1,000 patients, and the demand keeps increasing.
USC runs the network with $5 million in taxpayer dollars annually. The college is seeking an additional $1.5 annually in the upcoming budget packaged to cover the cost of the Prisma contract and add more rural clinics. The school has yet to determine the locations of those additional clinics, USC spokesman Jeff Stensland said.
The main brain health clinic is located a half mile from the site of USC’s new $300 million School of Medicine campus, set for completion in 2027, and a $350 million neurological hospital and rehabilitation center planned for downtown Columbia’s BullStreet District.
The Legislature provided $150 million this year toward the specialized hospital for neurological diseases. USC is seeking an additional $25.5 million annually to cover hospital operations.
Prior state budgets collectively provided about $200 million toward building the new medical school. Now, USC is asking legislators to set aside an additional $90 million so it can add a new pharmacy school to the medical campus as well.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/braincenter-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-15 16:57:22.688440

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, chair and vice chair, respectively, of the Democratic Governors Association, released a joint statement Thursday saying the Trump administration had “unleashed chaos and division in Minnesota.” They later urged Republican governors to also speak against Trump’s threat of military action. 
“Communities across the nation are on edge after a woman was killed and a man was shot. Threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act is reckless and dangerous,” the governors said. 
Protests in the state followed a fatal shooting by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross, who shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good in south Minneapolis last week. 
Another shooting of a man by an ICE agent Wednesday evening in Minneapolis increased tensions. 
Trump said on Truth Social Thursday that if Minnesota’s “corrupt politicians” did not “stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E.,” he would invoke the Insurrection Act to send in the military to stop protests. The 19th century law grants an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the military from performing domestic law enforcement.
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, is among officials in the state who have called for the federal government to withdraw ICE agents.

“Our country is too divided. In moments like these, real leaders do the right thing and bring people together. You can’t do that by attacking states,” Beshear and Whitmer said. 
“We stand with Governor Walz, who has made it clear that violence is not acceptable and is calling to lower the temperature,” they continued. “We also call on our country’s Republican governors to join us in defending states’ rights by speaking out against these threats for a chaotic and un-American federal takeover.”
Last week, Beshear was critical of the Trump administration’s initial response to the shooting of Good calling it “grossly irresponsible.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0465-2048x1536-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-15 16:57:22.688440

“Nobody’s looking at the bookkeepers,” Lock said.
That’s her job now.
Lock’s position was created after lawmakers passed Senate Bill 60 last year, which expanded the auditor’s access and investigative authority to monitor state spending.
The state Attorney General’s Office has prosecuted numerous cases of criminal activity by state employees over the past two years. One former Department of Social Services employee, Lonna Carroll, was sentenced to seven years in prison for the theft of $1.8 million from the state across multiple years. In response, lawmakers have called on state offices and departments to improve their internal controls and oversight.
State Auditor Rich Sattgast introduced Lock to the legislative budget committee on Tuesday at the Capitol in Pierre.
Lock reviews bookkeeping processes, checks that new hire background checks are performed, and analyzes day-to-day operations to ensure dual controls, separation of duties and other financial controls are in place. She also meets with the fiscal employees in person.
“We want to be sure that the people who actually have access to our state funds are continuously monitored,” Lock told lawmakers.
Sattgast added that Lock will be instrumental in analyzing data from agencies and identifying anomalies or changes to spending. Lock formerly served as the finance officer for the South Dakota Governor’s Office of Economic Development and as an investment accountant for the South Dakota Investment Council.
Information Lock needs in her role will be easier to access once the Bureau of Finance and Management’s Project Bison financial reporting software is online, Lock said. 
State officials outline new safeguards after string of employee criminal cases

Project Bison, which replaces South Dakota’s more than 35-year-old financial reporting system, is expected to come online in July, Bureau of Finance and Management Commissioner Jim Terwilliger said.
“We expect greater efficiencies. We expect having better controls in place from a technology perspective,” Terwilliger said. “That’s something that we work with the State Auditor’s Office on. When it comes to issuing payments, a lot of that will be streamlined electronically.”
In addition to the multimillion-dollar upgrade to the financial reporting system, the bureau leads the state’s Internal Control Board and initiative. Terwilliger told lawmakers that the board reviews procedures and processes to prevent future fraud.
“This has been a multi-year effort in terms of establishing a statewide, consistent framework that’s documented in a consistent manner,” Terwilliger said.

(Photo by Getty Images)A federal judge has ordered the Muscatine County Jail to release an ICE detainee who had been incarcerated for almost a year after a judge ruled in his favor on an asylum request.
Court records indicate Jose Yugar-Cruz, 36, entered the United States in July 2024 after fleeing his home country of Bolivia. In court filings, Yugar-Cruz alleged that while living in Bolivia, he operated a small business and had “refused to facilitate the drug trade by police officials” who then detained him and tortured him.
In the court filings, Yugar-Cruz said he fled to Mexico, entered the United States on foot at the Arizona border, and then “sought out and surrendered” himself to federal immigration officials. He was then taken into custody and jailed, after which he applied for asylum based on the threat of persecution in Bolivia.

In December 2024, a federal immigration judge held a hearing on Yugar-Cruz’s asylum request. According to a lawsuit Yugar-Cruz filed four weeks ago against Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and various Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, the judge ruled in January 2025 that the U.S. government could not send Yugar-Cruz back to Bolivia due to the ongoing threat of torture.
The judge granted Yugar-Cruz “withholding-of-removal relief” — a form of protection for individuals who face persecution if returned to their home country. It prevents the U.S. government from deporting an individual to a country where their life or freedom would be threatened.
In his lawsuit, Yugar-Cruz asserted the government never appealed the immigration judge’s ruling and so he “expected that he would soon be released from detention and allowed to start his life in the United States.”
In February 2025, however, Yugar-Cruz was still being held in the Freeborn County Adult Detention Center in Albert Lea, Minn. While there, the lawsuit claimed, he spoke to ICE officials who first indicated he’d be released in “15 days or so,” but later informed him they would continue to hold him while looking for some third-party country to which he could be deported.
The lawsuit alleged ICE officials proposed that Yugar-Cruz be deported to Argentina, Chile or Paraguay, all of which border Bolivia, but Yugar-Cruz objected, noting that Bolivians, including the police, can easily travel to those countries without a passport. Mexico was proposed as an alternative, but Yugar-Cruz expressed concern officials there would simply deport him to Bolivia.
Lawsuit cites Trump policy on deportations 
On Dec. 3, 2025, Yugar-Cruz was transferred from the Albert Lea jail to the Muscatine County Jail in Iowa.
Nine days later, Yugar-Cruz’s attorney sued the Muscatine County jail administrator, as well as Noem and other Homeland Security officials, alleging they were violating federal law by continuing to detain Yugar-Cruz 11 months after the immigration judge had ruled in his favor.
As part of that lawsuit, Yugar-Cruz’s attorney noted the Trump administration had adopted a practice of deporting people to third-party countries with no guarantee those individuals wouldn’t immediately be sent to their home country, where they faced persecution or torture.
A federal judge in the District of Columbia has ruled the practice amounts to a “widespread effort to evade the government’s legal obligations by doing indirectly what it cannot do directly.”
In recent months, the administration has deported at least 20 individuals to Eswatini and other African nations where they’ve reportedly been jailed indefinitely at maximum-security prisons without charges and without access to legal counsel.
None of the individuals originated from those African countries. They had been convicted of crimes in the United States, but had served their sentences and were released before being detained by ICE and then deported over the objections of human rights organizations.
Yugar-Cruz has no criminal record, according to his attorney’s court filings. His lawsuit alleged violations of his due process rights and the Immigration Nationality Act, and sought his immediate release from the Muscatine County Jail.
Recently, after the U.S. Department of Justice acknowledged the federal government had been attempting, without success, to find a third-party country to accept Yugar-Cruz, District Court Judge Stephen H. Locher ruled in Yugar-Cruz’s favor.
Locher ordered the Muscatine County Jail to work with ICE officials in securing Yugar-Cruz’s immediate release and, on Jan. 7, 2026, ICE officials confirmed for the court that Yugar-Cruz had been discharged from the county jail.
His release remains subject to “reasonable conditions of supervision” by ICE, according to Locher’s order.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is auditing Hennepin Healthcare, which operates Minnesota’s largest safety net hospital, for compliance with immigrant employment eligibility laws.
A memo from hospital leaders to staff on Thursday obtained by the Reformer says DHS issued a subpoena on Jan. 8 for Hennepin Healthcare’s I-9 forms, which are required by federal law to verify workers’ identities and employment eligibility. The documents include workers’ full names, home addresses, Social Security numbers and employment eligibility documentation.
“We are complying with this legal requirement, as failure to do so could result in civil or criminal penalties,” the memo says, which is signed by co-interim administrators J. Kevin Croston and David Hough.
Homeland Security did not respond to a Reformer email seeking comment.
The subpoena was issued less than a week after a Hennepin County commissioner and state legislators showed up at HCMC to tell ICE agents to leave the bedside of a patient they had been guarding despite not having a judicial warrant, according to immigrant advocacy group Unidos MN.
Unidos MN held a news conference with HCMC staff and elected officials on Jan. 6, blasting the ICE agents’ behavior, saying the patient was denied family visits and shackled to the bed.
ICE agents have been guarding another patient around the clock for more than a week over the objections of medical staff, according to two people with knowledge of the situation who were granted anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.
Hennepin County Commissioner Angela Conley called the employment audit a “retaliatory move,” in a news conference on Wednesday with other local elected leaders.
“ICE agents have occupied our safety-net hospital for the last week,” Conley said. “They have been asked to leave multiple times given that there has been no judicially signed warrant presented to hospital leadership.”
Earlier this week, Hennepin County Board commissioners voted unanimously to condemn ICE and called for their removal from Minnesota.
Hennepin Healthcare is far from alone in facing government scrutiny, as the Trump administration carries out an unprecedented immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota, with more than 2,000 federal agents on the ground in what DHS calls its largest operation ever.
Homeland Security Investigations is issuing a torrent of subpoenas to small and medium-sized businesses for employment records, according to immigration attorneys who spoke to the Star Tribune.
Michael Davis, an attorney specializing in immigration law, told the paper he’s handling several cases a week when he would usually only see a handful each year. He said businesses are being hit with heavy fines for simple paperwork errors.
“This is part of the administration’s overall effort not just to ensure compliance, but to make it more difficult for businesses to operate,” Davis said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MG_9579-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 15:57:48.888157

This is the prepared text of Gov. Jared Polis’ 2026 State of the State address to the Colorado General Assembly, which he delivered at about 11 a.m., Jan. 15.
Your Excellencies Madam Speaker and President Coleman, and Minority Leaders Caldwell and Simpson, thank you, welcome to my final State of the State address. I am truly humbled to be here as your Honorable Governor. It has been such an honor to be your Governor.
To my family, who have been on this journey since day one. Thank you, Marlon, for your unwavering support and for your inspiring work as Colorado’s First Gentleman on animal protection, recycling and composting, voter participation, and LGBTQ rights, and for being an incredible father to our children. I know you’re relieved that we are nearing the end. To my mom and dad, who have been here every step of the way. My sister and brother, who are amazing. To my kids, you should be in school!
To my friend and partner on this long journey, my Lieutenant Governor, Dianne Primavera. Thank you for all you do every single day to serve our state. Your strong moral compass, passion and strength have been an inspiration to our administration and helped us to navigate so many hard issues. Our state is better because of your service.
To my chiefs of staff, Lisa, Rick, Alec, David, thank you for steering the ship with joy, fortitude, and steadfast dedication to our fellow Coloradans.
And to my senior staff, cabinet, and our incredible team across state government who have contributed to my administration, thank you. It is with your expertise and commitment to service that we’ve achieved even bigger and bolder than we could have imagined.
Seven years ago, I stepped up to the plate as your Governor: baseball aficionado, gamer, tech geek, a head mostly full of hair, ever-hopeful Rockies fan, well, hopeful back then.
At the time, I certainly couldn’t have predicted all that we would face as a state and a nation.
There’s all that we planned and worked for to put Colorado ahead of the curve. Shared achievements like:
Delivering on the promise of free kindergarten and preschool, saving families thousands and giving our youngest learners a strong start.
Building out low-cost clean energy for more Coloradans to save money on energy bills, protecting our air and water, and creating good-paying jobs.








Making it easier and more affordable – even free in many cases – to get the skills needed to get a good job.
Breaking down barriers to housing for Coloradans at every budget. Getting rid of the Budget Stabilization Factor and fully funding our schools.
Cutting income taxes three times and property taxes five times while supercharging the earned income and child tax credits. Establishing the Family Affordability Tax Credit, which helped cut child poverty rates by nearly 41%. Today, Colorado boasts the lowest childhood poverty rate in the nation.
Generating more than $470 million each year in new funding for our roads, bridges, and transit – with the vast majority of that funding going to roads and bridges.
There’s the “pinch me” moments, when we seized opportunity and we called our shot to deliver monumental achievements for Colorado.
Becoming the new home of the world-renowned Sundance Film Festival.
Keeping the Broncos in Denver with the revitalization of Burnham Yard.
Standing atop Fishers Peak, Colorado’s 42nd state park.
Bringing the M-L-B All-Star game to Colorado, boosting our economy as the world recovered from the pandemic.
Receiving Colorado’s first COVID vaccine shipment, marking a historic scientific achievement and the return to life lived together.
Celebrating President Biden’s designation of Camp Hale as a national monument, an effort I helped begin more than 15 years ago during my time in Congress. First Pup Gia, who is also here with us today, accompanied me to that signing. The Denver Post front page picture celebrating the new monument featured Gia front and center!
Earning national recognition as the epicenter of quantum computing technology.
And then, there’s the curveballs that come with the job. The unforeseen events that altered and shaped the trajectory of our state forever.
COVID was unlike anything we’d ever faced before. While the world plunged into uncertainty, we came together to support our brave and dedicated doctors, nurses, and frontline workers, and charted a path forward to chart hospital capacity.
At the height of the pandemic, we held three press conferences a week to help explain to Coloradans frankly what we knew – and what we didn’t know, too. Leading with data and science, we shared the most up-to-date information to empower Coloradans to make informed decisions, weigh their risks, and choose how to best protect themselves and their families.








And when Washington told states to figure it out for themselves, we all stepped up for Colorado. We quickly expanded life-saving tests, PPE, and when they were finally available, thanks to President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed, vaccines too. and pushed hard to be one of the first states to safely get our schools and economy back up and running.
With the expertise of our Department of Public Health and Environment Director Dr. Jill Ryan and her team, and my then Chief of Staff Lisa Kaufmann, Colorado led the country in wastewater testing, and made it easier and quicker for Coloradans to get a COVID test. I am proud we had among the quickest vaccine uptakes of any state.
In the middle of it all, we came together to deliver on the promises we made long before the pandemic hit. Democrats, Republicans, and my Administration all worked together to keep Coloradans safe while at the same time, passing free preschool and historic transportation funding. When we work together, we do big things.
And because 2020 was the year that kept on giving, we also faced the three largest wildfires in the history of our state. The next year, we faced the Marshall Fire, the most destructive fire in Colorado history. I want to recognize and thank Department of Public Safety Director Stan Hilkey, Director of the Colorado Division of Fire Prevention & Control Mike Morgan, Director of the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management Kevin Klein, Chief of the Colorado State Patrol Matt Packard, Colorado National Guard Adjunct General (and now-acting CPW director – thank you for coming out of retirement) Laura Clellan, and the many, many more Coloradans involved for their steady, skilled leadership through Colorado’s most trying times.
We witnessed horrific mass shootings at the STEM School in Highlands Ranch, Club Q in Colorado Springs, King Soopers in Boulder, and most recently at Evergreen High School. We endured a horrific antisemitic attack on Pearl Street Mall in Boulder.
And grief has also struck right here in our State Capitol, with the sudden and tragic passings of our colleagues Senator Faith Winter and Minority Leader Hugh McKean.
To honor their legacy and all we’ve lost, the work continues. As Faith would say, we will “lift as we rise.”
For all of us here, we’re going to bat for Colorado’s future, to leave our great state even better than we found it.
Seven years ago, some thought our bold goals were far-fetched. I’ve got the receipts, I mean headlines, doubting if I’d be able to get it all done.
From 2019: Will Polis Get Full-Day Kindergarten, Or Will Colorado Give Another Flaky Promise? One year later, headlines read: Colorado’s Free, Full-Day Kindergarten Boosted Enrollment By Nearly 25%.
In my first year, the intrepid reporters at the Colorado Sun published a tracker of my campaign promises. 9News even wrote a song about it!








Now, I appreciate their help holding us accountable for our bold goals. Although, I did notice they stopped keeping track because it’s not as exciting when we keep delivering on our promises.
But for me, it’s always been about delivering real results, not headlines. To me, politics is simple: you say what you’re going to do, and then you do it.
We posted a transparent dashboard to share month-by-month updates with Coloradans on our progress delivering wildly important goals – what we call WIGs – for each agency. We are bringing ease and convenience to government services with mobile DMV offerings and the myColorado app, used by nearly 2 million Coloradans.
And when it comes to turning my bold agenda into a better daily life for Coloradans, we haven’t always succeeded on our first try. But we’ve always stepped back up to the plate – because that’s what we do in Colorado.
We are in this work to make life better, more affordable, safer for all Coloradans.
Meanwhile, over the past 12 months, it seems Washington is in it to break it all down. To make life harder and less affordable. To make Americans feel more fearful, more belligerent, more vulnerable.
In the last month alone, the Trump administration has threatened over $1 billion in funding for Colorado, and is making life more expensive and more difficult across our state.
Mean cuts target short-term support for the most basic and essential needs for Colorado families and threaten child care support that Colorado families and child care centers rely on. The President denied two major disaster relief requests for the Lee and Elk fires and devastating flooding in Western Colorado, hurting Coloradans and our recovery efforts, and went on to veto Lauren Boebert, Michael Bennet, and John Hickenlooper’s unanimous, bipartisan bill to finally complete the pipeline providing clean water to rural Colorado, a project first promised under JFK. All while threatening to dismantle NCAR, a global leader in weather and global sciences, and a crown jewel of American scientific achievement.
That’s before you get to the devastating impacts HR 1 had on our state, gutting our state budget by $1 billion overnight, eliminating Coloradans’ TABOR refunds, and slashing Medicaid and SNAP.
All the while, tariff taxes on Coloradans are driving up costs on everything from groceries to medicine. Trump’s tariffs alone are expected to cost Coloradans on average $1,700 for a single year. Tariffs hurt all of us, and make it unaffordable to live.
Since day one, we’ve worked together to save Coloradans money. To strengthen international trade and make our state the best place to start and grow a business.
Four years ago, I stood here and sang about finding 50 ways to save Coloradans money, and we went on to deliver over 100. We’re saving the average Colorado family of four over $600 dollars a year on income and property taxes, and last year Colorado taxpayers saved nearly $2.5 billion.








Just as we came together during the special session to close corporate tax loopholes, I am hopeful that we can come together again to cut the income tax rate.
We are fighting – hard – to protect every federal dollar owed to Colorado. In partnership with Attorney General Weiser, the state has successfully defended nearly $900 million.
But there’s over $1 billion more lost or at risk from illegal Trump administration cuts.
Washington Republicans – once the self-proclaimed party of states’ rights and small government – today are too often the party of socialism, overreach, and intrusion into people’s daily lives in ways wholly out of the scope of government. Picking corporate winners and losers, co-opting capitalism with cronyism. It often feels like Big Government is in our wallets, our doctor’s offices, in our homes, bullying businesses of all sizes.
This is not the Colorado Way.
Driving up costs with tariff taxes is not the Colorado Way.
Ripping away critical food and health access is not the Colorado Way.
Tearing families apart with a costly and cruel immigration agenda is not the Colorado Way.
Today, nearly 75% of people held in immigration detention centers have no criminal history. In America in 2026, a culture of fear and chaos means families debate going to work or sending their kids to school out of fear they won’t come home. The words on the Statue of Liberty beckoning those who come to “breathe free” ring hollow against the cruel realities we are facing today.
This is not who we are. Since day one, I’ve worked to build a Colorado for All.
It’s a mission that reflects our shared commitment to a compassionate, kind Colorado for everyone, and one that I hope and trust will continue well beyond my administration.
In the words of Aurora Smoky Hill High School graduate Bowen Yang, “the only way forward is to be joyous and to celebrate each other.”
At a time when Washington is peddling the illusion that America somehow isn’t for everyone – that somehow there’s only room for some – some people, some beliefs, some love, some prayer – I want to make it clear:
In our Colorado for All, there is room – and opportunity – for all of us.
In our Colorado for All, we welcome immigrants and refugees who seek to build a better life here, who strengthen our economy and enrich our communities under the shelter of our democracy.
In our Colorado for All, an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us.








In our Colorado for All, we safeguard our fundamental freedoms, protecting the right to be who you are, marry who you love, and choose when or if to start a family.
There is space in our great big hexahectaenneacontakaiheptagonal state for all of us. We are a state of adventure seekers chasing mountain peaks and fresh powder, of wide-eyed entrepreneurs, artists, devout Coloradans of faith, poets, vegans, soccer moms and ultimate frisbee dads, hunters and union workers, farmers and ranchers, and yes, immigrants and refugees.
We respect our differences, and we are stronger and better off because of our rich diversity. In our Colorado for All, hope and kindness are part of our DNA.
The legacy of Jane Goodall, who had a special place in her heart for Colorado, lives on, as we take inspiration from her words, “hope does not deny evil, but is a response to it.”
Hateful and divisive rhetoric rarely stops at just words. We are seeing online vitriol spill over into horrific violence, including right here on our doorstep.
Enough is enough.
We refuse to sit idly by as a culture of targeting our fellow human beings festers in this country that we love.
In words and actions, we must reject the politics of division and the poison of blind hatred by doubling down on respect, kindness, compassion, and truly learn to disagree better.
These are the values that also guide our solidarity with those around the world fighting for freedom as we speak, in Iran and Venezuela, and in solidarity with the brave Ukrainian people in their continued fight against Russian aggression.
In my first State of the State address, I shared a story of a conversation Marlon and I had with our kids. Our then-6 year-old wanted to know the difference between the various political parties. And at the end, he went over to his four year old sister and asked, “What political party are you in?” And without missing a beat, she answered, “the Happy Birthday Party.”
Colorado’s kids are wise in ways that we could all use a little more of.
This year, we will celebrate our state’s 150th birthday, and our country’s 250th. Let’s come together and honor these historic milestones, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as the Happy Birthday Party.
Housing
And we head into our special birthday tackling our shared challenges. Coloradans – of all political stripes, in every part of our state – tell us that the high cost of housing makes it harder to live in the Colorado we love.
In “Field of Dreams,” starring Colorado Rancher Kevin Costner, the wind whispers, “if you build it, he will come.” Or, as we say, if you build it, opportunity will come.








For too long, we’ve run up against roadblocks – from outdated laws to piles of paperwork – that slow or stop new housing, new transit, and new clean energy from even being built.
It reminds me of the words of Taylor Swift and, maybe Kevin Bommer too – “I’ll sue you if you step on my lawn.”
Not us – we say, let us build!
We’ve empowered Coloradans with the freedom to build an ADU on their property, and let homeowners – not the government – make decisions about how much parking is needed, thanks to the bipartisan work of Senators Amabile, Hinrichsen, Exum, Mullica, and Representative Weinberg.
The benefits are even greater than we could have imagined, just ask Speaker Pro Tem Boesenecker whose mother-in-law now lives in an ADU in his own backyard!
We’ve unlocked more housing near transit, opened the door to single – or smart – stair homes, and broken down barriers to lower-cost modular housing, tackled by Speaker Pro Tem Boesenecker, and Woodrow, alongside Senators Ball and Bridges.
And at long last, we tackled construction defects liability to build more condos, unlocking the promise of homeownership for more Coloradans thanks to the work of President Coleman and Senator Roberts.
We put our skin in the game: speeding up contracting times through the Department of Local Affairs, with the department now turning around contracts for new housing in 33 days, down from 61 days a year before. Under Maria De Cambra’s leadership in partnership with the Housing Consortium, we launched the innovative housing hub to make it easier to apply for affordable rental housing tax credits.
We stood up the Educator First Housing initiative to help 3,000 teachers buy their first home thanks to the work of Senators Amabile and Frizell and Representative Lukens.
Through Proposition 123, we’ve built over 10,000 new homes across the state, including in rural communities who are building state-supported affordable housing for the first time.
And there’s more to be done.
As Colorado-born Ji-Young Yoo, the voice of the iconic Zoey in KPop Demon Hunters says, “I do have one idea… Actually, 57, but let’s start with my favorite.” I share Zoey’s enthusiasm when I think of the 57 – or maybe even more – ways we can unlock more housing at lower cost.
This year, we want to ensure local governments have the resources they need to build and improve bus and train stations, and to pair these investments with more housing near transit. I want to thank Speaker McCluskie, Representative Woodrow, and Senators Roberts and Exum for taking this on.
The Housing Opportunities Made Easier, or HOME Act, will open the door to more housing by partnering with higher education, nonprofits, transit agencies, school districts, and housing authorities to build on underutilized land. With Speaker Pro Tem Boesenecker, Representative Mabrey and Senators Exum and Gonzales leading the way, these steps are expected to significantly cut down on building times for new housing.








Coloradans are eager to be a part of the housing solution. For example, in Edwards, the Eagle County School District opened up Miller Flats Apartments with 37 homes for district employees conveniently located near schools, parks, and transit.
We’ve given homeowners the freedom to do more with their property. It’s only the start. By making it easier to subdivide and sell your property, we can boost the supply of affordable starter homes and help Coloradans to stay in their homes.
Together, we’ve worked hard to make the senior homestead exemption flexible and portable, help seniors downsize and free up homes for young families. We can and must make good on our promise to seniors by funding the senior homestead exemption this year.
Doing so will require finding $200 million dollars in one time funding this year. Converting Pinnacol is the way to shore up our workers compensation system to better protect workers, ensure Pinnacol can compete and thrive in today and tomorrow’s marketplace, provide some relief with the budget shortfall, and make good on our bipartisan promise to seniors.
Once you have a home you can afford, keeping up with the costs that come with it is the next challenge. That starts with homeowners insurance which costs too much.
This year we must bring homeowners insurance rates down. Costs continue to skyrocket, up 91% or an average of $2,000 since 2019, and Coloradans in wildfire prone areas are having a harder time even finding insurance.
There are tools at our fingertips that can help bring down homeowners insurance rates.
While we might not tackle the entire challenge overnight, it’s long past time we start, with steps like making hail resistant roofs more affordable, and reducing fire risks, we can drive down claims and lower premiums. Thank you Speaker McCluskie, Representative Brown, Senators Amabile and Snyder, for taking on this urgent issue.
The more we do here to bring down costs, the more opportunity opens up for Coloradans in the ways that matter most – where we live, and how we spend our time and money.
Transit
Five months into my time as Governor, an 8.5 million pound boulder fell smack dab in the middle of Highway 145 just outside of Dolores, Colorado, leaving an eight foot trench in the middle of the road.
When I learned that it would cost the state $200,000 more to get rid of the rock than to reroute the highway I found another way.
I’m a rock tumbling enthusiast, much to Marlon’s chagrin – for those who aren’t familiar, check it out! But there was no way to tumble this particular rock. And so, heeding the wise words of the Beatles, we “let it be.”
This is the same common-sense I’ve used to make it easier, safer, and more affordable to get around our state, whether you choose to do so by car, bike, foot, bus, or train.








Today, getting around takes up too much of Coloradans’ budgets and time, and puts out too much pollution. We’re showing that there’s a better way forward for Coloradans, one with more choices and greater convenience.
We’ve re-paved 2,500 miles of roads in the past five years alone. Under the leadership of CDOT director Shoshana Lew, we’ve tackled long-neglected projects including Floyd Hill, to finally get drivers over Floyd Hill safely and quickly, taking away the scary drive that too many of us can relate to going to or from our incredible Rocky Mountains.
When I took office in 2019, there were 18,000 electric vehicles driving around Colorado, our energy office director Will Toor was one of those early adopters! Today, Will no longer feels lonely, with more than 204,000 electric cars on Colorado’s roads. We’re #1 nationally for percentage of electric vehicle sales, and by embracing these clean, quiet, fun to drive cars, we’ve cut emissions by nearly 600,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year.
Folks: we got all of this done because of policy.
Working with Senator Weissman, we want to make it even more affordable to get an electric vehicle by directing savings to lower-cost electric vehicles.
The lion’s share of additional transportation funding we’ve secured has gone to roads and bridges. But we know we can’t just build our way out of the congestion that is robbing too many Coloradans of our free time and money.
That is why we’ve also supercharged state support for transit.
We are blazing a trail on cost-efficient passenger rail, and we’re doing it in record time. With a new lease and access agreement to begin Mountain Passenger Rail service through the Moffat Tunnel, we are turning the promise of daily, year-round service from Denver to Craig into a reality with the first routes from Denver to Granby kicking off about a year from now.
Looking to the Front Range, we are on the precipice of delivering a joint service partnership from Denver to Fort Collins, working closely with CDOT, RTD, and local governments to get Front Range Passenger Rail across the finish line.
I want to thank Lisa Kaufmann for her amazing work on passenger rail, and before that she thought being Chief of Staff was a hard job!
The success of Bustang, Snowstang, Pegasus, and Outrider show that Coloradans have a big appetite for reliable, affordable bus transit options. In the past five years alone, Bustang ridership has increased fivefold to reach nearly 2.3 million riders to date.
Bustang now runs 20 routes, with lower fares and exciting partnerships with iconic Colorado events, like the X Games. And we are pursuing long- term sustainable funding so Bustang can continue to grow, providing even better service to even more Coloradans now and in the future.
We’ve made major progress. But the reality is, until we have a world-class metro area transit agency with RTD, we simply cannot meet our climate or affordability goals. This begins with governance changes, increased accountability and transparency, and a stronger partnership between the cities it serves and the transit agency. I want to thank Senators Ball and Jodeh,








Representative Froelich, and the late Senator Winter along with Maria Garcia Berry and the accountability committee for putting together a thoughtful and effective approach for how we can realize a world-class transit agency.
Now, letting our Broncos leave Denver would have been like getting an invite to Taylor Swift’s ‘s wedding and saying no – Which is to say, not an option, And by the way, Taylor – I’m an excellent officiant, just ask Allie Kimmel.
In all seriousness, the revitalization of Burnham Yard, one of our state’s most historic properties, lays the groundwork for an amazing hub with multimodal transit, shops, restaurants, and entertainment, and of course, the A-F-C-West Champion Denver Broncos. We look forward to beating the Bills this Saturday, and – hopefully – hosting a Super Bowl parade in February.
We are looking at every piece of the puzzle to make it safer and more affordable to get where you need to go. Today, high auto insurance rates – the 5th highest nationally – lead to far too many uninsured drivers, making our roads less safe for all and further driving up rates.
That’s why I launched the Roadmap to Reduce Auto Insurance Premiums, an action plan to improve road safety and lower auto insurance costs.
And by more than doubling the number of wildlife crossings statewide to more than 70, including the world’s largest in Greenland – no, not that Greenland, Greenland, Colorado, leave the other Greenland alone! – we’re reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions by 90%.
We’re putting the days of too much time spent in traffic, too much money to get around, and too much pollution in the rearview mirror, pushing past the way it is to achieve the way it can be.
Education
Twenty-six years ago, I was driving around the state in an old school bus campaigning for the State Board of Education, demanding more investment in Colorado schools to ensure every student could get a high quality education and thrive.
My passion for education is what drew me into public service after starting my career as an entrepreneur, and is what continues to drive my work as Governor.
There are so many ways we can build a bright future for Colorado and almost all of them begin with education. Education is about opportunity and hope.
Colorado students today get a strong start with free preschool and free full day kindergarten, thanks to Representative Sirota and Senator Bridges.
Students head into fully funded schools thanks to our work with the JBC. Indicators of class size are down by one student today from when I first took office – and average teacher pay is up over $13,000 dollars per year.
If you visit a Colorado classroom today, as I did this week in Colorado Springs, you might notice something special about Colorado’s first and third graders. These classes include the first group of Colorado students to go to free preschool and free full day kindergarten.
I’ve met a lot of them in our schools and usually their first question is ‘who are YOU?!,’ sometimes followed by, “I want to be governor when I grow up!”








When I started out as Governor, going to kindergarten for a full day of school, and going to preschool at all was treated like a bonus, not a necessity.
But the data speaks so clearly otherwise.
High-quality early education prevents achievement gaps, and helps with reading, math, and long term success in school, all while saving families $6,300 a year on preschool and $500 a month on full day kindergarten.
Colorado families eagerly raised their hands to sign up for preschool and kindergarten, catapulting Colorado from 27th nationally for preschool enrollment to third under the leadership of Dr. Lisa Roy.
And today, 98% of kindergarteners take advantage of free-full day kindergarten.
We’ve dedicated historic funding to Colorado classrooms, increasing funding per student from just over $8,000 in 2019 to nearly $12,000 today, and finally with the leadership of Speaker McCluskie, Assistant Minority Leader Bacon, and the Joint Budget Committee, tackled the beast – the Budget Stabilization Factor that for more than a decade hamstrung our schools with too little funding.
At the same time, we’ve worked to protect school funding and the services Coloradans rely on from a rainy day or recession. When I took office, the state’s budget reserves were at 7.25% and today, we’re in the double digits with 13% in the bank.
While our reserves took a minor dip after President Trump and Congress torched our budget last year, we’re on track to get our reserves back up to 15% in the coming years.
In Colorado, we’re doing our part to help our talented, hardworking educators do what they do best: shaping the next generation of learners and leaders.
Each of us can remember a teacher, or likely several, who helped us become who we are today. I want to thank all of the teachers here today, and across Colorado, for your incredible contributions to our state now and into the future.
Workforce
A good education gives students a head start right out of the box, and high-quality skills and workforce development help Coloradans cross home plate to a good job.
Last year, Colorado high school students enrolled in a record 146,000 courses through our Community College System, earning college credit before graduating and saving over $71 million in tuition costs.
Today we are joined by Mariah, a Nursing student at CSU Pueblo. Thanks to concurrent enrollment opportunities, Mariah earned two credentials and completed the first three years of her Bachelor’s, while still in high school at Swallows Charter Academy in Pueblo. And today, Mariah is working in an ICU in Colorado Springs while completing her studies. Welcome, Mariah!








Through the bipartisan National Governors Association, my Chair Initiative: Let’s Get Ready: Educating All Americans for Success, kickstarted a long-overdue national conversation about how we better connect the skills students get in school with those that lead to a good job.
Now, we are putting the lessons learned from Let’s Get Ready into practice. Alongside six other states, led by both Democratic and Republican governors, we are tracking student readiness in real-time with a new dashboard to more accurately and quickly evaluate if students are ready for and successful at what comes next.
We’re saving Coloradans money with free and low-cost training opportunities, and making the first two years of college free for many Coloradans, thanks to the bipartisan work of Speaker McCluskie, Representatives Taggart, Senators Kirkmeyer and Mullica.
As one of the largest employers in the state, we’re leading by example by hiring for the right skills instead of the right degree, putting an end to the days where good candidates were turned away just because they don’t have a college degree.
Our workforce investments are bold, innovative, and nation leading. And while there’s a lot to be proud of, it’s not enough.
People change jobs more frequently nowadays.
And yet, our job training system is not working for every Coloradan. It’s a maze of more than 20 divisions, offices, and units across seven state departments. The 110 programs available have different eligibility requirements, applications, and outcome measures. I will now read the names of all 110 workforce programs. There will be a quiz at the end.
But seriously, if even I can’t name them all, how can we expect everyday Coloradans trying to get ahead to figure out how to navigate this maze?
Transformative results require bold action. That is why we are calling for a unified department to serve as a one-stop-shop for Coloradans to access high-quality skills, training, apprenticeships, and education. This bipartisan effort led by Speaker McCluskie, Representative Taggart, and Senators Bridges and Frizell is truly poised to unlock opportunity and prosperity for all Coloradans.
Helping Coloradans get job-ready is another way we are making Colorado the best place to work and do business. Today, we are proudly home to a robust business-friendly ecosystem, ranked the top state for female entrepreneurs three years in a row, and fourth best business environment overall by US News and World Report. With Eve Lieberman at the helm of our Office of Economic Development and International Trade, companies continue to thrive in Colorado. Businesses like Boom Supersonic, a $1.5 billion dollar company that started in a Denver basement and is now building a supersonic passenger jet that could get from Denver to London in just over five hours.
My own career is one that in its earliest days was shaped by the promise of emerging technology – at the time, internet 1.0 – when I launched an internet service provider from my college dorm room. This experience taught me a lot about how technology is a tool that can and must be used to maximize opportunity and innovation.








Along those same lines, AI has tremendous potential – but I assure you, did not write this speech! We must act thoughtfully to embrace innovation while empowering consumers.
Today, we are called upon to ensure Colorado remains a leading state for artificial intelligence for both businesses and consumers. Now is the time to get this done in a way that drives innovation and protects Coloradans.
In my time as Governor, one of the greatest honors has been serving alongside the talented men and women who work for state government. We are so fortunate to have such passionate, dedicated Coloradans working across the state, taking on the most difficult challenges we face, and bringing creativity and a commitment to service to their work every single day.
Today, I am honored to be joined by Fidela Jacquez, one of our longest serving state employees whose nearly 50 years in service to Coloradans across the Departments of Public Safety, Transportation, and Revenue, and mentorship of her fellow state employees, has and will continue to make a huge impact on our state now and into the future.
Our efforts to support Colorado’s hardworking and dedicated state employees is further strengthened by our work with Colorado WINS, led by Hilary Glasgow. Thank you Hilary and your team, including President Diane Byrne here with us today, for your passionate advocacy on behalf of our workforce, and for our partnership throughout my governorship.
Health care
Since day one, I’ve taken on special interests and tackled challenges that critics said could never be solved.
When it comes to health care, I would measure our accomplishments against any state in the nation.
Under the leadership of Lieutenant Governor Dianne Primavera and our Office of Saving People Money on Health Care, we’ve tallied nearly three billion dollars in savings for Coloradans even as national costs went up tens of billions of dollars more.
We partnered with bipartisan legislators including Patrick Neville and Pueblo’s own Daneya Esgar on our nation-leading hospital price transparency law. We passed the landmark Colorado Option and bipartisan reinsurance alongside Speaker McCluskie, Senators Jodeh, Rich, and Roberts. We brought Republicans and Democrats together to put an end to surprise billing. We’ve made six behavioral health care sessions free for Coloradans under 18 with Senator Michaelson Jenet. Thanks to the efforts of Senators Gonzales and Weissman, Representatives Froelich and Zokaie, we built in needed protections to assure Coloradans that if they are in need of emergency care and their doctor recommends an abortion to save their life, they will not be turned away.
With the leadership of Division of Insurance Commissioner Mike Conway, we created a first-in-the-nation group that is finally capping the cost of the most expensive drugs and we know we’re on the right track, because we’ve already been sued twice by big pharma. Years before the federal government, alongside Senator Roberts we capped the price of insulin.
Despite all this – and more – we’re not where we need to be.








High-powered and well-funded corporate interests have proven to be deeply entrenched in our politics. It’s like the Avengers fighting Thanos. We are up against big hospitals, pharma, and insurance, alongside a federal government often eager to cozy up to these special interests.
Colorado’s application to import lower-cost prescription drugs from Canada – thanks to the leadership of Kim Bimestefer and Senator Rodriguez – languishes in Washington, first under President Biden and now under President Trump and RFK Jr.
The reality is, the incentives are simply FUBAR. Americans are getting screwed on health care.
Today, hospitals rake in billions of dollars in profits, and actually get away with charging $5,000 for an ice pack, $600 for a bandaid, while insurance companies and pharma raise prices on consumers. I was perhaps a bit naive to think I’d be able to pull together a coalition to fight back against such absurd charges.
Too often, we fight over incremental progress, and when we stand up for systemic change, we are met with the might of the medical industrial complex and their highly effective scare tactics. I saw this firsthand when I was in Congress working to pass the Affordable Care Act, and I’ve seen it time and time again as Governor.
It’s truly mind-boggling that every other industrialized Western country in the world has figured out a way to provide universal health care at a baseline for everyone. Japan spends less than half of what America spends on health care, and their average lifespan is six years longer.
Let me be clear. Our dedicated doctors, nurses, and providers work around the clock to give Coloradans great care. Our essential safety-net hospitals – especially in rural communities – are filling the gap while fighting tooth and nail to keep their doors open, made all the more difficult with the federal government taking a sledgehammer to Medicaid.
Fixing the broken cycle is not about spending more. We’re already doing that and it ain’t working.
The federal government today makes up about half of health care payers through Medicare and Medicaid – it’s long past time the feds start negotiating with prescription drug companies and hospitals and actually drive down costs.
Instead, premiums are skyrocketing across the country after Congress failed to extend the tax credits that millions of Americans rely on to keep health care affordable. In some ways, it’s one of those $600 bandaids, but has at least prevented major increases in insurance premiums.
In Colorado, we’re doing the best with what we have by maximizing efficiency and refusing to let Medicaid, the payer we do have, fail.
The reality is that health care expenses are rising far faster than the rest of our budget. We must take action to bring Medicaid costs to a more sustainable level and protect access for the 1.2 million Coloradans who rely on Medicaid.
The numbers are stark – I almost brought my charts, but I’ll spare you. Ask a JBC member, we can’t afford to keep growing Medicaid at its current pace while still funding schools, roads, and public safety.








So let’s focus on spending less, covering more people, and getting better health outcomes.
As Babe Ruth famously said, “never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game.” Let me be clear. We’ve been in the game and we’re giving it our all.
But when it comes to health care, special interests like big hospitals, big pharma, big insurance and Pharmacy Benefit Managers, are the umpires and have way too much influence to call the pitches the way they like.
We will continue fighting for Coloradans, but ultimately, we need Washington to step up and take real action on a real solution. Call it what you will – a social insurance model, multi-payer universal health care, Medicare for All, a single payer system with private insurance and care on top – no matter the jargon, the outcome is what matters: health care for everyone at lower costs.
It’s long past time Washington got on the side of hardworking Americans, and out of the pockets of special interests.
Public safety
Just like our health, our safety is also critical to being able to lead a good life.
When I set the bold goal to make Colorado one of the ten safest states in the nation, we got right to work taking data-driven, common-sense steps to prevent crime in the first place, better equip law enforcement, and crack down on crime.
We’re seeing real progress. A new report from our Division of Criminal Justice shows that In the past year, violent crime is down over 13%. Property crime is down nearly 18%, representing nearly 14,000 fewer crimes. Through targeted investments and increased penalties, we’ve achieved a 61% decrease in auto theft in four years, including a 34% drop in the last year alone. In a single year, we’ve seen a 95% decline in catalytic converter theft in Denver.
Thanks to the support of voters, we are boosting state support for local law enforcement through Proposition 130, which I proudly supported. This year, the first round of $15 million in funding will go to local law enforcement to boost recruitment, retention, and training.
We are endlessly grateful for the service, bravery, and dedication of Colorado’s law enforcement officers, veterans, and service members. I want to thank all those here with us today for serving our state and nation with pride, ensuring our safety and security.
Keeping Coloradans safe includes better preparing for, preventing, and responding to the year-round threat of wildfires. We’ve expanded Colorado’s arsenal of firefighting tools, including state-owned helicopters like the Firehawk and multi-mission aircraft, fire engines, crews, and contracted air tankers, to ensure we can act quickly and decisively whenever and wherever a fire breaks out.
Our National Guard servicemembers have been on the frontlines – on the ground and in the air – in the aftermath of Colorado’s devastating fires and floods. Always at the ready, they flew helicopters to drop water on the Cameron Peak and East Troublesome fires, provided real-time data on fire spread, and helped control traffic out of evacuation zones in the Marshall Fire. These are the missions that matter for our communities. I want to recognize the bravery and commitment to service that exemplify our Colorado National Guard, and show our respect for their commitment to helping Coloradans through our hardest moments.








Looking ahead, there is more work to be done to ensure all Coloradans can thrive in safe communities.
While the Trump administration leaves states in the lurch, cancelling $29 million and threatening $19 million more in safety grants owed to Colorado, we are stepping up to do what we can to fill the gap, refusing to leave our safety to chance.
My balanced budget proposal includes support to monitor and protect Coloradans against rising threats of political violence and extremism, along with support for emergency preparedness, response, and recovery to ensure we are prepared to act quickly if disaster strikes. Once again, this is work that we would normally have federal partnership on, but Washington is threatening exactly this funding.
Keeping Coloradans safe includes protecting the spaces we gather, learn, and pray. Today, over 73 non-profits including synagogues, mosques, and churches have made security upgrades with support from the Nonprofit Security grants. Our students deserve to learn free from fear. Our Office of School Safety has supported 239 projects to boost safety and emergency response at 190 schools and districts across Colorado.
Together, under the leadership of Senator Sullivan and so many others – too many to name here – we’ve taken common-sense steps to reduce gun violence while protecting our second amendment rights. The nation-leading red flag law has been enforced over 478 times to protect Coloradans and our communities. Waiting periods, safe and responsible gun storage requirements, and cracking down on ghost guns, help keep all Coloradans safe. Colorado is proud to support responsible gun ownership, including with expanded background checks and making the theft of any firearm a felony. We are protecting the rights of Coloradans to own the gun of their choice while implementing new training for rapid fire and assault-style weapons through Colorado Parks and Wildlife later this year. By cracking down on gun trafficking and illegal firearm activity, we’ve gotten 183 illegal guns off the streets.
To truly keep Colorado safe, we must urgently address gaps in our system related to those who cannot stand trial but are charged with a crime, and ensure that individuals who pose a danger to themselves or others are not just released onto the streets. My supplemental budget request includes funding for the state to work alongside local governments and the judicial branch to pursue appropriate, secure placements and services, and I am asking the legislature to move quickly to get bipartisan legislation to my desk. Thank you to Speaker McCluskie, Minority Leader Caldwell, Senator Amabile, and Minority Leader Simpson for leading bipartisan action.
Environment, clean air
Delivering real results for Coloradans is as much about our values as it is about making life easier and more affordable.
We are showing that it’s possible to cut pollution, lower costs, and spur innovation, following the demands of the market.
By cutting pollution, we are cleaning up our air in ways we can see and feel, helping to reduce bad air quality days, which are down from 65 days in 2021 to 30 days in 2025. My dad in particular appreciates that.
During my time as Governor, the share of energy Colorado gets from low-cost clean sources has grown by nearly 75%, enough power nearly 3 million homes for a year.








I am excited about bright spots like Holy Cross Energy serving Eagle, Pitkin, Garfield, Mesa, and Gunnison Counties. At its peak last spring, Holy Cross generated 96% of its energy from low-cost clean sources.
Meanwhile, Washington DC, is tipping the scales toward expensive, out-of-date coal production that drives up costs, pollutes our air, and subjects all of us to volatile price swings in natural gas. We saw this after the Texas winter storm which drove up energy bills for many Coloradans by nearly $20 a month for years.
In Colorado, we tackle climate challenges head on, instead of burying our heads in a pile of coal. I would say snow, but sadly snowpack this year is only 62% of average.
We’re charging forward on the plan to 100% clean energy to unlock the lowest cost clean energy for Coloradans. By 2030, more than 70% of Colorado’s electricity will come from wind and solar. But we need emerging technologies like geothermal or carbon capture to get us to 100%.
That is why we are taking action alongside Representatives Willford, Senators Weissman and Amabile to maintain the important goal of 100% clean energy while building in needed flexibility to adapt to the realities of federal headwinds.
Now is the time to double down on investment and innovation to build more of what’s needed to power our homes and businesses, including power lines and power plants.
Local governments play a key role in moving energy and transmission projects along, but there is room to grow to ensure permitting across the state is clear, fast, and consistent.
Long before my time as Governor, the oil and gas wars plagued our state. Colorado’s patchwork regulatory environment had few if any meaningful standards.
At best, Coloradans had to worry if oil and gas would be able to drill in their backyard and literally in their living rooms. For far too many Coloradans, this worry became a reality. Even today, the devastating Enterprise Pipeline gasoline spill still impacts Southern Ute Indian Tribe land, showing us the importance of safety.
In my first year as Governor, we passed the most robust regulatory framework for oil and gas in the country, moving drilling operations further from homes and schools. We drilled down to ensure that energy oversight is held to the highest standards, under the cutting-edge Energy and Carbon Management Commission, further supporting innovation in underground geothermal and carbon capture.
I want to thank ECMC Commissioner Jeff Robbins for being with us since day one, dedicating his passion, vision, and expertise to this incredible generationally-important work.
I also want to thank Erin Martinez who bravely shared her story after her home exploded from an undetected gas leak from drilling operations, tragically killing her husband and brother, and all those who paved the way to a safer future for Colorado.
The apocalyptic warnings that our gold-standard regulations would somehow shut down the oil and gas industry in Colorado have proven to be completely unfounded. Today, we have a thriving, robust industry that is electrifying and getting cleaner while adding more protections for health and safety, and is accountable to Coloradans.








We went on to bring responsible oil and gas companies and the environmental community together, preventing costly, divisive ballot measures and creating a new funding stream that moves our state from 42nd in transit funding to 23rd. This work was led by the late Senator Faith Winter, alongside Speaker McCluskie, Representatives Velasco, Willford, Froelich, Bacon and Senator Cutter.
Time and time again, we’ve worked together to tackle the complex challenges we face and chart a sustainable, affordable path forward for Colorado.
From securing our water future, to protecting our wildlife and conserving our public lands, we are taking these lessons with us to prepare for and build resilience to a hotter, drier climate.
Under the leadership of Dan Gibbs with the Department of Natural Resources, we are implementing the visionary Colorado Water Plan and directing over $127 million in new funding to support local water projects. We are seeing record interest in Water Plan Grants, which so far have supported 530 local projects.
Agriculture is on the front lines of drought, and we are helping the next generation of producers get the tools and training needed to adapt to a changing climate. From Water Plan Grants to the transformative work led by Ag Commissioner Kate Greenberg, who just gave birth to her first child earlier this week, we are helping farmers and ranchers to prepare for and build resilience in the face of a hotter, dryer climate.
Looking to the Colorado River, under the leadership of Commissioner Becky Mitchell, we are working to find consensus while protecting the water for Upper Basin states. There is no state better positioned to lead the way to a sustainable future for our namesake river.
In light of the pine beetle outbreak spreading in the Front Range and foothills, we are stepping up to mitigate the most harmful impacts and protect our communities, forests, and key water sources.
We are also stepping up to support our pollinators, the workhorses of our ecosystems who are responsible for one in three bites of food we eat. Together, we are building on our work to protect pollinators from threats faced from some pesticides, including with bills this year led by Senators Kipp and Wallace.
Our treasured public lands are part of the fabric of who we are in Colorado, full of fun and adventure, home to incredible wildlife, and key to our economy.
Elevating enjoyment and care of our great outdoors go hand in hand. We’ve expanded our state parks and wildlife areas by over 90,000 acres, advanced conservation for 270,000 federal acres like the Thompson Divide, and opened up access to over 1 million acres of state trust lands.
We’ve created more than $120 million in new annual funding for the care and conservation of our public lands, including with the Keep Colorado Wild pass that cut the price of a state parks pass by more than half to $29, and growing lottery funding for Colorado’s outdoors. The first-of-its-kind outdoors strategy sets the vision to best care for our great outdoors while putting every dollar to the best possible use.








The moving words of America the Beautiful have connected generations to Colorado’s “Purple Mountains Majesty,” inspired by the beauty of Pikes Peak, where I was earlier this week, we are ensuring that America’s Mountain remains as central to Colorado’s future as it has been to our nation’s past. Through Colorado Parks and Wildlife’s partnerships with Mayor Yemi, Colorado Springs Utilities, the US Forest Service, Great Outdoors Colorado, county and local leaders in the Outdoor Pikes Peak Initiative, and the Pikes Peak Outdoor Recreation Alliance, we are expanding opportunities – including new campgrounds, new trails, even better facilities maintenance – for Coloradans to enjoy and protect this hallowed place for generations to come.
As we look ahead to our state’s 150th birthday, what better way to honor Colorado’s proud history and build toward a bright future than by elevating the care and conservation of our most iconic wild spaces.
Look ahead
Our state’s milestone year is also a milestone for many of us who are embarking on our last year in this building.
I’ve truly enjoyed working with everyone here in this chamber, and those who came before. I want to recognize all of the legislators whose terms have matched up with mine – the class of 2026.
And I encourage all of you to take this year to lead on issues you know I will agree with you on perhaps more than the next governor, whether it’s school choice, eliminating puppy mills, technology innovation, supporting blockchain and crypto, or reducing the income tax, now’s your chance.
And on issues you know I disagree with you on, let’s work together to find agreement. Much to my staff’s chagrin, this year I demanded a special veto pen, after poor Jeff Bridges couldn’t even get a regular one from David when I vetoed his bill.
Conclusion
In the Lord of the Rings, Sam speaks to Frodo, saying “there’s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo, and it’s worth fighting for.”
Colorado, there’s so much good, and we keep fighting for more.
There’s good we’ve achieved – more homes for every budget, more ways to get around easier without sitting in traffic, and more opportunities for students at every stage – and the good that we know is still possible, what we continue to fight for.
When I ran to serve as your Governor I promised to be bold – heck, I made a lot of promises, that together, we’ve turned into a reality for Colorado.
Free preschool. Free full day kindergarten. More housing. Less pollution. We dream. We dare. We do.
I’ve been called many things – Colorado’s education governor, marijuana governor, tech bro governor, gay governor, socialist, fascist, communist, capitalist, libertarian. I’ll keep putting in the work and let others decide the labels, but at the end of the day, it’s always been about delivering real results that leave our state better than we found it. And it’s also about showing loving kindness for everyone and everything. I leave you with the advice to be kind and love your fellow human.








Through it all, what will always stick with me are the special moments during my time as Governor – visiting all 64 counties, picking and eating a fresh peach in Palisade, warm from the Colorado sun, the breathtaking view from atop the mesa at Fort Lewis College. Attending church on All Saints Day in Otero County trying with limited success to descend into the only active volcano in Colorado in Dotsero on a wire tied to a tree, taking our kids to see Tarantulas crawl near La Junta, picking Pueblo chiles, surprising seniors for lunch at the San Luis Senior Center. White knuckling it on the drive to the top of Pikes Peak.
Fulfilling a life goal by “playing” Red Rocks with Colorado South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker. And, of course, getting married at the Mary Rippon Theater at the University of Colorado Boulder, Marlon’s alma mater.
Speaking at the preschool graduation ceremony for the first class of universal free preschool. Reading to the first class of full-day kindergarteners.
And of course the people. My cabinet, including those who have been here since the beginning, many of whom I’ve already mentioned, along with Joe Barela, Michelle Barnes, Patty Salazar, and Tony Gheradini. Our incredible executive team, Danielle, Kara, Allie, Mark, Conor, Jesse, our entire staff, and their families who have also dedicated so much.
Our spectacular Colorado is matched only by the heart and ingenuity of those who call our great state home.
Seven years ago, I joined you all in delivering my first State of the State address, and shared what an honor it is to be your Governor.
In the time since, forces beyond us have shaped our reality – a once in a century pandemic, widespread inflation, the biggest and most destructive fires in our state’s history, an unpredictable federal landscape, a massive wormhole connecting to the Abyss with an upside down version of Colorado and our only hope is a group of Dungeons & Dragons – playing teens…. Well, maybe not that.
But despite it all, we faced our challenges head on, never losing sight of our values and what makes us who we are. We stared down the abyss, destroyed our metaphorical Vecnas, and delivered big, bold progress for Colorado while rolling a natural 20 on landing Sundance, the All-Star Game, and the quantum accelerator.
In this time of great division, now more than ever we must come together as Coloradans, leading with kindness and respect to move our ONE team, our great state, forward.
The state of our state is strong. Resilient. Loving. Kind. Innovative. Free. And ever bright with the promise of a Colorado for All. So long, and thanks for all the fish.
G-d bless you all, G-d bless Colorado, and G-d bless the United States of America!

(Photo by Reena Rose Sibayan/New Jersey Monitor)A pro-Palestinian activist arrested by immigration officials after participating in anti-Israel protests at Columbia University and then freed by a federal judge in New Jersey may be rearrested after a federal appeals court ruled against him Thursday.
The 2-1 decision from the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals says Mahmoud Khalil must fight the Trump administration’s attempts to deport him in immigration court, not federal district court. The ruling boots Khalil’s case against the administration back to the district court with instructions for the judge to dismiss the case.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security called the ruling “a vindication of the rule of law” and threatened to deport Khalil if he does not voluntarily leave the United States.

“It is a privilege to be granted a visa or green card to live and study in the United States of America. The Trump Administration acted well within its statutory and constitutional authority to detain Khalil, as it does with any alien who advocates for violence, glorifies and supports terrorists, harasses Jews, and damages property. We would encourage him to use the CBP Home app and self-deport now before he is arrested, deported, and never given a chance to return,” said spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin.
Khalil, in a statement from the American Civil Liberties Union, which argued in support of him in court, called the ruling “deeply disappointing.”
“The door may have been opened for potential re-detainment down the line, but it has not closed our commitment to Palestine and to justice and accountability. I will continue to fight, through every legal avenue and with every ounce of determination, until my rights, and the rights of others like me, are fully protected,” he said.
Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the United States who was born in Syria, was arrested March 8, 2025, with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying Khalil’s advocacy meant his continued presence in the United States “would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences.” The Trump administration has also argued that he failed to disclose certain information on his green card application, amounting to fraud.
He was transferred from New York City to New Jersey before landing in a Louisiana detention center for months. Attorneys filed a writ of habeas corpus against the Trump administration — that’s a legal action taken to challenge incarceration — while Khalil was at the Elizabeth Detention Center, which is why parts of his case were fought in New Jersey. 
While fighting for his release in federal court in New Jersey, an immigration judge in Louisiana sided with the Trump administration and said Khalil could be deported. He appealed that ruling to the Board of Immigration Appeals, and that case is still pending. In June, U.S. District Court Judge Michael Farbiarz, overseeing Khalil’s petition for release in New Jersey, ordered him freed, ruling that his detention was likely unconstitutional. The federal government appealed to the 3rd Circuit, leading to Thursday’s ruling in the Trump administration’s favor.

Judges Thomas Hardiman and Stephanos Bibas, writing for the majority, said the federal Immigration and Nationality Act demands that, with some exceptions, people fighting deportation orders must do so in immigration court, not federal district court.
“That scheme ensures that petitioners get just one bite at the apple — not zero or two. But it also means that some petitions, like Khalil’s, will have to wait to seek relief for allegedly unlawful government conduct,” the judges wrote.
The judges added that because the Board of Immigration Appeals has set an expedited schedule for Khalil’s appeal of the immigration judge’s deportation order, he will be able to quickly challenge the decision.
It is rare for the Board of Immigration Appeals to side with non-citizens challenging deportation orders.
Judge Arianna Freeman, writing in a partial dissent, said she believes the district court was the correct place for Khalil to challenge his detention. Freeman warned that once his case is heard solely by an immigration court, the injuries he suffered during detention may get “no review, let alone meaningful review.”
Hardiman was appointed to the 3rd Circuit by the second Bush administration, Bibas by President Donald Trump, and Freeman by Joe Biden.

(Photo by Kevin Hutcheson)An environmental advocacy group that seeks to protect endangered species is suing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to force a decision from the agency on whether to protect an imperiled salamander found only in Appalachia. 
The Center for Biological Diversity in a federal lawsuit filed Thursday alleges the wildlife management agency failed to protect the yellow-spotted woodland salamander by missing a deadline to make a decision on whether the salamander should be protected under the Endangered Species Act.
The center stated in a press release there were only a few hundred of the salamanders remaining, endemic to Appalachian states including Kentucky, West Virginia, Tennessee and Virginia. The lawsuit asks for a judge to force the agency to make a decision on whether listing the salamander under the Endangered Species Act is warranted. 
“These are some of the most imperiled salamanders on the planet and they can’t wait any longer for protections,” said Will Harlan, a senior scientist for the center.  “Without federal action these salamanders will go extinct on our watch.”
The center along with other organizations including Kentucky Heartwood, Kentucky Waterways Alliance and Appalachian Voices petitioned the agency in 2022 to protect the salamanders.
Taylor Pool, a regional spokesperson for the agency, did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the lawsuit Thursday afternoon. 
The lawsuit states yellow-spotted woodland salamanders are found in shale and sandstone “making it particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation from mining because these areas are targeted by mountain top removal mining.” 
The lawsuit also states the salamander is found on 21 isolated rock outcrops in Appalachia and that new surface mining permits were issued near salamander populations in Eastern Kentucky in Harlan and Letcher counties. 
“The salamander has already lost significant portions of its range to mining, and it will continue to face destruction, modification, and curtailment of its range,” the lawsuit states. “Other threats include overutilization, disease, predation, invasive species, pollution, and impacts from climate change. Its vulnerability is compounded by its low dispersal.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/RSyellow-spotted_woodland_salamander_2_Kevin_Hutcheson_FPWC-1024x617.png,,,2026-01-15 15:57:48.888157

State officials also have serious concerns about the district’s financial health. Wilkinson schools’ full financial picture isn’t clear, officials said, because district officials have not submitted a financial audit since the 2023 fiscal year. The district did indicate a $1.7 million deficit in its budget outlook for the 2025-26 school year.
“We don’t have a choice,” state Superintendent Lance Evans said at a state Board of Education meeting Thursday. When a district hits rock bottom, he said, the state has to act.

The school district has been rated F under the state’s accountability system for each of the past two years, state officials said. State accountability data shows that both Wilkinson County Elementary and William Winans Middle School are also failing. Wilkinson County High has a D grade.
Wilkinson County schools have the second-lowest graduation rate in the state. They also have the state’s lowest proficiency rate in math and science as well as the second lowest proficiency rates in English and history, state education officials said. 
The school district has lost about half of its enrollment since 2019, dropping to around 648 students — a number that prompted board Chairman Matt Miller to question whether Wilkinson County schools should be consolidated into another district.
Consolidation is not yet the top question for state officials. The immediate first step, Evans said, is for state officials to do a full audit of the district’s personnel and finances. The state will abolish Wilkinson County’s school board and remove the superintendent. 
The state Board of Education voted on Nov. 14 to take over Okolona schools for financial reasons, marking the district’s second time under state control in 15 years. District officials had notified the agency on Oct. 30 that it could not make its November payroll. 
At a Senate Appropriations Committee meeting on Wednesday, Evans said there is limited funding available to help provide technical assistance for additional school districts taken over by the state: $4.8 million. Since taking over Okolona schools, the agency has already spent $1.5 million. Evans asked lawmakers for additional funding for next fiscal year.
“It doesn’t take long to eat through that,” Evans said of the agency’s emergency fund. “One district that’s in serious trouble can completely wipe that out.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/17124510/3X0A8453.jpg,,,2026-01-15 15:57:48.888157

The film is the byproduct of a partnership between two nonprofits — Yellowstone Forever and the fStop Foundation. Yellowstone Forever is the park’s official nonprofit partner, while fStop is an organization dedicated to using photography to further conservation efforts.
The Yellowstone Cougar Project is a research effort over 35 years old and the film is about the mountain lions and the researchers who track and seek to understand them. Trail cameras and GPS collars have been used to track and document the interactions of the animals. Part of the film highlights the challenges cougars face being a predator in an ecosystem that also includes bears and wolves.
There are currently four screenings set for the film throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. The first is this evening in Big Sky at the Waypoint.
Additional screenings are planned on:

Jan. 22 in Jackson, Wyoming, at the Center for the Arts.
April 9 at The Shane Center in Livingston
April 15 at The Ellen Theatre in Bozeman.

Those screenings are followed by a panel discussion featuring Dan Stahler, senior wildlife biologist at Yellowstone, along with filmmakers and the Yellowstone Cougar Project team. 
“These screenings create an opportunity for the public to connect more deeply with the science, the stories, and the people working to better understand and protect Yellowstone’s wildlife,” Lisa Diekmann, president & CEO of Yellowstone Forever, said in a press release. “We are proud to support Yellowstone’s Cougar Project through our comprehensive fundraising efforts.”

(iStock /Getty Images Plus)The Florida House once again this year is charging ahead with sweeping changes to laws governing lawsuits, notwithstanding in some cases pressure from business groups, and now will send the bills to the Senate to face uncertain futures.
The legislation covers a range of subjects, from limits on money recoveries from lawsuits against government, medical malpractice, and the death of fetuses.
“It seems like the House leadership is hellbent on bringing more lawsuits in Florida, which will only serve to drive up costs for ordinary Floridians,” Florida Justice Reform Institute President William Large told the Florida Phoenix Thursday. 
The institute focuses on lawsuit-related legislation. “Gov. DeSantis’s reforms from 2023 show tort reform is working. There is no reason to bring all this litigation-fueled legislation,” Large said.
Fetal personhood
Florida law allows would-be parents to recover for “negligent stillbirth” under common law. Those damages are limited to mental pain and anguish plus medical expenses incurred incidental to the pregnancy.
In a partisan vote Thursday, members of the House voted, 76-34, to pass CS/HB 289, a bill that would allow would-be parents to pursue wrongful death claims for the loss of developing fetuses. Wrongful death suits allow plaintiffs to seek damages for mental pain and loss of support, meaning jurors could calculate the salary the fetus might have earned over its life, as part of the monetary damages. Common law refers to a body of law developed through judicial decisions and precedents, not by statute.
Democrats offered nine amendments meant to blunt the reach of the measure, including one by Orlando Democrat Rep. Ana Eskamani that would have given a carve-out for abortion providers. (The Republican-dominated House voted down each attempt.)
“It’s really important to remember that this legislation is expanding Florida’s Wrongful Death Act to apply to fertilized eggs. There’s no way that does not impact abortion access,” Eskamani said. State law protects abortion access through six weeks’ gestation, although not after that.
Eskamani offered a second amendment that would have exempted mothers from wrongful death lawsuits involving the fertilized egg, embryo, or fetus; or against a health care provider who has not been  convicted of a crime in connection with the health care — including a provider of assisted reproductive  technologies — without the consent of the mother.
Jacksonville Democrat Rep. Angie Nixon offered an amendment that would have prevented lawsuits from being filed against gestational surrogates. Nixon said that, as written the bill would allow a surrogate to be sued by intended parents if she were to miscarry. 
“What type of message are we sending to people who are really looking out for other folks? That’s just wrong. Y’all for real? No family looks the same. And as legislators, we should not be getting in the way of people making physical and financial sacrifices in order to have children. If y’all really are pro life, you definitely vote up on this bill,” she said.
Another amendment, offered by Rep. Robin Bartleman, a Democrat from Weston, would have barred wrongful death lawsuits by a person whose involvement with the pregnancy was by means of rape, incest, or human trafficking.
“Where would be the harm in putting this amendment in?” Bartleman asked, noting that every abortion-related bill the Legislature has passed recognizes pregnancies stemming from those crimes and treats those pregnancies differently.
Rep. Marie Paule Woodson, a Democrat from Hollywood, beseeched members to put their feelings about abortion access aside and to pass Bartleman’s amendment.
“Let’s do what’s right, because I don’t want to have to come back in this chamber and have to go back on this bill for us to realize the pain that we will be causing to those impacted,” Woodson said. “If we don’t pass this amendment, we are giving control to those abusers. That’s exactly what we will be doing. “

Former Democrat turned Republican Rep. Hillary Cassel blasted the notion that CS/HB 289 was abortion-related and instead said it was about justice for mothers.
“This is not about abortion. And too often, when we talk about a pregnant woman, it always goes to the side of the mother that didn’t want the child. But what about the mother who wants one? What about the mother and the family who wanted that baby? That’s what this bill does. Don’t make it anything more,”  said Cassel, of Hollywood.
Sen. Erin Grall, a Republican from Fort Pierce, has filed similar legislation (SB 164) in the Senate. That bill cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee by a one-vote margin and has been referred to two other committees.
 “Free kill”

CS/HB 289 wasn’t the only bill related to wrongful death that the House passed Thursday, with the chamber voting, 88-17, to pass HB 6003
Although damantly opposed by organized medicine, insurance, and business lobbyists, the chamber passed the bill with little-to-no debate.
The bill revamps Florida’s wrongful death laws in two ways: Parents of single, childless, adult children 25 and older could file wrongful death lawsuits arising from alleged medical malpractice; and adult children could pursue claims for single parents who die from medical malpractice. Such cases are not allowed under existing law.
Proponents of HB 6003 say it fixes Florida’s “free kill” law, a name coined to describe the different legal protections in Florida statute based on someone’s age, family, and marital status.
Opponents argue the bill would increase the number of lawsuits and result in higher medical malpractice premiums. They have coined their own name for the proposal: “jackpot justice.” 
Those opponents, including Large, say they would support the measure if it were amended to limit damages that can be recovered for all medical malpractice cases, not just the newly expanded class of litigants in HB 6003.
During debate on a similar bill last year, an amendment to cap medical malpractice settlements failed in the Senate by a one-vote margin.
DeSantis ultimately vetoed the 2025 version of the bill because it didn’t contain the caps.
DeSantis delivers on promise and vetoes ‘free kill’ malpractice bill

During a press conference Thursday, DeSantis defended his veto.
“I  will say, you know, that particular legislation I vetoed, if you talk to people in healthcare, it would have caused us to lose doctors. Like, there’s no question, uh, to root, because basically, those were reforms that had been enacted in response to medical malpractice insurance crisis many years ago, well long before I was governor. And so, you would see an impact on that, no question,” DeSantis said.
Sen. Darryl Rouson, a Democrat from St. Petersburg, filed the Senate companion bill (SB 1700) last week
 Sovereign immunity

A bill that would increase the state’s sovereign immunity limits, taking them from $200,000 per person to $1 million and from $300,000 per occurrence to $3 million, passed the House by a 104-7 vote.
The bill would make clear that political subdivisions could settle cases beyond those limits without having to obtain advance approval in the form of a special legislative act. And it specifically would prohibit insurance policies from conditioning payment of settlements upon the enactment of a claims bill.
In legal terms, sovereign immunity refers to the state’s authority to exempt itself as a legal sovereign from civil lawsuits, although the state does allow negligence claims against itself and its subdivisions — agencies, cities, counties, and public hospitals — within limits. Injured parties can sue for damages and collect within the liability thresholds established by law but, if they win awards in excess of the limits, they must go to the Legislature in the form of what’s called a claims bill to collect the payment.
The claims bill process is lengthy and allows the defendant to challenge a jury verdict. Once a claims bill is filed, each chamber’s presiding officer refers it to a special master, who essentially reconsiders the jury’s recommendation. Claims bills also go before House and Senate committees that consider special masters’ recommendations. Ultimately, the bills must pass in both chambers.
It’s not unusual for claims bills to take years to pass, if ever.
Sen. Jason Brodeur, a Republican from Lake Mary, filed the Senate companion bill, SB 1366. That bill takes the existing sovereign immunity limita in law and increases them to $300,000 per person and $450,000 per incident. The bill directs the Department of Financial Services to adjust the caps five years from now and every five years thereafter, to reflect the Consumer Price Index. However, the bill limits those increases to no more than 3%.
In addition to the difference in the caps, the Senate bill lacks the language in the House bill that allows political subdivisions to settle cases beyond those limits without legislative intervention.
The Senate bill was filed last week and has not yet been referred to any committees.
 Phosphates

The House also passed HB 167, a priority bill for Senate President Ben Albritton and the one tort-related bill that offers increased protections to businesses that the House passed Thursday.
Offered by Rep. Lawrence McClure, R-Dover, and Rep. Richard Gentry, R-Astor, the bill would establish a defense from strict liability if the lawsuit is related to pollution caused by a former phosphate mine and certain requirements are met. 
Phosphate companies have faced lawsuits filed by people who bought homes built on radioactive spoils left by mining.
This strict liability defense applies to lawsuits brought by the Department of Environmental Protection as well as lawsuits brought by any other person.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Legal_Gavel_27571702173-1024x776.jpg,,,2026-01-15 15:57:48.888157

She weighed only 27 pounds, the report said,","An autopsy report released this week in the case of Jacqueline “Mimi” Torres-García, the 11-year-old found dead in a plastic bin late last year in New Britain, confirmed that her death was caused by child abuse and starvation. 
The child had a single blueberry in her stomach at the time of her death, according to the state’s autopsy. The report also stated that she weighed only 27 pounds, had “marked emaciation,” and a “near-absence” of fat on her body. She also had amphetamines, a stimulant that wasn’t prescribed to her, in her system.
Police found Torres-García’s body in a plastic container behind an abandoned house in October. Her mother, her mother’s boyfriend and her aunt have all been charged in relation to her death, which officials have said occurred in 2024.
Karla García, Torres-García mother, has been charged with seven felonies including a murder charge, child abuse, unlawfully restraining her daughter and illegally disposing of a body. García’s boyfriend, Jonatan Nanita, has been charged with the same felonies and larceny for allegedly defrauding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
The child’s aunt, Jackelyn García, has been charged with three felonies related to child abuse and unlawful restraint. All three have hearings scheduled later this month.
The autopsy says witnesses confirmed that Torres-García was restrained with zip ties.
The case has also reinforced calls for more regulation of the state’s homeschooling system. In July 2024, the girl’s mother emailed school officials to alert them she planned to homeschool her daughter. Less than two months later, the child was dead, according to court records.
Documents from the two school districts García, the girl’s mother, emailed regarding her plans to educate her daughter show that the homeschooling plan likely hid abuse from people who would have been required to report it to the state. It’s the second high-profile case in recent months related to homeschooling in Connecticut.
In February, officials found that a Waterbury man had been allegedly locked away for decades after being pulled out of school in the fifth grade. Democrats convened a hearing to discuss the issue last session, which led to thousands of protesters gathering at the Capitol arguing against regulation of homeschooling.
Speaker of the House Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said Wednesday night that there will likely be legislation about Torres-García’s case, which may include homeschooling and the Department of Children and Families. DCF had a history with the family. He said there’s more need to look at situations in which a family has a DCF history and gets withdrawn from school.
“If you’ve had a lot of interaction with DCF and law enforcement and you just suddenly withdraw your kid, we might need to have better follow up on that,” Ritter said, noting the conversation is highly politicized. “That might get really ugly. Republican versus Democrat.”
House Minority Leader Rep. Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, said he would support more oversight of families who withdraw their children from school and have active cases with DCF, but doesn’t want to see the legislation stretch into broad homeschooling regulation.
“The broader conversation about homeschooling and to what degree they should be registered is a much more complicated conversation because it immediately moves into the realm of curriculum review, approval, testing,” Candelora said. “That defeats the whole point of homeschooling. To me, that’s a separate issue, and I don’t want to see us use a tragedy as an opportunity to regulate homeschooling.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jacqueline-22Mimi22-Torres-Garcia-Memorial-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 15:57:48.888157

MONTPELIER — The two candidates vying to be the next leader of the Vermont National Guard both told lawmakers this week they would resign that post rather than carry out an unlawful order from their superiors in the state or federal government.
Vermont’s Legislature elects an adjutant general, which is the top military officer in the state, every two years. The current office-holder, Maj. Gen. Gregory Knight, is stepping down after seven years, creating an open race. The Vermont National Guard includes both the state’s Army National Guard and Air National Guard.
Two current guard members are vying to succeed Knight: Deputy Adjutant General Henry “Hank” Harder, who’s a retired Air National Guard general, as well as Army National Guard Col. Roger “Brent” Zeigler. Gov. Phil Scott is the commander-in-chief of the Guard, while the adjutant general is responsible for managing the force’s 2,700 members and keeping state military records.

This year’s adjutant general election is notable because it comes as members of the Vermont Air National Guard have been deployed under controversial federal orders. According to the office of U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., President Donald Trump’s administration has directed the Air Guard to take part in Operation Southern Spear, the U.S. military campaign that resulted in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. 
Democratic members of Congress, including those in Vermont’s delegation, have condemned the operation, which has more broadly targeted alleged drug smuggling boats and killed dozens of people. Some Democrats and experts in international law have said the U.S. may have committed war crimes by targeting survivors, while a few Republicans in Congress have pledged to investigate the drone strikes.
Harder and Zeigler faced questions from state legislators during a joint hearing of the Vermont House and Senate government operations committees on Tuesday. The full state House and Senate will elect one of the two candidates on Feb. 19. Vermont is the only state in the country where the head of its National Guard is elected, rather than appointed by the governor.
Harder was first to testify during the hearing. In response to a question from Sen. Tanya Vyhovsky, P/D-Chittenden Central, he said he would do everything he could to gather information about whether an order from a superior was legal or not. However, after that fact-gathering, “if it was still clear to me that I had a question whether it was a lawful or legal order, I wouldn’t do it,” Harder said.
“(It’s) not what I would want to do. But, if I was forced into that, I would resign before I would ask my soldiers and airmen to do things like that, or go down that path,” he said.
During his turn testifying, Zeigler faced a similar question from Vyhovsky and said that provided he knew “all of the details to the situation” and had consulted legal counsel, he would also be willing to step down in the face of an illegal order.
“I would agree with Gen. Harder — I would resign,” Zeigler said. He added that he “would not want to be the person” to lead guard members in a state- or federally-ordered response to a city if that response “could violate certain laws, human rights.”No legislators asked specifically for the candidates’ opinions on the legality of the recent military actions in and around Venezuela.
While each state’s National Guard troops typically are commanded by their respective governors, the president has authority to mobilize the guard in specific circumstances. Trump has pushed that power to its judicial breaking point since beginning his second term, including deploying states’ National Guard troops to major U.S. cities.
Gov. Scott, a Republican, has at least twice over the past year chosen not to deputize the state’s National Guard for federal initiatives: first a request to help with clerical immigration enforcement work and later as part of Trump’s efforts to crack down on crime in Washington, D.C. 
Details about the guard’s role in Operation Southern Spear have been scant. In written testimony to legislators on Tuesday, Knight called the force’s recent deployment “an involuntary federal mobilization.” He wrote that he did not know at that point how long the Vermont guard would be deployed.
Harder, in pitching himself to legislators Tuesday, emphasized his role since January 2024 as Deputy Adjutant General, which is the guard’s No. 2 below Knight. He said his priorities would be improving care for veterans in the state and bolstering the guard’s recruitment. Both the army and air units have numerous vacancies, he said.
Zeigler told lawmakers he would focus on empowering guard members to speak about mental health and other issues they are struggling with. He also pointed to his role as president of the Vermont National Guard Charitable Foundation, which provides emergency financial aid to guard members and their families, among other roles.
Knight told lawmakers that he was not endorsing one candidate over the other at this point.

A judge ruled Jan. 14. 2026 that his appointment as “acting” U.S. Attorney for New Mexico was invalid. (Courtesy U.S. Attorney’s Office)A judge ruled this week that Ryan Ellison, the federal prosecutor leading New Mexico’s United States Attorney’s Office, could no longer legally call himself the “acting” United States Attorney, saying Attorney General Pam Bondi acted outside the scope of the law when she designated him as such last August. 
But David Nuffer, a United State district judge in Utah, in a 53-page ruling Wednesday stopped short of declaring invalid all of the actions Ellison has taken since August. A group of defense attorneys argued in court that Ellison’s indictments against some clients had no force of law because the person who made them was acting illegally.
Defense attorneys, including from the Office of the Federal Public Defender, representing clients in 19 criminal cases all filed similar motions last year challenging Ellison’s authority. A spokesperson for the office did not immediately respond to Source New Mexico’s request for comment. 
The lawsuit centers around a sequence of events in mid-August in which Ellison officially resigned as “interim” U.S. Attorney before Bondi named him “first assistant” and then immediately after “acting” U.S. Attorney. Defense attorneys said the maneuver undermined Congressional authority to confirm permanent appointees and laws governing who can and can’t fill vacant federal offices. 
Department of Justice extends New Mexico US attorney’s term amid judicial, Senate criticism

Because President Donald Trump has not officially submitted Ellison for Senate confirmation, Ellison’s official status and title as head of the office have remained precarious for more than a year. He is one of several unconfirmed United States attorneys who have faced legal challenges seeking to remove them from office. 
In Ellison’s case, he was initially appointed as “interim” chief federal prosecutor after Alex Uballez, a Biden-era appointee, stepped down. Bondi named Ellison “acting” U.S. attorney a day after a panel of federal judges declined to approve his “interim” designation. But the “acting” title came with an expiration date at the end of last year, which prompted the defense attorneys’ challenge.
Now, due to Nuffer’s ruling, Ellison’s title is “first assistant” United States Attorney, a title usually given to the prosecutor leading an office in the event of a sudden resignation or death of the confirmed chief prosecutor. 
Gang prosecutor appointed as new U.S. attorney for the District of New Mexico

The authority and responsibilities are effectively the same, according to Nuffer’s ruling, including “the authority to supervise and conduct legal proceedings” and oversee assistant and special prosecutors who work on those proceedings. 
While Nuffer’s ruling doesn’t allow Ellison to continue as “acting” U.S. attorney, the judge  justified upholding Ellison’s previous actions by describing them as tasks that could have been delegated to others in the office and that were within the scope of the office’s duties. 
In an emailed statement Thursday, Ellison called himself “First Assistant U.S. Attorney” per the judge’s ruling. But he said his “mission remains the same” despite the change in title.
“Since I was appointed last April, I’ve repeatedly used the phrase ‘for however long I serve,’ because the duration of my time leading the United States Attorney’s Office has always been uncertain,” he said, before adding that he will “work tirelessly to enhance public safety for all New Mexicans.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image009-1024x827.jpg,,,2026-01-15 15:57:48.888157

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)Outdoor learning for K-12 kids, expanding trade pathways in middle schools, universal pre-k and bilingual education were top of the education platform announced Thursday by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Deb Haaland.
Haaland, a former U.S. congresswoman and U.S. The Secretary of the Interior made the announcement of her platform from a classroom in Albuquerque’s Highlands Highschool, the last of the 13 public schools she attended in childhood, due to constant moves  by her military family.
“Every step in a child’s education should open doors for them, from pre-k to grade school to whatever they decide to do after. Our kids can’t do that alone though, they need stability at home and their educators should feel supported to do the jobs they need to do,” Haaland said.
When asked, Haaland said if elected, she would continue to support free universal child care, a policy announced by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who is term-limited from seeking office again.
Haaland acknowledged that lawmakers and the executive disagree on how to pay for the program but said if she’s sworn in: “I’ll be happy to see where it is and I’ll take it from there.”
Supporters included the New Mexico American Federated Teachers Union leadership, teachers, and the Democratic chairs of both education committees in the Legislature.
Picaris Pueblo Gov. Craig Quanchello praised the plan for “investing in Native schools and children to meet their unique needs,” in a speech endorsing Haaland.
“I’m honored to stand before an amazing person and support her. Education is strongest when it reflects who our children are and the communities that raise them,” he said.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Four Washington school districts are under federal investigation for reportedly allowing transgender girls to compete in girls’ sports, escalating long-simmering tensions between the Trump administration and the state over the issue.
The U.S. Department of Education launched the probes Wednesday into the Tacoma, Vancouver, Cheney and Sultan school districts in response to complaints. Across the country, 14 other districts, colleges and state education departments face similar new investigations.
The Trump administration began at least two inquiries in Washington last year on related issues. One targeting the state’s Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction.
According to the Department of Education, Cheney allegedly allowed a trans girl to compete on the girls’ track team; Sultan let a trans girl on the volleyball team; Tacoma allowed a trans girl into “female intimate spaces” and onto sports teams; and Vancouver allowed a trans girl on the girls’ bowling team. 
The Vancouver district said it is reviewing the allegations, but otherwise declined to comment. A Cheney spokesperson also declined, but said the district plans to cooperate with the federal agency’s probe. Tacoma and Sultan didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Enacted in 1972, Title IX prohibited sex-based discrimination in schools receiving federal funding. The civil rights law increased the participation of female student athletes, and also provided an avenue for girls and women to bring complaints of sex discrimination. 
“Time and again, the Trump Administration has made its position clear: violations of women’s rights, dignity, and fairness are unacceptable,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Kimberly Richey in a statement. “We will leave no stone unturned in these investigations to uphold women’s right to equal access in education programs — a fight that started over half a century ago and is far from finished.”
WA Initiative, U.S. Supreme Court cases
Voters in Washington will likely get to weigh in on the issue this November. 
An initiative from the conservative Let’s Go Washington political committee looks to block transgender girls from competing in girls’ sports. Democratic leaders in the state Legislature said last week they wouldn’t take up the measure, leaving it to voters if state officials confirm the initiative got the required signatures.
A conservative legal firm on Monday demanded the Legislature hold a hearing on the initiative, arguing that declining to do so is unconstitutional. Top Democrats in the Legislature, including House Speaker Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma, were not swayed.
This week, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on state laws in Idaho and West Virginia that ban transgender athletes from playing for women’s and girls’ sports teams. The conservative majority on the court appeared likely to uphold the bans. 
Simmering issue
As with many issues, Washington has been at odds with the Trump administration on the participation of transgender athletes. 
Some school districts have filed complaints with the Department of Education to intervene to force the state to comply with new federal policy on the matter. At the time, they said they were in a difficult position to either follow state law and jeopardize federal funding, or follow President Donald Trump and risk punishment from the state.
The administration has argued athletes assigned male at birth have physical advantages that disadvantage and pose safety risks for female athletes. Despite threats from Trump and an executive order, Washington has stuck with its policy allowing trans athletes to participate.
“Washington state law prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity, and school districts are acting in alignment with state law when they provide trans students with the opportunity to participate in athletics in alignment with their gender identity,” state Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction spokesperson Katy Payne said in an email.
In March, the Department of Education announced it was investigating the Tumwater School District after a 15-year-old girls’ basketball player said she sat out a game “for fear of her safety” because a player from the opponent, Shelton High School, was trans, according to the department. A Tumwater spokesperson said Thursday the district hadn’t heard any updates on the case.

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
The agency also launched an investigation into the state superintendent’s office over gender inclusion policy. The federal government alleged the state policy conflicted with federal law.
In April, the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association voted down two proposals related to trans athletes. The association sets policy for school sports in the state.
One would have barred trans girls from participating in girls’ sports. Another would have created a separate division where trans athletes can compete.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/educationdepartment-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-15 15:57:48.888157

Certain New Hampshire Medicaid recipients will begin having to pay premiums in order to receive coverage from the public health program this year as part of a Republican plan to shore up the state’s finances. State officials say those premiums could bring in tens of millions of dollars.
Lawmakers, when passing the budget in July 2025, instructed DHHS to implement that system by July 2026.
During a state Senate hearing on Tuesday, Medicaid officials reported the premiums could bring the state up to $23 million in the state’s fiscal year 2027 — which lasts from July 1, 2026, to June 31, 2027 — and another $23 million the following fiscal year.
The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to emailed follow-up questions asking whether this figure assumes all enrollees will pay the premium instead of dropping coverage.
The premiums will cost some Medicaid enrollees up to $270 a month. Enrollees who earn 100% of the poverty line or more will pay $60 to $100 per month, depending on the size of their families. Enrollees making at least 255% of the poverty line will be required to pay $190 to $270 monthly. Based on 2025’s federal poverty level standards, here’s what people are set to pay: 

A household of one person earning $15,650 a year — 100% of the poverty level, per 2025’s federal standards — is set to pay $60 a month to keep their coverage under the new system.
A household of two people earning $21,150 is set to pay $80 a month
A family of three earning $26,650 a year is set to pay $90 a month.
A family of four earning $32,150 a year is set to pay $100 a month.
A family of five earning $37,650 a year is set to pay $100 a month.
A household of two people earning $53,932.50 — 255% of the poverty level — a year is set to pay $190 a month.
A family of three earning $67,957.50 is set to pay $230 a month.
A family of four earning $81,982.5 is set to pay $270 a month.
A family of five earning $96,007.5 is set to pay $270 a month.

Olivia May, New Hampshire’s director of Medicaid enterprise management, told senators during the hearing that the state doesn’t yet know what costs it will incur to update its payment systems to be able to handle the new premiums. She said her team is exploring the best way to do that.
“We just don’t have an estimate at this time of system costs,” May said. “I know that wasn’t included in the fiscal note because we don’t have a final view of that yet. We’ve had many conversations with different system leads to try to determine the best path.”
Republicans, who control both chambers of the Legislature, passed the premium plan — as well as several other changes to Medicaid — as part of the state budget last year. Gov. Kelly Ayotte, who included the premiums in her budget proposal, defended the system at the time by pointing out that many states — 22 according to KFF — don’t even offer Medicaid to children whose households earn more than 255% of the federal poverty line.
Democrats opposed the premiums and compared them to an “income tax on the poor.” A group of Democrats, led by Nashua state Sen. Cindy Rosenwald, have filed legislation attempting to repeal the premiums. The Senate Finance Committee is now considering that bill, Senate Bill 484.
On Tuesday, Rosenwald, after hearing the cost estimate from state officials, characterized the premium revenue as “a $23 million cost on low-income families.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/medpremiums-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-15 15:57:48.888157

The federal indictment returned Wednesday does not mean Stephen Spencer Pittman is facing a new charge, only that a grand jury has confirmed federal prosecutors have enough evidence to proceed with prosecuting the 19-year-old for burning the Beth Israel Congregation temple. 
Federal and state prosecutors have not announced how they will collaborate on Pittman’s court cases. His attorney, federal public defender Mike Scott, could not immediately be reached Thursday.  
In state court, Pittman is facing a charge of first-degree arson. Earlier this week, a Hinds County Circuit Court grand jury indicted Pittman on that charge and recommended his sentence be enhanced under a Mississippi law punishing “offenses committed for discriminatory reasons.”
The federal government has not filed hate crime charges against Pittman and it was not immediately clear whether those are being considered. He also has not made an initial appearance in state circuit court, nor has one been scheduled, according to a court administrator.
Pittman is being held in federal custody, though it was not immediately known where. 
This photo provided to Mississippi Today, of a Snapchat account labeled “Spencer,” shows Stephen Spencer Pittman, 19, who has been indicted  on state and federal arson charges in the Jan. 10, 2026, fire that heavily damaged Mississippi’s largest synagogue.
If convicted, Pittman’s federal charges carry a punishment of up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. The federal charges against him were released earlier this week in an affidavit from an FBI agent that alleged Pittman broke into the northeast Jackson synagogue before dawn Saturday, doused a lobby in gasoline and set it on fire. Later that day, he allegedly confessed to law enforcement that he targeted the synagogue for its “Jewish ties.” 
The blaze charred parts of the synagogue, left smoke damage throughout and destroyed two Torahs. The fire was set in the same part of the one-story brick building that Ku Klux Klan members bombed in 1967 because the congregation’s rabbi supported civil rights. 
The Hinds County indictment did not include a photograph of Pittman. Federal authorities also have not released a photo of him.
Pittman is scheduled to return to federal court for a preliminary hearing Tuesday.
Federal investigators quickly identified Pittman – a former high school and community college baseball player –  as a person of interest, according to the affidavit filed earlier this week, which included text messages he allegedly sent to his father in the course of setting the fire Saturday. The father pleaded for his son to return home, the affidavit says, but Pittman “replied back by saying he was due for a homerun and ‘I did my research.’” 
Pittman is alleged to have confessed to his father, who later contacted the FBI and provided GPS data showing Pittman was at the synagogue early Saturday morning. 
The son “laughed as he told his father what he did and said he finally got them,” said the affidavit from Nicholas Amiano, an FBI agent in the Jackson division.

SB 322, sponsored by Sen. Jabo Waggoner, R-Vestavia Hills, passed at a time when Cullman County did not have any representation in the Alabama House due to an early-session resignation and a late-session resignation. 
The law allowed a wet city to annex a “community development district” with a size of at least 250 acres from a dry country to build a development that sells alcohol. 
In 2024, Jeff Tolbert, a Cullman resident and owner of Trident Marina, announced plans to develop a $275 million resort along Smith Lake. According to the Cullman Tribune, Tolbert planned to have the development done by 2027 and employ over 300 people across what was expected to be a resort spanning 2,500 acres.
“Looking at that, it produced jobs, it produced capital investment,” Gudger said on the Senate floor. “I love economic development. I thought this was a good bill last year.”
Objections to the law were major points for then Republican and Democratic candidates, with critics saying a large development could change the character of the area. The law went into effect on Oct. 1, but the city of Cullman never moved to annex the land amid the controversy.

Members of the Michigan House Government Operations Committee on Thursday heard testimony from small farmers in support of a trio of bills put forth by state Rep. Matt Maddock (R-Milford), allowing farmers to sell raw milk directly to consumers, while setting product and labeling standards, alongside waiver requirements for individuals choosing to purchase the milk.
Under the current law, Michigan farmers are barred from selling unpasteurized milk. However, residents can acquire raw milk by participating in a herdshare program, where members can pay a farmer a fee for an animal’s board or for a share of the animal, which entitles them to a share of the animal’s whole, unprocessed milk.

While the Centers for Disease Control, the U.S. Food and  Drug Administration and experts at institutions like the American Academy of Pediatricians and Harvard Medical School all advise against consuming raw milk, Ashley Armstrong, who started Armstrong Farms in southwest Michigan, argued that adults in the U.S. are already allowed to make informed decisions involving health risks every day. 
“Alcohol, vape pens, sushi with raw fish, raw oysters and even raw cookie dough,” Armstrong said. “In those cases, the government doesn’t ban access. Instead, it provides information and allows adults to decide for themselves. So why shouldn’t adults be allowed to purchase farm fresh foods they believe are healthier for them, while fully understanding and accepting the risks?”
While multiple studies have found no evidence that raw milk is more nutritious than pasteurized milk, bill supporters argued that raw milk contains beneficial compounds for supporting gut health. 
According to the FDA, there are no beneficial bacteria in raw milk to support gastrointestinal health, and that Bifidobacteria, which some raw milk advocates have referred to as “good bugs” in the milk, are a sign of fecal contamination, as these bacteria are commonly found in the digestive tracts of humans and animals.
The FDA also notes that raw milk does not cure lactose intolerance, despite arguments to the contrary. All milk, pasteurized or otherwise, contains lactose and proteins that can cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals, and raw milk does not contain any additional substances to aid in milk digestion.
Rick Hitchcock, who runs a family farm in Fowlerville, argued that proper animal hygiene and sanitation practices can ensure safety in raw milk. However, state Rep. John Fitzgerald (D-Wyoming) remained skeptical, noting that even very clean animals can still introduce bacteria like E.coli and listeria into the product.
Later in the hearing, Fitzegerald pointed to a study shared by the CDC which found raw milk was linked to 202 outbreaks of foodborne illness and 2,645 illnesses between 1998 and 2018. This includes 228 instances of hospitalization and three deaths.

Armstrong countered, arguing that raw milk only accounted for a small number of the 21,919 foodborne outbreaks reported during this period. However, consumers of raw milk are also in the vast minority of Americans, with a 2022 study published in the Journal of Food Protection finding 4.4% of U.S. adults reported drinking raw milk at least once in a 12 month period.
Another study, published in 2017, found that unpasteurized milk and cheese accounted for 96% of illnesses caused by contaminated dairy products.
Maddock’s House Bills 5217, 5218 and 5219 received 133 cards in support, with Maddock telling committee Chair Brian BeGole (R-Perry) he had 231 individuals supporting the legislation. However, members of the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, Dairy Farmers of America, Michigan Agri-Business Association, Michigan Dairy Foods Association, Michigan Milk Producers Association and Michigan Manufacturers Association submitted cards in opposition to the bills, but did not speak at Thursday’s hearing. 
In a letter to the committee, Rebecca Park, legislative counsel for the Michigan Farm Bureau, urged members to oppose the bill, emphasizing the critical role that pasteurization plays in preventing illness and warning that any raw milk related outbreaks would create concerns about Michigan’s broader dairy industry. 
“Maintaining the current statutory framework is essential to protecting public health, preserving consumer trust, and supporting the long-term stability of Michigan agriculture,” Park said.
Maddock, however, was unfazed by the broad opposition from business groups and state regulators.
“The corporations don’t want this, but all people do,” Maddock said as the committee concluded without voting on the bills.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1297005217-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-15 14:57:28.918251

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma Voice and its parent organization have sued the state Department of Transportation to obtain unredacted and complete copies of the agency’s flight logs.
The open records lawsuit, filed by States Newsroom doing business as Oklahoma Voice, alleges the agency unlawfully redacted the lists of passengers who flew on the state plane, which is maintained by the Oklahoma Department of Transportation, and also failed on dozens of occasions to disclose the purpose of the flights as required by state law.
A spokesperson for the Oklahoma Department of Transportation declined to comment as the state agency had not yet been served the lawsuit. 
Oklahoma Voice in July requested that the agency provide a copy of travel logs for all individuals who used the Transportation Department’s plane, including the “date, time, passenger list, duration and purpose of the trip along with the total cost.” 
ODOT provided the records, but redacted some passenger names for flights involving the Governor’s Office. In addition, the purpose of over 50 flights was left blank or contained a statement that it was “not provided.”
Of the different agencies that used the plane, only the Governor’s Office and Department of Public Safety left the purpose blank, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges that the purpose for those flights was omitted because both agencies did not provide ODOT with the information.
The lawsuit also alleges some flight purpose information provided by other agencies was inadequate. Four trips identified the reason for the trip as “visits” or “airport visits” while 13 only listed “meeting” or “event,” according to the lawsuit.
Leslie Briggs, an attorney with Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, who is representing Oklahoma Voice, wrote in the lawsuit that ODOT’s attorney responded that while the agency maintained the records, “it can not provide information that has not been received. If the purpose is not included, ODOT does not fill in the blanks.” 
The agency’s attorney also cited a provision of the Oklahoma Open Records Act that allows the Department of Public Safety to keep confidential records related to personal information along with other information that could be considered of a tactical nature, according to the lawsuit.
ODOT said in November that it had unredacted copies of the records, but would not release them, according to the lawsuit. 
The Governor’s Office previously said passenger logs on prior flights were redacted if they contained Department of Public Safety employees or the names of Gov. Kevin Stitt’s children.
The lawsuit contends that state law requires the printed name of each person traveling on an aircraft and the purpose of each landing, “including whether the purpose of a landing is for a speech, meeting or performance of a service.” 
State law requires that those travel logs be maintained and made available to the public upon request under the Open Records Act.
Among other things, the lawsuit, which was filed in Oklahoma County District Court, requests that Oklahoma Voice be provided unredacted copies of the records, and that the Department of Transportation be required by the court to properly maintain complete records as required by law. It also seeks “reasonable” costs and attorneys fees.
Briggs said this lawsuit aims to ensure “maximum transparency allowed by law.”
“The goal of this lawsuit is to clarify what information may be redacted under the (Open Records Act) and what information must be gathered as required by statute in order to maintain complete records of expenditures of public funds relating to the use of the state plane,” she said in a statement. “Taxpayers deserve to know for what purpose their money is spent when public officials use the state plane.”

Sean Cleary, R-Bismarck, asks a question during a Dec. 10, 2026, legislative committee meeting. (Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)Two state lawmakers have raised concerns to the State Investment Board that the $1.3 million in bonuses slated to go to the Retirement and Investment Office employees may be a violation of state law.
Sen. Sean Cleary, R-Bismarck, in a Tuesday letter to board members said that the bonuses are required by law to be based on the performance of investment money the state manages internally. Cleary said that instead, it appears that bonuses for 2025 were calculated based on the performance of funds mostly managed by outside firms.
The board will consider approving the bonuses to 12 Retirement and Investment Office employees on Friday.
The goal of the bonuses is to encourage the agency’s employees to bring in more money from state investment funds. According to State Investment Board policy, the incentive pay is awarded if the state’s top four funds outperform the market. Those four funds are the Legacy Fund, the Public Employees Retirement System, the Teachers Fund for Retirement and Workforce Safety and Insurance.
North Dakota investment board delays action on $1.3 million in employee bonuses

State data indicates only a fraction of the four funds was invested by in-house employees during the period of time the bonuses cover, Cleary wrote.
“This disconnect undermines both the intent of the law and the credibility of the incentive program,” he said in the letter.
In a memo to the State Investment Board, Retirement and Investment Office Executive Director Jodi Smith noted that “internally managed” is not defined in state statute.
She said that under even the most strict interpretation of the phrase, the agency’s funds performed well enough in 2025 for staff to receive the bonuses. 
The agency’s staff was directly managing roughly $400 million in investments as of June 30, 2025, the memo says. Those investments made $7.9 million in returns in the preceding year.

Smith wrote that “internally managed” could also be interpreted as any money with the Retirement and Investment Office’s oversight, even funds that are invested by external managers.
State law doesn’t say the bonuses have to be proportional to the performance of internally managed investments, she added.
Based on the Retirement and Investment Office’s benchmarks, which were set by a third-party first, the agency’s largest four funds outperformed the market by $191 million in 2025.
The agency’s bonus policy was reviewed by a separate third-party firm and approved by the State Investment Board in May 2024.
Rep. Mitch Ostlie, R-Jamestown, in a Wednesday letter raised similar concerns as Cleary.
Ostlie also noted that he and Cleary submitted a request for an Attorney General’s opinion on whether the State Investment Board has continuing authority to pay out the bonuses.
“With so many questions still outstanding, it does not make sense for the State Investment Board to pay out any bonuses at this time,” Ostlie wrote.
Attorney general ‘prioritizing’ request for legal opinion on North Dakota investment staff bonuses

An assistant attorney general within the Attorney General’s Office previously advised that the agency could legally award the pay, Smith said at a December meeting.
Seven of the bonuses exceed $100,000, and the largest exceeds $293,000. If the State Investment Board approves the bonuses, it would be the first time the state awards them.
Smith has said bonus pay is common in state investment programs.
The Legislature gave the Retirement and Investment Office the authority to create the program in 2023, with the agency enacting it the following year.
Cleary said he’s considering asking for another Attorney General’s opinion to see if the bonus program is complying with the statute’s internal management requirement. He also said he may bring legislation to clarify state law in a future legislative session.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent activity in Kansas City and across the United States inspired a Democratic state legislator to attempt to hijack a Republican’s bill to read ICE “shall have no jurisdiction or power within the state of Kansas or its political subdivisions.”
Rep. Susan Ruiz, a Democrat from Shawnee, proposed on the House floor Wednesday revising the text of Republican Rep. Rebecca Schmoe’s bill, which stated international organizations such as the United Nations and the World Health Organization have no power in Kansas.
In the place of international organizations, Ruiz inserted ICE.
“We need to stand up,” Ruiz said. “And we at least need to say — each community, each city council, each county’s commissioners need to make a statement to say that ICE is not welcome in their communities, and if they are there, they should be unmasked and well-identified, and they should carry body cameras.”
Ruiz rooted the explanation of her amendment in the recent death of former Kansas City resident Renee Good, who an ICE agent shot and killed at point blank range through Good’s windshield in Minneapolis.
“Tragedy always happens because people that get those kinds of jobs or go for those kinds of jobs don’t have a lot of training at all. And we saw,” Ruiz said. “We saw all the videos and you can see for yourself.”
Ruiz connected ICE activity across the country to Kansas City, describing the effects of an increased presence of immigration agents. Fewer people are going to work, the grocery store and schools, she said.
She mentioned news reports of a horde of ICE vehicles in Kansas City, Missouri, targeted ICE raids at gas stations and speculation of ICE using the Kansas City area as a staging ground, which has not been verified.
Schmoe, a Republican from Ottawa, proposed House Bill 2204 in 2025. It was the first piece of legislation debated on the House floor in the 2026 legislative session, which began Monday.
When Democrats pressed her to explain the motivation behind the bill, Schmoe said its purpose was to close “a loophole that can be exploited.”
“I had a group of my constituents come to me, and they were very concerned with global entities making decisions for Kansas, instead of Kansans,” she said.
During a March 2025 hearing for the bill, a senior legislative staff member called it “a statement bill as it is anything,” and called into question whether the international organizations targeted have any existing authority in the state.
Schmoe challenged Ruiz’s amendment, and a rules committee ruled it not germane, halting Ruiz’s effort.

Stephen Webber, a Columbia Democrat, speaks in the Senate on Sept. 10, 2025 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri Senate Democrats blocked debate on more than a dozen gubernatorial appointments Thursday, bringing the chamber to a standstill and vowing to spend the year slowing down the legislative process. 
For two hours Thursday, a Democratic filibuster prevented the Senate from considering appointments by Gov. Mike Kehoe to various boards and commissions. With no end in sight, the Senate adjourned for the week without taking the appointments up for a vote. 
Democrats argued their stall tactics were an effort to restore the Senate’s role as the more deliberative legislative chamber that thoroughly vets bills before they go to governor. 
“It’s probably more important than ever that there is at least one entity in this government that serves as a speed check,” said state Sen. Stephen Webber, a Columbia Democrat, “that says ‘whoa, we’re gonna pump the brakes and do our jobs.’ If we do, we’ll get better public policy.”
The filibuster was the fulfillment of a threat Democrats made before the legislative session began earlier this month. 
The party, which holds only 10 of the Senate’s 34 seats, fumed as Republicans invoked a rarely-used rule to cut off debate four times last year to pass an abortion ban amendment, repeal expanded sick leave, put initiative petition changes on the ballot and approve a gerrymandered congressional map. 
Most expected Democrats to show up on the session’s first day ready to engage in procedural trench warfare, using the few tools available to them to slow the chamber to a crawl and exact some measure of payback.
But the Senate proceeded for the first two weeks with no drama though mostly ceremonial and procedural business. That changed Thursday, when it tried to conduct its first real business of the year by approving gubernatorial appointments.
Missouri lawmakers expect tension as they return for election-year legislative session 

Democrats didn’t focus on Republicans cutting off debate last year. Instead, they spent Thursday afternoon digging into legislation they argue the Senate rubber stamped that should have received more scrutiny.
State Sen. Tracy McCreery, an Olivette Democrat, pointed to last year’s capital gains tax cut, which was approved by the Senate despite concerns that the estimated $111 million annual revenue reduction was inaccurate.
The state budget director now says the revenue loss could be as much as $500 million the first year and $360 million annual thereafter.
Webber said the same could be said of the gerrymandered congressional map. A lawsuit claims one Kansas City precinct was accidentally placed in two different districts, something Webber said would have been avoided if the Senate didn’t rush the map through the process. 
 “If we’d spent some time drawing it ourselves,” he said, “that wouldn’t have happened.”
Democrats also questioned whether the Senate is doing a good enough job vetting gubernatorial appointments. 
“Somewhere along the way,” McCreery said, “it feels like senators have slowly been removed from the process.”
State Sen. Steven Roberts, a St. Louis Democrat and member of the Senate Gubernatorial Appointments Committee, asked President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Shelbina Republican and the committee’s chair, about the process to approve reappointments.
“My understanding is, for reappointments, and these are folks who may be reappointed for six years later, we don’t really have any background information on them,” Roberts said.
“You would have to ask the Governor’s Office,” O’Laughlin said. 
Roberts said he was struck by the lack of public hearings of the state Board of Cosmetology and Barber Examiners. O’Laughlin is sponsoring two nominees for that board.
“It just caught me by surprise that by this one, it seems like all of their meetings are closed, and it gives me a little bit of concern,” Roberts said.
Roberts asked O’Laughlin whether the board sends newsletters about their decision-making process.
“No, I have never even thought about that,” O’Laughlin said. “I do think a lot of people feel that way about us.”
“But all of our meetings have to be public,” Roberts said.
“Well, supposedly,” O’Laughlin responded.
State Sen. Jason Bean, a Holcomb Republican, said Thursday’s Democratic filibuster didn’t come as a surprise. 
“We knew this was going to  occur, because of what happened last session,” he said, adding: “Up until now, we’ve run pretty smoothly. We’ve still got a long session ahead of us, and we’ll just see what that brings.”
Democrats have no intention of killing the appointments that were stalled Thursday. But Webber said the filibuster is a sign of things to come, with his party trying to force a much slower legislative pace and demanding more oversight.
“I’ve had Republicans come to me,” he said, “and say they want to get back to the way the Senate has been in the past.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091025_webber1-1024x667.jpg,,,2026-01-15 14:57:28.918251

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Less than 48 hours after terminating over $14 million of Mississippi mental health grants, the federal government informed organizations that their funding will be fully restored. 
The U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration cancelled nearly $2 billion of grants across the country Tuesday, according to NPR. In Mississippi, government health centers, private nonprofits and universities were told to stop all work funded by those grants — mainly related to addiction and children’s services. 
By Tuesday evening, Mississippi Today had learned about roughly $9.2 million of cancelled Mississippi grants. Later that night, the state Department of Mental Health accounted for an additional $4.9 million that had been terminated to Mississippi State University, University of Southern Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Health Institute. 
Wendy Bailey, the mental health department’s executive director, said Tuesday night there could have been other terminated grants her agency hadn’t learned about yet. 
A Tuesday letter the federal mental health department sent to grantees said the cancellations were final because “no corrective action could align the award with current agency priorities.” But by Thursday morning, the agency sent the same organizations a short message to “disregard the prior termination notice and continue program activities as outlined in your award agreement.”

Nationwide, all $2 billion of the cuts from earlier this week were reversed, according to Roll Call. A spokesperson for the federal agency did not answer Mississippi Today’s call and email about the terminations and restorations.
Four of Mississippi’s 12 community mental health centers, local public organizations that serve people regardless of their ability to pay, were set to lose $8.7 million. Phaedre Cole, the Mississippi Association of Community Mental Health Centers president and the executive director of a center that serves the Delta, called the unexpected terminations and restorations “whiplash.” 
She said she was encouraged by the swift, bipartisan pushback to protect critical Mississippi mental health services that were already underfunded. But the previous 48 hours had left her and other executive directors frazzled. 
“It’s terrifying to us because we know we are the place of last resort for thousands of people across the state,” she said. “If we are to disappear, we will not disappear quietly.”
Shortly after receiving notice that the Department of Mental Health’s grant had been restored Thursday, Bailey said the last two days had been a whirlwind. But she’s grateful Mississippi mental health providers can continue providing important services. 
“We must remember that behind these dollars are services and supports that are being provided to our neighbors, friends, family members, and people throughout our communities,” she said.
Communicare, the community mental health center serving Oxford and the surrounding counties, was set to lose more than any other organization Bailey’s department heard from. Melody Madaris, Communicare’s executive director, said the losses would force her agency to cut back on preventing opioid overdoses, restructure services for school children and halt other planned programs. 
Thursday morning, before she had officially heard that the federal government would restore her grant, Madaris said services funded by federal grants are often the ones most people don’t notice unless they need them — transporting people from rural homes to receive antipsychotic medications, working with food banks to deliver meals to patients and other resource-intensive services. 
“Those are the things we do to keep our community healthy,” she said. “Without the federal funding, these are things that we won’t be able to do as much of.” 
Right after the federal government sent her an email restoring the funds, she texted Mississippi Today: “A sigh of relief and back to work as usual helping the citizens of Mississippi struggling with mental health and substance use issues.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/29162137/3X0A8546.jpg,,,2026-01-15 14:57:28.918251

The Iowa Board of Medicine has charged Dr. Kahlil Jihad Andrews of Coralville with practicing medicine in a manner that is harmful or detrimental to the public, professional incompetence, and improper management of medical records.
The board has not publicly disclosed any information as to the conduct that gave rise to the charges other than to say it took place while Andrews worked as a surgeon in the Coralville area. State records indicate the charges stem from two separate investigations initiated in 2023 and 2024.

A hearing on the charges is scheduled for March 25 and 26, 2026.
“Dr. Andrews appreciates the board’s commitment to fulfilling its critical mission while he continues to honor his own commitment to the best possible outcomes for his patients within the standard of care,” Andrews said in a written statement to the Iowa Capital Dispatch. “He respectfully, but categorically, denies the allegations and charges asserted by the board and will proceed to defend his care while ensuring that he receives the due process to which he is entitled under Iowa law.”
Andrews has been an Iowa-licensed physician since October 2012.
Six Iowans have alleged negligence
In 2018, Andrews and Physicians Clinic of Iowa were sued for negligence by Marcia Bowman and LaDonna Fairbanks of Linn County, each of whom alleged they were left with deformities resulting from operations performed by Andrews. Andrews and the clinic denied any wrongdoing. Both women subsequently dropped their lawsuits. The available court records make no mention of any out-of-court settlements.
In 2022, Sandra Strunk-Sosalla of Linn County sued Andrews and Dr. Andrews Plastic Surgery for negligence related to an alleged chin implant deformity. After corrective surgery was performed to install a second implant, Strunk-Sosalla allegedly lost movement in her lower lip, which led to problems with speaking and eating, as well as the removal of the second implant and a series of treatments at the Mayo Clinic. The case went to trial, where a jury found no fault with Andrews’ care.
In November 2023, Jocelyn Meade of Johnson County sued Andrews and Dr. Andrews Plastic Surgery, alleging she sustained nerve damage and significant scarring resulting from liposuction and an abdominoplasty performed by Andrews. Andrews and the clinic denied any wrongdoing, and the lawsuit was dropped in April 2024 with no mention of an out-of-court settlement.
Also in November 2023, Kelsi Ziemann of Polk County sued Andrews and Dr. Andrews Plastic Surgery for negligence related to liposuction and several other procedures that allegedly led to infections, swelling, scarring and disfigurement. Andrews and the clinic have denied any wrongdoing. Court records indicate the case remains open and active.
In December 2025, Taylor Worrall of Dubuque County sued Andrews and Dr. Andrews Plastic Surgery for negligence related to liposuction and other procedures that allegedly led to infections, blistering, abscesses and disfigurement. The case remains open and active, although court records show Andrews and the clinic have not filed responses to the allegations, and there has been no activity in the case for 13 months.

(Photo by Alyssa Chen/Minnesota Reformer)Melissa Berg is a paid personal care assistant for her friend, a disabled person who needs 24/7 care. In December, Berg received a memo from AM Home Healthcare, the St. Paul-based agency she works under, saying that it won’t be able to cover payroll because the state’s late making payments.
Without the promise of pay, some PCAs in the agency haven’t been showing up for work, Berg said.
“It just enrages me because disabled people are so devalued and, again, you see the most vulnerable among us suffering first,” Berg said.
The Minnesota Department of Human Services delayed all payments to providers of 14 Medicaid services in the first weeks of a new system — called “prepayment review” — designed to prevent fraud. Providers of Medicaid services said the delay caught them by surprise and interrupted payrolls, leaving older and disabled Minnesotans without care.
The anti-fraud measure that seems to have ensnared legitimate providers and their vulnerable clients was introduced last year amid an ongoing scandal enveloping the administration of Gov. Tim Walz, who at the time was running for a third term before dropping out this month.
DHS suspended all payments for the 14 “high-risk” Medicaid programs on December 30, suddenly leaving many providers to operate without money they have come to expect to get every two weeks. Payments have started to be resumed this week, though many are still missing.
DHS put out a memo that payments would resume this week, but on Wednesday, the department told the Residential Providers Association of Minnesota that claims submitted on December 24 and 25 were not included in those payments due to an early deadline not communicated to providers, said Rebecca Johnston, the executive director of RPAMN.
DHS is now figuring out whether it can pay those remaining 40% or so claims from December sooner, Johnston said; if not, some providers will be left without payments for two more weeks, which could leave them at risk of closing their doors.
A spokesperson for DHS said the department does not yet have information on unpaid claims. At a Wednesday press conference, John Connolly, state Medicaid director, said the next payment for claims is in two weeks.
Zak Mohamed, who runs AM Home Health Care, said that he’s been trying to take care of clients in the place of employees who are — understandably, he said — not working because he can’t guarantee them payment. AM Home Health Care has yet to receive payments since December for services included in the new prepayment review process, which comprise more than half of what the agency gets from the state. Mohamed said the company paid one payroll from its reserves, but, without DHS payments, will be unable to pay its employees.
Many of AM Home Health Care’s 45 clients depend on their caregivers to survive, Mohamed said.
“If people don’t get their medications in time or if people can’t get out of their bed… You know, I do the best I can,” Mohamed said.
Hailey Grattan, the director of operations of Golden Heart Home Health Services, said the Brainerd agency also has yet to receive reimbursements for services included in the prepayment review process. The agency is still missing over $200,000 in state payments that it expected at the end of December — nearly its entire reimbursement amount.
Grattan said Golden Heart is currently continuing to meet payroll, though she worries that future disruption could leave staff without pay and individuals without care.
DHS is “not providing us with any help or any clear timelines,” Grattan said.
A fragile industry
Prepayment review has been touted by Walz and DHS officials as one of several administration’s efforts to stop fraud in Minnesota human service programs. The 14 high-risk services in the review process include Housing Stabilization Services, a program so riddled with fraud it was shut down.
Communication around the prepayment review system has disoriented providers ever since it was publicly unveiled by Walz’s office in October.
After an initial bout of confusion, providers were under the impression that only claims deemed suspicious would be delayed or held, though under state law, the state can take up to 30 days to pay “clean claims” without complications and 90 days to pay all other legitimate claims.
Then, at the end of December, a few days before they expected to be paid, providers found out that all payments in the 14 high-risk programs were suspended, not just payments for suspicious claims.
Connolly acknowledged that his department has gotten feedback from providers on the new review program.
We “want to make sure that we’re as clear as we can be in terms of setting expectations about what’s coming and hearing feedback about the hardships that providers are experiencing,” Connolly said.
Josh Berg, a service director at Accessible Space, an assisted independent living provider, said that he supports DHS reviewing claims before they’re paid, but is frustrated with DHS’ implementation and “not thinking through the consequences.”
Had they been warned that all payments would be suspended for two or more weeks, Berg said, providers would be more prepared. Berg said Medicaid waiver service providers often operate on thin margins. Accessible Space has other streams of revenue and received most of its delayed payments this week, allowing it to remain stable despite the delay. Other providers are less financially secure; Berg said he spoke to a provider who took out a second mortgage on their home to make payroll.
“We’re in a much more fragile position than I think anybody ever contemplated,” Berg said.
Political pressure to prevent fraud
Fraud in Minnesota’s human services has drawn significant attention from President Donald Trump, who has used the issue to attack Minnesota’s Somali-American community and justify sending thousands of immigration agents to the state. Announcements of federal actions that claim to address fraud in Minnesota, but threaten Minnesota’s social programs, ticked up following a viral video by influencer Nick Shirley claiming to uncover new fraud in Minnesota daycares.
The Trump administration has said it intends to withhold $2 billion of Medicaid funding from Minnesota, a decision which Minnesota officials said they are appealing. In response to a directive from the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the state announced last week that it will stop allowing new providers in the 14 high-risk Medicaid programs for six months at some point in the future.
Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, who has prosecuted several social services fraud cases in Minnesota, said in December that he suspects at least $9 billion paid to the 14 high-risk Medicaid programs since 2018 have been fraudulent.
In a press conference Wednesday, however, Connolly said that very few claims — twenty or so — were rejected in the first round of prepayment review.
On Tuesday, Connolly said that the review process was implemented with a “compressed timeline” relative to similar past projects “because of the urgency of the situation.”
Sen. Jim Abeler, R-Anoka, said the implementation was rushed, and that the department should have known that creating the system would take more time and consideration. He said he had advised DHS to put the review system on hold until it brought on legitimate providers to strategize.
“Maybe it’s a great idea to set up a really good algorithm with rubrics and pre-screen things that are way out of the norm,” Abeler said. “But you can’t start those up on a dime.”
Abeler, whose party has long criticized Walz for not being tough enough on fraud, said that prominent Republicans might be reticent to speak about prepayment review system problems because they would be seen as “pro-fraud if they criticized the governor’s program here.”
In an email to Connolly, Sen. John Hoffman, DFL-Champlin, said that he plans to convene hearings about the design of the prepayment review system when he returns to work following his attempted assassination in June.
The prepayment review process’s “implementation raises serious and immediate concerns — not about the goal of program integrity, which I fully support — but about the lack of concrete assurances that Minnesotans who rely on these services will not be harmed in the process,” Hoffman wrote.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/D50F29A6-E905-4213-8769-F4A44F0BD615_1_201_a-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-15 13:57:18.048783

The park’s “preferred alternative” would entail construction of a 5-mile stretch of highway that avoids much of the canyon where 2022 infrastructure damage was most severe. The NPS seeks comment through Feb. 4.
The post Yellowstone mulls new permanent routes to replace flood-damaged highways appeared first on WyoFile .","After a catastrophic 2022 flood destroyed highway sections in Yellowstone National Park, park authorities acted fast to make the repairs necessary to reopen. Because the former North Entrance Road between Gardiner, Montana, and Mammoth Hot Springs was eaten away by floodwaters and unpassable, the work included constructing a temporary highway to connect the towns. 
Though that temporary highway has provided year-round access since the disaster, the project was not engineered for longevity. 
“It’s done a fantastic job of keeping the park connected to the second-busiest entrance in the park,” Yellowstone National Park Superintendent Cam Sholly said Wednesday during a meeting. “But it does not have the same type of engineering, it doesn’t have the same type of life cycle that you would see with a modern-day road.”
The National Park Service recently released an environmental assessment on plans to rebuild a new permanent North Entrance Road. It’s available for public review and comment through Feb. 4. 
The agency’s “preferred alternative” would entail creating a highway route that utilizes some segments of the pre-flood North Entrance Road but mainly stays out of Gardner Canyon, where major flooding damage occurred. It would construct roughly two and a half miles of new road, including several bridges. In addition, it would add 134 parking spaces and 19 turnouts over the 5-mile length of the road.

This map illustrates the three different route paths for Yellowstone National Park’s permanent highway. The park’s preferred alternative is in red, while the pre-flood route is shown in purple and the Old Gardiner Road is in blue. (National Park Service) 

“Overall, the [preferred alternative] will provide a better driving experience than the current route and provide greater resiliency compared to the pre-flood road alignment,” an informational park service video stated. 
The changes will impact major veins of traffic in a park that receives upwards of 4 million visits annually.
Long-term solution
The June 2022 floodwaters wiped out bridges, inundated campgrounds and pulled entire portions of highway into the river. The North Entrance Road, one of only two routes offering year-round vehicle access, was among of the hardest-hit areas. 
As a stop-gap solution, federal agencies improved the Old Gardiner Road, a historic, gravel road connecting Mammoth Hot Springs to the North Entrance. Constructed in 1879, the Old Gardiner Road was the original entrance road to Yellowstone until it was replaced in 1884. 
The improved Old Gardiner Road had an estimated design life of only five to 10 years, due in part because it’s located on slow-moving geologic slides and poor soils, according to the NPS. Additionally, due to an urgent need to complete construction before the winter of 2022, it was not built to American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials standards. 
In its efforts to find a more lasting North Entrance Road solution, the NPS has worked in cooperation with the Federal Highway Administration to identify four alternative plans for the North Entrance route. They include: 

No action: Maintaining the Old Gardiner Road as is and conducting maintenance, repairs and potential re-engineering as needed. 
The Center Alignment: Creating a new route largely outside of the canyon but also using some reclaimed segments of the old North Entrance Road, and redesigning the Old Gardiner Road as a multi-use trail. This is the agency’s “preferred alternative.”
The OGR Alignment: Reengineering the Old Gardiner Road to current NPS Park road standards with wider lanes and shoulders, and reclaiming sections of the old North Entrance Road canyon alignment.
The Gardner Canyon Alignment: Rebuilding the flood-damaged old North Entrance Road in its previous canyon alignment and redesigning the Old Gardiner Road as a multi-use trail.

Risk, resiliency
“Lots of folks have said, ‘Hey, just keep the road that you built in 2022 the same,’” Sholly said. But because that road wasn’t built for longevity, “no action here is not going to be an option for the long term.”
The agency is leaning toward the preferred plan, he said, “primarily because building back in the canyon’s got a lot of risk.”
Even though Sholly is confident the agency could rebuild infrastructure designed to endure future floods in the canyon, he said, the significant rockfall potential in the corridor makes it an unappealing option.

Center Alignment, the NPS-preferred alternative, “represents the best balance between resiliency and project cost by avoiding the Gardner River Canyon as much as possible, thus staying out of the floodplain while maintaining the [Old Gardiner Road] alignment for recreational and emergency vehicle use,” the NPS project page reads.   
In the wake of the floods, there have been many discussions about how the park can prepare for the kind of large and unusual climate events that are becoming more common — like the June 2022 rain-on-snow event that precipitated such quickly rising waters. The road project assessment and planning process included evaluations of climate change and evolving hazards within the road corridor, according to the NPS, and climate models helped inform the development of the alternatives. 
The bottom line, Sholly said, is that there’s no perfect solution. “This is a very, very important project. We’ve taken time to really do our best to analyze every factor possible, because we want to get this right.”
The NPS will review all comments received during the 30-day public review period and make changes to the environmental assessment or the alternatives if warranted. A final decision will be issued in the spring or summer, according to the agency.

Land in this area of the Mississippi River Delta is sinking, both on its own and in tandem with rising sea levels. (Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)A new study says river deltas around the world aren’t just disappearing because of rising seas, but because the land itself is sinking down into the waters, either as fast or faster than the rising oceans.
Researchers found some of the most rapid sinking is happening along the Mississippi River Delta in Louisiana. The study aims to better guide coastal restoration in disappearing river deltas around the globe, helping leaders, scientists and people living in coastal communities with hard decisions on what can — and should — be saved.
“Coastal areas account for less than 1% of the entire land area we have,” said Leonard Ohenhen, a professor at the University of California, Irvine and the lead author of the study. “But a whole significant population, more than 600 million people, live in those areas.”
The study, published this week in the academic journal Nature, found that the contributions of  subsidence, or slowly submerging land, to disappearing coasts is often overlooked. 
The fight to preserve rapidly sinking land has been a decades-long battle in the Mississippi River Delta, as well as a source of contention between scientific and political figures in the state. But deltas across the world are sinking, too, and fast. 
“You have a sort of a hodgepodge of different reasons why deltas are sinking,” said Ohenhen.
He said river deltas naturally sink to some degree, with sediment carried downstream by rivers piling up and pushing down on the spongy, soft land already there. But humans can accelerate this natural process, by engineering rivers like the Mississippi and by extracting groundwater or oil. 
“Relative sea level rise in the area is also really important. That’s the sea level rise plus subsidence,” said Alisha Renfro, coastal scientist with the National Wildlife Federation. “It really helps us understand where we can make investments in restoration long-term that we might actually be able to hold on to.”
Lack of sediment is the main driver of subsidence in the Mississippi River Delta, said Ohenhen, creating hotspots of rapidly sinking pieces of land amid slightly more stable areas. Most of the deltas studied in the paper, around 70%, have subsidence problems primarily due to groundwater withdrawal, but some, like the Amazon and Mississippi River Deltas, had subsidence issues driven by the disappearance of river-carried sediment to replenish the delta’s land.
This map from the report shows which areas of the Mississippi River Delta are sinking. Areas in red and yellow are areas of land sinking more rapidly, while spots in blue and purple are building land upwards. (University of California, Irvine)
Putting hard numbers to and pinpointing causes of subsidence — like human activity — is invaluable to restoring coastal land. 
“I would say that really validates what, not just my organization, but what a lot of people have recognized for a long time — that this was a significant contributing factor in subsidence,” said  James Karst with nonprofit advocacy group Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana, referring specifically to the lack of sediment sent to the Delta. 
Decisions about what pieces of the coast can be saved are even more urgent with the cancellation of two large-scale restoration projects in Louisiana. 
Known as sediment diversions, both the Mid-Barataria and Mid-Breton plans would have diverted freshwater from the Mississippi River into surrounding wetlands. They were scrapped by the state because of the prospective impact on fisheries like oysters, crabs and other marine species. Fishers and oyster harvesters celebrated the projects’ demise, while scientists and coastal restoration advocates warned that time is running out to save the coast. 
“In light of the cancellation of Mid-Barataria, I think what we, everybody, should be thinking of is, ‘What is the next best thing?’” said Karst. “Clearly it is not going to move forward, but we can’t do nothing.”
“People should be aware that we are in a part of the world that is changing, and that is changing rapidly,” said Karst. “If we want to position ourselves as individuals and as communities, we should be anticipating these changes and anticipating how they will affect us.”

While the average rate of subsidence for the Mississippi River Delta is around 3.3 millimeters per year, said Ohenhen, some areas of Louisiana are sinking at a rate of 3 centimeters per year, one of the fastest of all the deltas studied. That is paired with a sea level rising by at least 7 millimeters per year along the Gulf Coast, he said, also one of the highest rates in the world.  This puts some areas of Louisiana’s land at higher risk of loss than anywhere else. 
“In the Mississippi River Delta, for example, that is one of the only deltas in the world where you have active relocation of people from the delta due to land loss,” said Ohenhen. “The time that we need to respond to these changes is now before the situation gets significantly worse.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_8951-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 13:57:18.048783

The Trump administration slashed then restored roughly $2 billion in mental health and addiction services grants between Tuesday and Wednesday evening, leaving Connecticut officials and advocates concerned and scrambling, then relieved and exhausted.
The cuts would have affected some 2,000 programs across the country. On Wednesday advocates and agencies struggled to assess the impact, only to learn that the decision had been reversed that evening. 
The reversal comes after a day of extreme pressure from advocates and lawmakers on the state and national level, who called the decision to cut the grants “pointedly cruel,” “nonsensical,” “unconscionable and unjustifiable.”
A spokesman for Gov. Ned Lamont said the quick reversal caused a sense of “whiplash.”
“As if the Trump administration’s arbitrary cuts to mental health and substance use funding weren’t cruel enough, the whiplash of cutting and then restoring those funds only deepens anxiety for the people who depend on these services,” said Rob Blanchard, a Lamont’s spokesman. “For those seeking help, these programs are a critical lifeline. While the restoration of funding is a relief, it should never have been halted in the first place. The public and nonprofits deserve the certainty of knowing they can count on the federal government.”
On Thursday, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, held Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. responsible.
“After national outrage, Secretary Kennedy has bowed to public pressure and reinstated $2 billion in SAMHSA grants that save lives,” DeLauro said in a statement. “These are cuts he should not have issued in the first place. He must be cautious when making decisions that will impact Americans’ health. Our policy must be thoughtful — not haphazard and chaotic. This episode has only created uncertainty and confusion for families and health care providers. I hope this reversal serves as a lesson learned. Congress holds the power of the purse, and the Secretary must follow the law.”
“To say I’m relieved is an understatement,” said Rep. Cristin McCarthy Vahey, D-Fairfield, co-chair of the Public Health Committee, on Thursday morning. “But I am still left wondering, why? The initial decision resulted in a day of uncertainty, with agencies scrambling and scared. The people supported by these SAMSHA (Substance and Mental Health Services Administration) funds need steadiness and certainty not chaos and fear.”
The Wheeler Clinic, which has several locations in the state, was among the providers that received letters late Tuesday that grants had been cancelled. President and CEO Sabrina Trocchi spent the day meeting with colleagues, calling congressional representatives to make the case for the cut programs, and trying to figure out how to retain employees who would otherwise have to be laid off. 
Three programs would have been cut — one that delivered medication assisted treatment in Waterbury, one working to help incarcerated people reenter their communities in Greater New Britain, and one that trains emergency responders to better assist people experiencing a mental health episode. On Thursday afternoon, Trocchi received notice that the funds had been restored. 
“Many staff yesterday across a number of these federally funded programs left their employer, not knowing if they had a job the next day,” Trocchi said. “It’s just absolutely devastating.” 
She said the reversal gave her hope, but the events of the past 24 hours have left her feeling uneasy.
“One of the takeaways for me is that this isn’t the end. We know that we’ve been dealing with this now for approximately a year, where there are either executive orders that are coming out, or contractual language changes at the federal level that impact the work we do and how we do it,” Trocchi said. “This last example of receiving these termination letters overnight that were immediately [rescinded], it really continues to increase the chaos within the day to day work that we’re trying to do, and our work is just so critical and needed today more than ever.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0207_SR_WheelerClinic_010-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 13:57:18.048783
,DC,2026-01-15 18:01:12+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,US Senate Dems launch midterm affordability push with focus on housing costs,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-dems-launch-midterm-affordability-push-focus-housing-costs,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Democrats began detailing their affordability agenda Thursday ahead of the November midterm elections, starting with a focus on housing. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said during an event at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, that if Democrats regain control of the House and Senate they would pass legislation to expand rental assistance, reduce barriers to home ownership, build more housing and address predatory practices. Schumer listed several statistics he finds concerning, including that the median price of a home has gone up by 55% since the coronavirus pandemic, that rent has risen by one-third and that the average age for a first-time home buyer is 40. “That's a record high,” he said. “That's a devastating statistic that should shake up everyone in a position of power at the federal, state or local levels.”Schumer said the outline for housing is just the first of several cost-of-living policy proposals Democrats will detail this year as they seek to sway voters in key districts and states to vote for their candidates over Republicans.Democrats, he said, will also focus on how to curb the rising cost of groceries, electricity, child care and health care as part of the midterms messaging. On housing, Schumer said Democrats will focus on legislation that would incentivize construction companies to build more housing to address shortages throughout the country;expand rental assistance, including Section 8 vouchers for low-income families;reduce barriers to home ownership;expand the low-income housing tax credit;allow the Department of Housing and Urban Development to use the Defense Production Act to purchase “housing materials in short supply”;create an agency focused on advanced research into housing issues, similar to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency; andblock “predatory companies” from being “allowed to gobble up entire neighborhoods so easily and turn them into profit machines.”Democratic bills would provide down payment assistance, lower the cost of mortgage insurance, expand access to portable mortgages and “reform homeowners insurance which is now at a crisis level and so important for people who can’t afford that down payment,” Schumer said.  Democrats have relatively good odds of winning back control of the House during the November midterm elections, especially since the president’s party tends to lose that chamber two years after taking power. Campaigns to regain control of the Senate will be much more difficult for Democrats, who face challenges keeping seats in Georgia and Michigan, while trying to flip Republican seats in Alaska, Maine, North Carolina and Ohio. Even if voters were to give Democrats control of Congress, leaders in the party would still need some Republican buy-in to move legislation past the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster and need President Donald Trump to sign legislation into law, unless they had the two-thirds needed in each chamber to override a veto. A ‘family conversation’Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz said during a panel discussion with Illinois Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth that was moderated by CAP President and CEO Neera Tanden that he’s been “radicalized on housing” and pressed for members of the party to talk realistically about issues with supply and affordability. “And the reason is that our shortage nationwide, but especially in Hawaii, is so acute that people can't make the math work anymore,” Schatz said. “In Hawaii, people are paying more than 50%, all-in, of their income for housing, either rental housing or paying a mortgage. And what I have come to realize is that we are the problem.""Schatz argued that the government “is the primary impediment to alleviating the shortage” and said that realization has led him to have some “very difficult conversations.” In Hawaii, he said, there are environmental and cultural protections intended to safeguard “special places” but that have ended up applied more broadly, impeding housing development. “They were not originally conceived to prevent a walk-up apartment building on the corner of Eisenberg and King to house Native Hawaiian families,” Schatz said. “And yet those same laws are being weaponized against people in Hawaii even being able to live in the state of Hawaii.”Schatz said Democrats must be honest with voters about what their housing policies would mean for communities throughout the country, contending the party needs to “solve the politics” around expanded housing before it can tackle the policy debate. “I actually think we have to have this family conversation around the politics of housing and realize that some of our base voters in the suburbs, who are otherwise good all the way down the line on all the progressive issues, also want to prevent a nurse or a firefighter or the disabled or the elderly or the student from living anywhere near them,” Schatz said. “And we have to have that conversation in the progressive coalition.”Rethinking inspections, other processesDuckworth said some solutions to housing could come through rethinking the processes in place now, similar to how the Department of Veterans Affairs changed its approach to homeless veterans. “VA used to say, 'You have to get clean and sober, and then we'll give you a voucher to get into an apartment.' And so it made no sense, right?” Duckworth said. “So we had to change the thinking to what the homelessness community had been working on, which is reduction of harm — get them into the housing and then work on getting them clean and sober,” she continued. “And by changing that thought, we were able to immediately start pulling veterans off the streets, put them into housing units where they immediately were also getting counseling, getting treatment.""Duckworth compared the sometimes slow process of housing inspections that can stop construction with the way the government approaches vehicle safety as one possible way to get things moving faster. “With automobiles, we say, ‘This car that you're manufacturing must be able to withstand a crash at 35 miles an hour into a brick wall.' And then when they meet and get that car approved, when we go buy that car, we don't have to take that car to get it inspected from top to bottom, like we do with homes,” Duckworth said. She added: “So why would we not say to homebuilders, especially (prefabricated) homes, if you come to VA and you are willing to get two models of your home, pre-inspected, pre-approved, then when a veteran builds a new home and they say, 'Hey, I'm going to choose one of these models that already has a VA good housekeeping seal of approval,’ they can shortcut that inspection process.""",,,,2026-01-15 13:57:18.048783

Nichols, an appointee of President Trump, ruled construction on Empire Wind could proceed as he considers the merits of the government’s order.","WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge Thursday cleared the way for a New York offshore wind project to resume construction, a victory for the developer who said a Trump administration order to pause it would likely kill the project in a matter of days.
District Judge Carl J. Nichols, an appointee of President Donald Trump, ruled construction on the Empire Wind project could go forward while he considers the merits of the government’s order to suspend the project. He faulted the government for not responding to key points in Empire Wind’s court filings, including the contention that the administration violated proper procedure.
Norwegian company Equinor owns Empire Wind. Spokesperson David Schoetz said they welcome the court’s decision and will continue to work in collaboration with authorities. It’s the second developer to prevail in court against the administration this week.
The Trump administration froze five big offshore wind projects on the East Coast days before Christmas, citing national security concerns. Trump has targeted offshore wind from his first days back in the White House, most recently calling wind farms “losers” that lose money, destroy the landscape and kill birds.
Developers and states sued seeking to block the order. Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of plans to shift to renewable energy in East Coast states that have limited land for onshore wind turbines or solar arrays.
On Monday, a judge ruled that the Danish energy company Orsted could resume its project to serve Rhode Island and Connecticut. Senior Judge Royce Lamberth said the government did not sufficiently explain the need for a complete stop to construction. That wind farm, called Revolution Wind, is nearly complete. It’s expected to meet roughly 20% of the electricity needs in Rhode Island, the smallest state, and about 5% of Connecticut’s electricity needs.
Orsted is also suing over the pause of its Sunrise Wind project for New York, with a hearing still to be set. Dominion Energy Virginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, plans to ask a judge Friday to block the administration’s order so it can resume construction, too.
The fifth paused project is Vineyard Wind, under construction in Massachusetts. Vineyard Wind LLC, a joint venture between Avangrid and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, joined the rest of the developers in challenging the administration on Thursday. They filed a complaint in District Court in Boston.
Robin Shaffer, president of Protect Our Coast New Jersey, said the administration was right to stop construction on national security grounds. He urged officials to immediately appeal the adverse rulings and seek to halt all work pending appellate review. Opponents of offshore wind projects are particularly vocal and well-organized in New Jersey.

Empire Wind is 60% complete and designed to power more than 500,000 homes. Equinor said the project was in jeopardy due to the limited availability of specialized vessels, as well as heavy financial losses.
During a hearing Wednesday, Judge Nichols said the government’s main security concern seemed to be over operation of the wind turbines, not construction, although the government pushed back on that contention.
In presenting the government’s case, Associate Attorney General Stanley Woodward, Jr. was skeptical of the perfect storm of horrible events that Empire Wind said would derail their entire project if construction didn’t resume. He disagreed with the contention that the government’s main concern was over operation.
“I don’t see how you can make this distinction,” Woodward said. He likened it to a nuclear project being built that presented a national security risk. The government would oppose it being built, and it turning on.
Molly Morris, Equinor’s senior vice president overseeing Empire Wind, said in an interview that the company wants to build this project and deliver a major, essential new source of power for New York.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26014477594025-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 13:57:18.048783

The census is completed in January.,"No.


Homelessness increased by 9.5% in 2025, according to the state’s annual census of the homeless population. This includes people living in shelters and the “unhoused,”  meaning those living outside or in a place not meant for human habitation, like a car.
The state provides an official point-in-time count of the sheltered and unsheltered people in the state. Last year’s count found a total of 3,735 people lived in shelters or outside in January 2025, compared to 3,410 in January 2024. 
The number of people who are unhoused, however, increased by 45%, rising to 833 from 574 in 2024.
Connecticut providers have argued they need more funding for years. Recently, however, the Trump administration cut federal funding for homelessness services.
Gov. Ned Lamont announced in December he planned to use funding from the recently created Emergency State Response Reserve to support homelessness prevention and response services throughout the state.

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The University of Arkansas abruptly revoked its offer to the incoming dean of its law school after key Republicans complained about her background and legal position on protections for transgender athletes. 
The school cited “key external stakeholders” in its decision to withdraw its offer to Emily Suski less than a week after she had been announced as the law school’s new dean. 
A UA spokesperson did not return requests for comment Thursday morning, but the university said in a statement that it “decided to go a different direction in filling the vacancy” following feedback “about the fit” between Suski and the university’s vacancy.

Suski did not return requests for comment Thursday morning. 
“University officials are very grateful for Professor Suski’s interest in the position and continue to hold Professor Suski in high regard,” the statement reads. “We wish Professor Suski well as she moves forward with her career.”
The move comes as Republican lawmakers in Arkansas and elsewhere have taken steps to restrict what can be taught in the classroom. Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who has advocated for prohibiting transgender athletes, has complained about schools indoctrinating students. 
One of the lawmakers who objected to Suski’s appointment was Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester, a Cave Springs Republican.
“There’s no way the people of Arkansas want somebody running and educating our next generation of lawyers and judges [to be] someone that doesn’t understand the difference between a man and a woman,” said Hester, who also cited her position on transgender athletes as a concern.
Suski had been one of 17 law professors who had signed on to a brief defending transgender students’ right to play on the teams of their gender identity. The brief was filed before the U.S. Supreme Court, which heard a pair of cases about state laws banning transgender athletes.
Arkansas has a similar law in effect.
“Although Title IX does not guarantee a student a right to win or even make the team, supra, it does protect every student from being denied the benefits of school sports based on sex, including sex-based generalizations that do not apply to them,” the brief Suski joined said.
Hester said he was surprised that “this person who has these beliefs made it through the initial scanning processes.” He also said he heard from several concerned individuals as soon as Suski’s selection was made public.
Republican Attorney General Tim Griffin also had raised concerns about Suski, his office said. 
“The Attorney General simply expressed his dismay at the selection and his confidence that many more qualified candidates could have been identified,” spokesperson Jeff LeMaster said. “He never requested or even contemplated that the offer be rescinded, but he applauds the decision nonetheless.”
Sam Dubke, a spokesperson for Sanders, wouldn’t say whether the governor was involved in the university’s decision.
“Governor Sanders appreciates the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, for reaching the commonsense decision on this matter in the best interests of students,” Dubke said in a statement.
Rep. Nicole Clowney, a Fayetteville Democrat and adjunct lecturer at the law school, said in a social media post that she was concerned about the university’s aboutface. 
“I am still gathering information but based on what I’ve learned so far, it seems clear that what happened is a horrifying, unprecedented, and absolutely unconstitutional abuse of state power,” Clowney said. 
Suski is a professor and associate dean at University of South Carolina’s Joseph F. Rice School of Law. Suski’s areas of expertise include education law, particularly Title IX and civil rights in public schools; health and poverty law; and clinical legal education, according to her USC biography. She holds degrees from Georgetown University Law Center and the University of North Carolina.

Ron DeSantis, the Florida Supreme Court Thursday ended its reliance on the agency in charge of accrediting law schools.
This ends Florida’s more than three-decade dependence on the American Bar Association, the state’s sole accrediting body. Because the ABA does not serve Floridians’ “best interest,” five of six justice agreed, Florida will reach out to alternative accreditors, effective Oct. 1.
This comes just one day after DeSantis bashed the ABA as a left-wing organization undeserving of being the “arbiter of legal education,” and months after Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier accused the organization of discriminating against Roman Catholics.
“The Court is persuaded that it is not in Floridians’ best interest for the ABA to be the sole gatekeeper deciding which law schools’ graduates are eligible to sit for the state’s General Bar Examination and become licensed attorneys in Florida,” the Court wrote in their nine-page opinion.
Although graduates of ABA-accredited law schools will continue to qualify to sit for the state’s General Bar Examination, so would graduates of law schools accredited by any “subsequently recognized programmatic accreditor,” the opinion continues.
‘Woke’ and ‘partisan’
Higher education in Florida has become a political battleground under DeSantis, who’s vowed to root out and abolish any and all “woke” policies within the state’s institutions. He’s led the nation in overhauling university structures, flipping the progressive New College into a “Hillsdale of the South” while installing GOP leaders as the head of multiple state colleges and universities.
DeSantis’ efforts inspired a nationwide conservative movement. Earlier this week, Texas became the first state in the nation to end its reliance on the ABA, the national agency that serves as the primary accreditor for multiple states.
In a press conference Wednesday, DeSantis slammed the ABA while his staff took to social media and hinted that reporters should “stay tuned” on potentially throwing out the accrediting organization, which has been Florida’s only accrediting body since 1992.
“The ABA is a very, very partisan activist organization, and you have a right to be that, but you should not then be the arbiter of legal education,” DeSantis said.
This echoed comments made by Uthmeier in November, demanding the ABA not “horsewhip” St. Thomas University College of Law, a Catholic institution in Miami that the ABA in August declared out-of-compliance with the association’s anti-discrimination and equal-opportunity standards.
In March, the Florida Supreme Court created a workgroup to propose alternatives to the ABA in the Bar admissions process, partially because “reasonable questions” had arisen about the ABA’s accreditation standards on “racial and ethnic diversity in law schools and about the ABA’s active political engagement.”
This came amid DeSantis’ moves to create a new accreditation system for state universities.
Not all justices agreed on tossing the ABA. Justice Jorge Labarga, the sole non-DeSantis appointee left on the court, dissented.
“I cannot agree with this action,” he wrote. “Regrettably, under the guise of expanding the accrediting agencies for law schools in Florida, the majority has taken the extraordinary step of divesting the ABA of its three decades long status as the sole accreditor of Florida law schools.”
Of note, DeSantis on Wednesday appointed Adam Tanenbaum to the Supreme Court to fill a vacancy left by Charles Canady. This means six out of the seven justices are now DeSantis appointees. Labarga, the lone standout, must retire in October 2027 when he reaches the age limit of 75.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fl_supreme_court-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 12:57:53.044099

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Maj. Gen. Stephen Osborn, the adjutant general of the Iowa National Guard, began his 2026 Condition of the Guard address Thursday by honoring the loss of two Iowa National Guard service members.
Osborn’s remarks come just over a month after Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard of Marshalltown and Sgt. Edgar Brian Torres-Tovar of Des Moines, were killed in Palmyra, Syria, during an attack by a lone gunman associated with ISIS. Three other Iowa National Guard members were injured, and another U.S. civilian was killed in the Dec. 13, 2025 attack.
“We begin today with heavy hearts, reflecting on the profound loss of two of our finest soldiers,” Osborn said. “Yet even in this time of sorrow, we have witnessed something powerful — the strength, the unity and the compassion of the state of Iowa. On behalf of the entire Iowa National Guard, I want to express our deepest gratitude for the overwhelming outpouring of care and respect shown to our fallen heroes and their families.”
Osborn thanked Iowans for their support of the National Guard, the soldiers and their families following the attack, in addition for the continued support of the three Guard members who were injured. He also honored the more than 1,800 Iowa soldiers and airmen who are still deployed in the Middle East, where they “continue to carry out critical missions that are ongoing, demanding and vital to our national security.”
Lt. Col. Jeremy Taylor, deputy state chaplain in the Iowa National Guard, was brought to the podium to lead the chamber in prayer honoring Torres-Tovar and Howard, saying “these young men, Lord, were willing to walk through the shadow of the valley of death, doing what they loved and serving others.”
“They embodied what you taught us that there is no greater love than this, than to lay down one’s life for one’s friends,” Taylor said.
In her Condition of the State address Tuesday, Gov. Kim Reynolds also honored the Iowans who died in the attack. Howard’s wife, parents and brother attended the address while the Torres-Tovar family held a memorial service at their local church Tuesday night. Reynolds said “their service lives on — in the families they cherished, in the communities they strengthened and in the freedoms they helped preserve.”

Osborn said in light of the tragedy in Syria, he understands there are many Iowans wondering, “Why is the Guard in Syria?”
“That’s a fair question, and one that I want to clearly address today,” Osborn said. “The National Guard is a core component of our nation’s total force, providing 40% of the army and 30% of the Air Force operational force. … The National Guard is no longer a strategic reserve to be utilized in times of the most extreme national emergencies. We are and will continue to be, the primary combat reserve in the United States Army and the United States Air Force.”
The adjutant general said Iowa National Guard members are in Syria “and many other locations around the world” because the reserve forces serve as a critical fixture in Iowa’s national security efforts both domestically and abroad.
Osborn’s address did not touch on many specific requests for the Iowa Legislature in 2026, but he asked for support in the National Guard’s modernization efforts in coming years. Over the next decade, he said, the Guard and the whole U.S. military system will “undergo one of the most significant periods of transformation and modernization in our history” as it adapts and integrates new technologies like artificial intelligence, autonomous systems and space assets, as well as making organizational and personnel changes.
“In the Iowa National Guard, transformation is underway as we build a more advanced and capable force,” Osborn said. “We are launching new Air National Guard units designed with next generation technologies and creating new and challenging training opportunities for our airmen. We are also proactively shaping our future army force structure to be highly relevant in a changing world, while simultaneously delivering value here in Iowa.”
An important component of these efforts are infrastructure investments, Osborn said. He highlighted several federally funded efforts across the state, thanking the state’s congressional delegation for their support authorizing the $220 million investment to replace the runway and parking ramp at the 185th Air Refueling Wing in Sioux City, which was included in the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act. Funds for this effort still must be appropriated before the runway project can begin, he said.
He also pointed to new Readiness Center in West Des Moines that opened in 2025 as a vital facility for supporting the Army National Guard “well into the future,” as well as the Guard breaking ground on a $14 million federally funded Army National Guard equipment maintenance facility in Sioux City. In 2026, Osborn said, the National Guard will begin construction on another $14 million federally funded project in Waterloo, for an equipment maintenance facility.
As the year begins, Osborn said three priorities will guide the National Guard: a focus on service members through recruitment and support, conducting trainings that prepare the force for “increasingly complex missions at home and abroad,” and modernization of the Guard’s structure, infrastructure and equipment.
“This transformation strengthens the readiness of the Iowa National Guard, while creating opportunity for Iowa through economic growth, job creation and stronger communities, ensuring the Iowa National Guard remains ready for the future,” he said.

Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo, speaks during a debate on the rules for the chamber as part of the organizational session on Dec. 4, 2024. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan announced Thursday she will not seek reelection this year.
Hogan, of Fargo, a longtime leader of the Democratic-NPL Party, said it was a difficult decision to step away, but family matters needed to come first.
“My husband is 90, so it was a family decision and it’s very bittersweet,” Hogan said in an interview with the North Dakota Monitor. “It has nothing to do with the Legislature. It just has to do with my family’s needs.”
She represented Fargo residents of District 21 in the North Dakota House of Representatives starting in 2009 and has served in the Senate since 2019, including the two previous legislative sessions as minority leader. Prior to her time as a lawmaker, she worked in human services for 40 years, which included 28 years as director of Cass County Social Services.
Hogan said she’s proud of the strides the state has made in improving behavioral health and the Legislature’s workplace harassment policy. One thing she hopes she’s remembered for is her ability to work with almost anyone.
“I think I bring a deeply respectful approach to all opinions,” she said. “The power of being nice, I think, sometimes we forget about it.”
She added she thinks state government is in a better position now than when she began serving in the Legislature 17 years ago.
“The thing that gives me hope is the new governor,” Hogan said of Republican Kelly Armstrong. “He’s very practical and he knows the legislative process and understands the difference between policy making and administration of the executive branch, and that gives me a lot of hope.”
Hogan said she plans to stay involved in issues that she is passionate about as an advocate.
Former North Dakota U.S. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp was among Democrats who praised Hogan’s legislative service Thursday.
“She consistently delivered wins for the marginalized, and her advocacy for health care, Medicaid recipients, and our state’s children will be hallmarks of her service,” Heitkamp said in a statement.
Sen. Josh Boschee, D-Fargo, assistant Senate minority leader, said Hogan’s legacy extends beyond her time in state government.

“Well before she was elected to the Legislature, she played an instrumental role in improving the quality of life for our citizens and working toward a healthier North Dakota,” Boschee said in a statement. 
The Cass County Democratic-NPL District will meet Feb. 7 to endorse candidates for the Legislature and delegates for the party’s convention in Bismarck on March 6-7.
Hogan also had advice for anyone considering running for elected office.
“If you are curious and want to learn about democracy, step into the arena,” Hogan said. “Whether it’s city, county, school boards, library boards, until we get people committed to making democracy work, our democracy won’t thrive, and everyone should be involved at some point.”

Ally Seifried, R-Claremore, left, on Thursday at the state Capitol in Oklahoma City. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Education committee leaders in the Oklahoma Legislature have put literacy laws at the forefront of their yearly policy goals, further entrenching childhood reading as a top focus for the 2026 legislative session.
Only 26% of Oklahoma public school students made a proficient score on statewide reading tests last year. Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, and Rep. Dick Lowe, R-Amber, who lead Senate and House committees on K-12 schooling, both announced legislation this week aimed at improving those outcomes.
While groups like the Oklahoma State Chamber advocate for more students to repeat third grade if they’re too far behind in reading, Pugh and Lowe’s literacy plans would make student retention a possibility in first and second grade, as well. 
Third grade is too long to wait, Pugh said.
“My approach is we identify and intervene as early as possible so that we never have to get to that point,” he said in an interview with Oklahoma Voice. “For kids that do get to that point, then yes, there’s going to be a retention component, but as early as possible, you identify and you intervene.”
Lowe and Pugh both suggested schools give students summer tutoring and an end-of-summer reading test before finalizing retention decisions.
Pugh’s plan, outlined in Senate Bill 1778, also would require a transitional year before retention. Students in a transitional year would stay with their age-group cohort but spend the school year receiving extensive remediation in reading concepts they still need to master. If not caught up after a transitional year, a student could repeat a grade.
Oklahoma’s current reading instruction law, which Pugh co-wrote in 2024, removed a requirement that students repeat third grade if they score well below their grade level. 
Only 2% of third graders were retained even with the requirement still in place, according to a 2023 report from the Oklahoma State Department of Education.That’s because the state allowed students multiple exemptions and other avenues to avoid it.
“To me, with all the exemptions on the books, it was almost like we needed to start over and reevaluate,” Pugh said. “And now we have.”
Rep. Dick Lowe, R-Amber, proposed a bill to add reading interventions for struggling students. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)
Lowe’s House Bill 3023 would prohibit schools from using only digital technology for reading intervention. Most instruction would have to come directly from a teacher, specialist or literacy coach trained in the science of reading.
Retired teachers would be allowed to contract with the Oklahoma State Department of Education to work as reading coaches, under the bill.
“Literacy remains a major concern for Oklahoma parents, educators and policymakers,” Lowe said in a statement. “House Bill 3023 might not be exactly the right solution, but now is the time to bring ideas to the table and have thoughtful discussions about how we can all help improve literacy for all students.”
The state should increase funding for districts to hire reading specialists to work with students, Pugh said, and to grow the Education Department’s literacy instructional team that provides professional development to schools. He said he also will push to increase public school funding overall with the goal of offsetting inflation and adding more school days.
He and the Senate Appropriations Committee will reveal the potential budget impact and a funding source for the investment in the coming weeks, Pugh said.
As the state continues to grapple with a shortage of qualified educators, Pugh also proposed several new incentives for teachers: a $2,500 base salary increase for all teachers, a $10,000 tax credit for teachers who work in the same district for at least seven years, six weeks of paternity leave for school employees and doubling the college scholarship funds available for aspiring educators.

Not all of the new incentives have a fiscal impact estimate yet, Pugh said, but he expects the $2,500 teacher pay raise to cost between $135 million and $140 million.
Lowe’s HB 3022 would prohibit schools from hiring uncertified adjunct instructors to teach core subject areas in pre-K through sixth grade. That would include math, science, English language arts and social sciences. Senate Education Committee Vice Chairperson Ally Seifried, R-Claremore, filed a similar bill.
Lowe’s legislation also would require adjunct teachers to have at least a high school diploma. State law currently doesn’t require a minimum education level for adjunct instructors, only that they have “distinguished qualifications in their field.”
“These bills reflect years’ worth of conversations with educators, parents and community leaders,” Lowe said of his policy agenda. “My goal is to build thoughtful, practical policy that strengthens Oklahoma’s education system and better prepare students for life after graduation while providing consistent, reliable support for our teachers.”

Stewart specifically mentioned a new state law that will bar local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement. Mills allowed it to become law without her signature, though it won’t take effect until 90 days after the current legislative session adjourns. 
State and local police already cannot enforce immigration laws, which are a federal matter, however local authorities have contributed to immigration arrests in Maine, including through traffic stops and 911 calls.
Assistant Senate Minority Leader Matthew Harrington (R-York) claimed that more resources need to be expended on immigration enforcement because of laws like the one that will take effect in Maine later this year.
Gov. Mills OKs restrictions on local involvement in immigration enforcement

The Trump administration vowed an immigration crackdown since he began his second term and his signature spending legislation passed in July increased immigration enforcement funding by tens of billions of dollars.  
“This entire situation is self-imposed and self-created by legislative Democrats and Governor Mills,” Harrington said. Mills did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
This comes as tensions rise across the nation following the fatal shooting by a federal officer in Minnesota. 
Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline and Portland Mayor Mark Dion announced on Wednesday that they are expecting increased federal immigration presence in their communities soon, though neither responded to questions about how they were notified. 
Mills directed Maine State Police to work closely with local police as necessary “to provide whatever support is needed, in advance of and during any potential federal operations” in a video message late Wednesday, in which she also said the federal government “is not welcome” if it plans to be provocative or undermine residents’ civil rights. 
Sheline and Dion urged residents and businesses to know their rights and create a plan in case they are stopped by federal authorities. 
On Tuesday, Trump also threatened financial retribution against so-called sanctuary cities and states with policies against helping U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrest people suspected of living illegally in the U.S.
Trump, speaking Tuesday to the Detroit Economic Club, said he would cut off “any payments” starting Feb. 1 “to sanctuary cities or states having sanctuary cities, because they do everything possible to protect criminals at the expense of American citizens.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GOPbudget-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 12:57:53.044099

Monique Miller, sponsor of a proposal to eliminate property taxes on homesteaded properties within 10 years.A proposed constitutional amendment to go before the voters that would gradually increase the homestead exemption for non-school-related property taxes by $100,000 each year for 10 years advanced in a House committee Thursday.
The resolution (HJR 203), sponsored by Rep. Monique Miller, R-Palm Bay, would, if approved first by the Legislature and then by the voters in November, take effect on Jan. 1, 2027.
“Given that the median home price is about $350,000, most Floridians will have zero non-school ad valorem property taxes by 2030,” Miller told the State House Affairs Committee.
Her proposal is one of a group of measures on property taxes making its way through the House, but whether the Legislature will approve it to go before the voters is in question. There is no Senate companion to Miller’s resolution, and Senate President Ben Albritton and Gov. Ron DeSantis have already said that they believe there should be only one constitutional amendment on the topic in November.
The concept of reducing or eliminating property taxes is controversial, with representatives from some local governments claiming it would devastate their budgets.
The state’s Revenue Estimating Conference has estimated that if the measure passes, it would have a negative cash impact of $4.4 billion and a negative recurring impact of $13.3 billion on local non-school property tax revenues in fiscal year 2027/2028, according to a bill analysis.
Rep. Lindsay Cross, D-St.Petersburg, said she had seen estimates that, under Miller’s proposal, 40 Florida counties would lose close to 40% of their taxing base in the first year.
Jeff Scala with the Florida Association of Counties repeated that statistic, forecasting a $2.9 billion hit to counties in the first year and that by the third or fourth year, “many of the counties are wiped off the rolls.”
“The math doesn’t work. This is fiscal crisis by design,” he said.
Carveouts for emergency services
Proponents of a major property tax reduction such as DeSantis and Florida CFO Blaise Ingoglia contend that local government spending increased disproportionately from 2019 to 2024, and that local governments could afford a reduction in property tax revenue.
Charles Chapman with the Florida League of Cities said that notion was misleading. He agreed property tax revenues have increased in recent years, but said so has the cost of providing local government services, “including facility and infrastructure construction, employee recruitment and retention, [and the] cost of capital equipment replacement.”
Among the members of the public who spoke against the resolution was Dave Shula, a commissioner with Juniper Inlet Colony, a small incorporated town in Palm Beach County. He said that 81% of his city’s revenue comes from property taxes, and the budget this year for police and firefighters is $2.1 million. But if property taxes were eliminated, he said, the city would have just $900,000 in revenue from other sources.
“That would significantly affect our ability to handle that,” said Shula, the son of the late Miami Dolphins coach Don Shula.
The resolution originally would have banned local governments from reducing total funding for law enforcement below levels budgeted in the 2025-2026 or 2026-2027 fiscal years. An amendment was approved in the committee to create a carveout for firefighters and other first respondents from having their budgets reduced.
The resolution has one more committee stop before reaching the House floor. A Senate companion has yet to be filed. Proposed constitutional amendments must be approved by three-fifths of both chambers to get on the ballot.
Meanwhile, a poll by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy on behalf of the nonpartisan Florida Policy Institute released Thursday found that 63% of Florida voters — including 73% of Democrats, 58% of Republicans, and 60% of independents — believe property insurance relief is a higher priority than property tax relief. Only 32% of voters said that property tax relief was the higher priority.
The poll also found that roughly half of Florida voters, 49%, opposed elimination of the non-school property tax on homesteads upon hearing that such a move could result in local governments cutting services or implementing new taxes to make up for the lost revenue. Only 39% of Florida voters supported the proposal while 12% were undecided.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-15-at-9.27.45 AM-e1768496395747-1024x833.png,,,2026-01-15 12:57:53.044099

Student and advocacy groups are pushing back on what they see as further federal attacks on trans youth.

Vermont’s largest school district is being investigated under federal allegations that it has violated laws surrounding transgender student athletes’ participation in sports.
The Champlain Valley School District is among 18 entities in 10 states being investigated by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights “based on complaints submitted to OCR alleging that they have violated Title IX,” according to a press release issued by the department Wednesday.
Title IX prohibits sex-based discrimination in federally funded education. Champlain Valley is the only Vermont school district named in the release.
“In the same week that the Supreme Court hears oral arguments on the future of Title IX, OCR is aggressively pursuing allegations of discrimination against women and girls by entities which reportedly allow males to compete in women’s sports,” Kimberly Richey, assistant secretary for the Office of Civil Rights, said in the release.
CVSD was among the first in Vermont to craft a policy in 2023 affirming the rights of trans and gender nonconforming students. It allows transgender students to use their chosen names and pronouns in most cases, and to participate in activities that align with their gender identity, according to the district’s website.
The U.S. Department of Education considers such policies a threat to “the safety and the equal opportunities of women in educational programs and activities,” according to the press release.
District officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.
Student and advocacy groups are pushing back on what they see as further federal attacks on trans youth.
Aaliyah Washburn, coordinator of culture for the student-run statewide nonprofit group Vermont Student Anti-Racism Network, said she believes everyone has a right to play sports. 
“As a college athlete, when I’m on the field or court, I’m not thinking about another player’s sexual orientation or gender identity, I’m focused on how I can support my team, improve, and win. That should be the reality for most athletes. Sports are about teamwork, growth, and competition, not policing who someone is,” she said in an email.
The continuing debate over transgender athletes’ participation in sports is “a distraction” and “disconnected from reality,” according to a newsletter this week from the statewide LGBTQ+ youth nonprofit Outright Vermont.
“Transgender youth are not a talking point. They are real, brilliant, and amazing people” who deserve being supported and not attacked by adults politicizing the issue, Executive Director Dana Kaplan wrote.
There are very few transgender youth athletes nationwide and even fewer across individual states, he said, and they just want to “have a healthy outlet and participate in school sports alongside their peers.”
Meanwhile, Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark this week joined 11 others to sue the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for “unlawfully conditioning” federal health, education and research funding based on states’ agreement to discriminate against transgender people.
The lawsuit, filed Tuesday, refers to the federal government forcing compliance with a presidential executive order that “seeks to deny the existence of transgender people and impose rigid, unscientific definitions of sex in violation of state laws that protect transgender people from discrimination.”
“This is yet another illegal attack by the President and his administration on transgender people,” Clark said in a press release. “I will continue to stand with transgender Vermonters and use every tool available to defend their rights in our state. I also will continue to fight back against this Administration’s efforts to coerce public institutions into ideological submission.”
This story will be updated.

(Wisconsin Examiner photo)“How sad that indigenous people have to prove they are not illegal immigrants,” wrote Cindy Smith in response to a Facebook posting by the Lac Courte Oreilles (LCO) Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians.
On Jan. 10, the LCO Tribal Governing Board issued an immediate release that it was “closely monitoring recent events that took place in Minneapolis, and around the country involving Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Agents.”
Just a few days before, on Wednesday, Jan. 7, a 37-year-old woman, Renee Good, was shot and killed in her vehicle by an ICE agent in South Minneapolis.
Over 1,000 ICE agents were in the Twin Cities area as a major campaign that has received national attention to detain and arrest those who had reportedly violated federal immigration laws. The agents not only tracked down those without legal status to reside in the U.S., but also questioned and detained others because of their appearance, such as skin color and accent, whether or not they were legal residents or citizens. Caught up in the crackdown were at least five Native Americans who were detained, including four Oglala Sioux from South Dakota and one from the Red Lake reservation in Minnesota.
Jose Roberto “Beto” Ramirez, a Red Lake descendant, told a reporter for ICT that he was trailed by an SUV and  when he parked in a grocery store parking lot, he was dragged out of his vehicle without explanation and detained for several hours. Ramirez said he felt like he had been “kidnapped”. He  was subsequently released without any charges.
News reports from the Twin Cities have stated that Native Americans, who are fully U.S. citizens, had been approached by ICE agents regarding their immigration/citizenship status.
In response to Native Americans being stopped by ICE, several Wisconsin tribes issued statements voicing concern over the stops and also offering advice to their members.
“We humbly offer our sincere condolences to all those affected by these incidents,” reads the Lac Courte Oreilles release, which assured members that the Tribal Governing Board “is actively working to ensure our tribe and members are as safe as possible and is reviewing policies to implement access restrictions in areas that are non-public, employee-only, and restricted to ensure our facilities are entitled to every legal protection possible.
“In these unprecedented and uncertain times, it is essential that we remain vigilant and protect one another. We encourage everyone to stand together in solidarity to support each other spiritually, mentally, emotionally, and physically. The safety and well-being of all tribal members continues to be our highest priority. We will do everything in our power to protect our members, reservation, government buildings, and enterprises.”
Jon Greendeer, president of the Ho-Chunk Nation posted Wednesday, Jan. 14, “My office and social media feeds have been buzzing with concerned tribal members following the recent shooting of an American Citizen by an armed ICE official. Now with the news of alleged door-to-door campaigns, the threat literally hits home.”
Also on Jan. 14, the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians posted the following: “The Tribe wants to be clear: we do not support or cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Our priority is the safety, dignity, and protection of our tribal members. We are deeply concerned by reports coming out of Minnesota involving the detention of tribal members, as well as ICE actively being reported in areas near our community. As indigenous people to this land, our identity should never be questioned, challenged, or used as a reason for detention.”
On Jan. 12, the St. Croix Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians issued a statement on “opposing ICE and affirming tribal sovereignty,” which said, in part, that tribal leaders “strongly oppose the actions and presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) including the targeting of community members, the detention and separation of families, and the ongoing disregard of human rights.”
On Jan. 10, the Stockbridge-Munsee Community alerted members on Facebook that Native Americans “are being caught up in raids and detained.”
Like several of the tribal posts, the Stockbridge-Munsee tribe encourages its members to be prepared for being “stopped, detained and questioned regarding your citizenship.”
Even though tribal members are U.S. citizens, Wisconsin tribal members are being encouraged to carry their tribal, state and federal IDs and even birth certificates.
On Jan. 14, the LCO tribe said it would be issuing ID cards for enrolled members who live off the reservation in the Twin Cities at the Minneapolis American Indian Center Rotunda, and like other tribes, LCO noted that fees are being waived for the ID cards.
On Jan. 11, the Oneida Nation offered detailed guidance if members encountered ICE agents:

 “Stay calm and ask for identification.”
 “Always carry your Oneida ID.”
 “If detained, say ‘I want to speak with an attorney.’”
 “Report encounters to Oneida Police Department.”
 “At home, keep the door closed and request a judicial warrant.”

Several tribes are notifying members that if the ICE agents do not have a warrant signed by a judge, the agents do not have permission to enter their home without consent.
ICE agents have been observed approaching homes and businesses with administrative warrants issued by ICE, which lack the legal weight of a judicial warrant.
Some of the tribes are advising members if ICE comes to their doors without  a judicial warrant to not only not open their doors, but also report the presence of the ICE agents to tribal police.
The Ho-Chunk Nation said it will provide its members with door signs for law enforcement that “alert” officers of the “state, tribal and federal citizenship” status of the residents and communicate that “agents may not enter the property without a valid warrant.”

Free.,Trump threatens to use Insurrection Act and deploy military in Minnesota,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-threatens-use-insurrection-act-and-deploy-military-minnesota,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump threatened on Thursday morning to send the military into Minnesota to stop protests, following another shooting by immigration agents that injured one person, seven days after an agent fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis.Writing on his own social media platform, Trump said he would invoke the Insurrection Act, a 19th-century law empowering the government to deploy the military domestically to “repress insurrections and repel invasions.”“If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT, which many Presidents have done before me, and quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great State. Thank you for you attention to this matter! President DJT,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.The law grants an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the military from performing domestic law enforcement.The Insurrection Act was last invoked in 1992 under President George H. W. Bush in response to civil unrest that included the deaths of 63 people, following the acquittal of four white police officers charged with beating to death Black driver Rodney King. The statute has been used about 30 times since the country’s founding, according to records kept by the Brennan Center for Justice.Protests erupted across the Twin Cities after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good in south Minneapolis on Jan. 7.The demonstrations escalated Wednesday night after a federal immigration agent shot and injured a man in north Minneapolis. According to a statement issued by the Department of Homeland Security, a man crashed his vehicle and ran away as agents were “conducting a targeted traffic stop” at 6:50 p.m. Central time. An agent fired “a defensive shot to defend his life” after the man and two bystanders “attacked the law enforcement officer with a snow shovel and broom handle,” according to the statement. The agent shot the man in the leg, according to the department. The statement described the man as “an illegal alien from Venezuela who was released into the country by Joe Biden in 2022.”States Newsroom’s Minnesota Reformer was unable to confirm the account. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said in a late-night press conference that the man was transported to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.The Reformer reported that scores of demonstrators arrived at the scene, sparking a back-and-forth with agents, who deployed tear gas and flash bangs. Agents detained at least two people after someone threw fireworks at the agents. At least two vehicles believed to be used by federal officers were vandalized. The clashes largely stopped by 11:30 p.m., according to the Reformer.Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey asked for calm and reiterated his call for the Trump administration to remove ICE from the city.Trump surged more ICE agents to Minneapolis following the fatal shooting of Good, bringing the total to roughly 3,000 — far outnumbering the city’s 600 local police officers.",,,,2026-01-15 11:57:22.309716

Jim Pillen delivers his State of the State address Jan. 25, 2023. (Courtesy of the Unicameral Information Office)LINCOLN — With a projected $471 million budget deficit on the horizon, Gov. Jim Pillen looked to the state Department of Health and Human Services for the largest chunk of his proposed budget cuts.
Pillen previewed his preferred mid-cycle adjustments to the state’s biennial budget Thursday during his annual State of the State Address. Overall, the governor’s changes would reduce state spending by 0.4% in the current fiscal year and by 1.8% in fiscal year 2027.
Across the whole of state government, Pillen proposes $495 million in spending cuts over both years, the current one and next. Calculations from his office indicate this would lead to Nebraska having a $125 million surplus by the end of FY 2027, a projection partially based on expected increases to state revenues.
While the last year has seen a mixed bag of monthly tax revenues, State Budget Administrator Neil Sullivan argued that state tax receipts have been gradually increasing over the last decade.
Roughly 30% of the cuts Pillen is proposing would come out of DHHS, the largest state agency. Pillen’s plan proposes a $22 million cut to the department this year and a $130.4 million cut next fiscal year.
Sullivan said the DHHS cuts would be covered by staffing adjustments, increasing federal funding and “replacing expensive contracts.” The governor’s plan proposes the agency use more than $25 million to convert roughly 360 outside contractors to in-house positions.
On staffing adjustments, Sullivan said there would be no need for new layoffs to meet the budgeted reductions.
“The changes are already done,” Sullivan said.
Of the proposed DHHS cuts, one of the largest would be to the state’s Aged and Disabled Waiver program, which would be reduced by more than $14.1 million. AD waivers allow aging Nebraskans and those with a disability to remain at home.
Sullivan said broad-based provider rate increases under the program led to increasing costs Nebraska shouldered that “got so far out of line.” He said the governor wants to take a more strategic approach.
“We can’t be paying four times the cost of nursing homes so one person can stay home,” Sullivan said. “We can’t be paying [for] 24 hours of services for someone that lives with their disabled family member.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Some AD Waiver recipients and caregivers told the Examiner the program has been a “lifeline.” They say the reimbursements help stabilize incomes, as many caregivers and recipients might be unable to work outside the home due to the need to care for a loved one 24/7.
The Governor’s Office could not immediately confirm how much the proposal would cut from the program, if approved. DHHS officials previously said annual costs totaled $383.6 million in mid-2025, compared to $91 million in mid-2016.
Pillen’s proposal also boosts the budgets of some programs within DHHS, which brings the total reduction for the department to $152 million. Some notable increases include an additional $32.7 million to Children and Family Services, and an increase of $56.5 million to cover a higher-than-expected increase in Medicaid-eligible individuals.
In a somewhat surprising move, Pillen’s budget proposal would not make any changes to state appropriations for the University of Nebraska. Last year, Pillen proposed a 2% decrease in state funding for the university, but lawmakers landed on a modest increase of roughly $8.7 million per year.
On top of filling the projected budget hole, Pillen hopes to pass $170 million in new property tax relief, according to Sullivan. However, he noted that change is contingent on state revenues increasing enough to meet that amount.
Sullivan said much of Pillen’s budget plan relies on cash fund transfers, a staple of the governor’s budget strategy since he took office. The overall impact would cut more than $80 million over what Pillen’s team identified as “idle cash funds.”
Sullivan said some of the cash funds they considered have not been touched in over a decade. In previous years, state officials were looking for excess cash balances, Sullivan said. This time around, all cash funds were weighed.
“We looked at everything,” Sullivan said.
Other highlights of the governor’s budget proposal include:

$18.4 million reduction in special education reimbursements for FY 27
$19 million reduction to Tobacco Products Administration Cash Fund
$50.7 million increase to Water Recreation Enhancement Fund
$31.6 million reduction to Department of Revenue Operations in FY 27
$22 million reduction to Kinship Foster Care program
$15 million increase to Business Innovation Act
$11.9 million added to Nebraska’s school funding formula, the Tax Equity and Educational Opportunities Support Act
$23.8 million increase to Nebraska Capital Construction Fund

(Getty Images)Nevada’s unemployment rate has typically ranked among the nation’s highest for years, going back to the Great Recession.
Paradoxically, the state also has a lot of job openings, Gov. Joe Lombardo noted on a local podcast in December.
So why is the unemployment rate high while a lot of job openings go unfilled?
“They’re not quality jobs,” Lombardo said. 
“Especially in the service industry, the dollar per hour is just not high enough for them,” and the job doesn’t pencil out if, for example, child care costs as much or more than the job pays, Lombardo explained.
Last summer when announcing his campaign to oust Lombardo, Attorney General Aaron Ford recounted how not long ago he had asked his son, who was graduating from college out of state, if he was going to come home.
“He said, ‘Dad, why would I come back to Nevada? You have no jobs.’” 
His son “said out loud what a lot of people in the state have been thinking,” Ford said.
Ford and Lombardo seem to agree on one thing: Nevada’s economy is a low-wage affair.
And that’s not all they agree on, unfortunately. 
Both also expound the long-standing and deeply ingrained Nevada conventional wisdom that the best and surest and only way to increase the quality of jobs in Nevada is to attract different types of jobs than the ones Nevada already has. 
As Lombardo put it on the podcast, Nevada needs to “change who we’re trying to attract.”
Similarly, at his campaign announcement, Ford touted his support while in the Legislature of policies “to bring in new sectors, like tech, like clean energy, and advanced manufacturing, to create more good-paying jobs.” 
That hard-wired faith in “economic development” based on “incentives,” shared by Lombardo, Ford, and most state elected officials of both parties, has resulted in public subsidies for a football stadium, a baseball stadium, a couple phases of Tesla’s factory complex, a film and video industry tax credit program (authored by Ford), and scores of other projects and ventures, most recently an infestation of water- and power-guzzling data centers. 
Alexis Hill, the Washoe County Commissioner who is running against Ford in the Democratic primary for governor, is among a minority of Nevada politicians who have openly blasted economic development as usual.
“This type of economic development has been the Republican and Democratic establishment’s go-to for a decade, and it hasn’t worked,” Hill declares.
Nevadans may never know if Tesla, the football field, etc. would have come to the state without the state providing tax breaks and other subsidies. 
But with Lombardo’s remarks on a podcast in December and Ford’s remarks while announcing his campaign to oust Lombardo in July, both men effectively conceded Hill is right: Economic development based on giveaways to business has failed to deliver as promised. Nevada job openings are still, as Lombardo put it, “not quality jobs.”
The real jobs of tomorrow
Just because jobs aren’t considered “quality” doesn’t mean they aren’t crucial to the economy and the people who live in it.
Over the next decade, the occupation with the highest projected numeric growth — by far — is home health and personal care aides, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
In 2023, state legislators passed, and Lombardo signed, legislation raising the minimum wage for home care aides to $16 an hour. It was a victory for workers. It was also inadequate even before it took effect in 2024.
Those Nevada occupations that are, as Lombardo says, “not quality,” are also not going anywhere: The jobs with the third, fourth, and fifth highest projected numeric growth over the next decade are “stockers and order fillers,” “fast food counter workers,” and restaurant cooks. As with home health and personal care aides, the median annual pay for those occupations is less than $40,000. 
In other words, the jobs we’ve got are not only, well, the jobs we’ve got. They’re also going to be the occupations that will continue to have the most job openings for the foreseeable future, no matter how many stadiums or battery factories or data centers or YouTube shows the state subsidizes.
Lombardo’s underlying economic pitch is the traditional Republican one, wherein there are few if any things that can’t be fixed by cutting taxes and repealing regulations. Ford has pushed proposals to rein in price gouging and vowed to support public programs that Lombardo doesn’t (free school lunches). Ford was also scheduled to outline a housing proposal Thursday.
Along with opposition to corporate giveaways, Hill has outlined positions to reset property taxes when properties are sold, impose temporary caps on rent, and tax corporate investments as assets. Those alone would earn her the award for most candid candidate for Nevada governor of 2026.
She can also be the most refreshing.
“We tax poor people disproportionately more because of our very high sales tax. We need to bring all industries to this table,” Hill told the Current in response to questions about the state’s lowest-in-the-nation gaming tax.
While Hill derides corporate giveaways, she does call for investments “in our existing businesses,” and “in our workforce,” in at least an echo of the traditional (if downsized) economic and workforce development strategies Nevada has touted for years.
As Hill, Ford, Lombardo, and most Nevada elected officials know (to varying degrees), training for workers and support for businesses are not the only ways to increase job quality and household financial security.
But those are the ways that get the most attention.
And undeservedly so.
Nevada’s $12 minimum wage is an insult and needs to be raised. Thirteen states require employers to provide paid family and medical leave, and Nevada should join them. Erratic and irregular work schedules wreak havoc not only on household finances but family health and well-being. The state’s tax structure preys on the poor. Housing policy isn’t designed to serve people who pay the rent but the industry that collects it. Public transit is an afterthought. There are multiple policies the state can enact or reform (or empower local governments to do so) to directly and indirectly make the jobs Nevadans already have a lot better.
Truly consequential reforms would require political will.
And as prerequisite to political will, politicians and the voters who elect them need to stop disdaining the jobs Nevada already has, as if those jobs (and the people who hold them) are the problem. They’re not the problem. They’re the jobs we’ve got. (And Nevada isn’t special; they’re the jobs most states have got.) 
Politicians and the state’s rather sprawling “economic development” industry should shift their focus to improving the quality of those jobs, instead of disparaging them while fantasizing about replacing them.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-1269178386-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-15 11:57:22.309716

Ryan McLaren, a former aide to U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., announced a campaign to be the state’s next lieutenant governor on Thursday.
The Essex Junction resident’s bid was widely expected. He will face former Lt. Gov. Molly Gray, who announced her 2026 campaign for the state’s second highest office last week, in this year’s Democratic primary. On the Republican side, current Lt. Gov. John Rodgers has said he plans to run again.
“Right now, too many Vermonters feel knocked down or stuck. It’s too hard to find a home you can afford. It’s too hard to find childcare or a doctor. And it’s too hard for working people to make ends meet,” McLaren said in a campaign press release. “But I know what’s possible when we don’t quit, when our communities show up for one another and we all work together.”
McLaren has not previously run for statewide office. He worked in Welch’s office for about a decade, and before that, worked for the Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles as well as the state chapter of the Democratic Party.
This story will be updated.

Seated with Foley is Valerie Moseley, deputy director of the department (Steph Quinn/Missouri Independent).Whether inmates die while in state custody is not used to measure the performance of Missouri’s private prison health care contractor,  the state’s top corrections official told lawmakers Wednesday. 
The 14 performance standards in Centurion Health’s contract track timelines for services, such as dental visits and physical exams, but do not include inmate mortality, said Travis Foley, director of the Missouri Department of Corrections.
During most of a two-hour hearing of the Missouri House Corrections Committee, Foley sought to tamp down reports that Centurion medical staff walked out of the Jefferson City Correctional Center in October. Under questioning from state Rep. Gregg Bush, a Democrat from Columbia, Foley listed several of the performance measures and said he would provide the full list.
“Is any of them mortality?” Bush asked.
“No,” Foley replied.
“Okay, so that’s not actually a measure that we’re measuring from our health care vendor,” Bush said.
“Not in terms of the outcome,” Foley said.
There was no way to know how many people died in Missouri prisons — until now

For several years, advocates for prisoner rights have been sounding alarms about the historically high number of deaths in Missouri’s 19 prisons occurring at the same time the prison population is well off its peak. 
There were 24,454 people in custody on June 30, down from about 33,000 in 10 years. In 2024, a record 139 people died, with 74 due to natural causes, 34 for unknown reasons and 23 due to accidents, a category that includes drug overdoses.
ML Smith, founder of the Missouri Justice Coalition, tracks deaths in custody and told the committee she has received reports for last year of 108 deaths through Nov. 30. Whether inmates are dying should be a major performance measure for Centurion, she said.
The fact that it’s not, Smith said, is “very disturbing for me, because a lot of people die within our prison system.” 
Too many of the deaths classified as natural are young, she said. Of the 74 who died of natural causes in 2024, 34 were in custody for 10 years or less.
When a coroner lists a death as resulting from natural causes, it doesn’t necessarily mean the person received adequate care for the condition that resulted in their death, former Texas County Coroner Marie Lasater told The Independent in early 2025. The term covers an unexpected death for any reason from a treatable medical condition.
Smith wants the state to fire Centurion and find a new provider. Centurion is not meeting staffing standards, she alleged, making people in custody wait for care or miss medications.” 
“Centurion is not adhering to its contractual obligations and metrics,” Smith said, “and (the department) is not holding Centurion to those obligations and the prescribed ultimate consequence, which is the termination of the contract.” 
ML Smith, right, speaks with state Rep. Don Mayhew, a Crocker Republican and chairman of the House Corrections Committee, following a hearing Wednesday on the state’s contract with a private company to provide health care in state prisons (Steph Quinn/Missouri Independent).
No one from Centurion testified during Wednesday’s hearing.
Centurion, once a subsidiary of Centene Corp. but now privately owned, has been Missouri’s prison health contractor since 2021. The company renegotiated its deal in 2024, receiving a boost of about $20 million annually and agreeing to the 14 performance standards, up from five, Foley said.
The company has been fined for failing to meet standards in each of the quarters since the renewed contract was signed, Foley said, paying back a total of $3 million.
Centurion will be paid $212 million this year, Foley said.
Staffing has been an issue, Foley said, but there was no mass walkout of Centurion employees at Jefferson City Correctional Center.
Centurion contracts to provide the equivalent of 73 medically trained employees, mainly nurses, at the prison, Foley said. In the last six months of the year, there were 28 who changed jobs for promotions, resigned or were fired, he said.
In the same period, 19 new employees were hired. 
“There was no single month that had more than 10 departures, no single week had more than three, and no single day had more than two,” Foley said. “So I am not sure that there was anything that constituted an organized walkout.”
Centurion transferred staff into the prison, made sure a supervisory team was on site and hired contract nurses to cover shifts, Foley said. 
The performance standards that must be met include having 90% of a list of services completed in a specified period of time. There are also numerical standards for completing evaluations for substance abuse, tests for tuberculosis and referrals for mental health treatment.
The fines imposed on Centurion are for not meeting those standards, Foley said. While the contract has staffing requirements, the department wants the services provided and that is what the fines cover, he said.
That brought another question from Bush, who in addition to his legislative duties works as a registered nurse.
“Is it the same penalties that they’ve had or are they finding new ways to not live up to their contract?” he asked.
“I would say that it varies,” Foley replied.
Jerika White, criminal justice policy manager at Empower Missouri, a nonprofit that advocates for low-income residents, joined Smith for testimony to counter Foley’s assertions that meeting numerical goals for service are the right standards. She said conditions are getting worse inside prisons as medical staff are strained and overworked.
“I have spoken to more than 20 nurses and former staff members in the past few weeks and they have all shared major concerns with the quality and safety of medical care,” White said. “Eleven nurses stated that they were asked to cover unsafe caseloads, including one nurse who reported that they were assigned to cover an entire wing alone.”
Those conditions are also reflected in what current and former nurses at Jefferson City Correctional Center told the Marshall Project-St. Louis. Employees alleged that Centurion forced them to work long hours and extra shifts, creating a dangerous environment for them and their patients.
State Rep. Kimberly-Ann Collins of St. Louis, the ranking Democrat on the Corrections Committee, said she believes Centurion’s contract should be terminated.
Collins began raising public concerns about conditions in Missouri prisons — and an increasing number of deaths — since she was a freshman lawmaker in 2021. 
“I would like to see shorter wait lines for sick call,” Collins said to Foley. “I would like to see (calls for help) answered. I would like to not see the thousands of letters that I get that are about medical issues.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Foley-Mosley-01142026-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-15 11:57:22.309716

U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-NM) decried the wall in a remote area as a waste of money. (Courtesy U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez’s office)U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez, a Democrat representing the state’s 2nd Congressional District in the southern part of New Mexico, on Wednesday called upon the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to cancel border wall construction along a remote stretch of the state’s shared border with Mexico.
In a statement, Vasquez called the undertaking, which carries a $1.6 billion price tag, the “absolute definition of waste.”
The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” President Donald Trump signed last year contained $150 billion for DHS border and immigration enforcement efforts, which include constructing 49 miles of border wall along the far southwest corner of the state, along with 60 miles of a secondary barrier, according to a news release Wednesday from Vasquez’s office.
According to Vasquez’s office, a company called Fisher Sand and Gravel Co. received a $1.6 billion contract for the construction project along the area known as the state’s Bootheel. Federal contract records show an Arizona-based company by that name received a multi-year contract in late December for “vertical border and waterborne barrier construction” worth up to $1.8 billion. The initial contract period runs through 2028, according to the federal contract website. 
Confusion reigns in New Mexico’s militarized border zone

Vasquez called on DHS to cease construction and invest instead in border-monitoring technology like autonomous towers. 
“American taxpayers will get zero return on their investment if DHS pursues this plan to build a $1.6 billion dollar border wall in one of the most rugged, remote stretches of the U.S.-Mexico border,” he said.
Fisher Sand and Gravel Co. did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
DHS in October announced its plans in the Federal Register to construct additional border wall sections in New Mexico, namely between landmarks known as “Border Monument 1” and “Border Monument 49.” 
According to data from the International Boundary and Water Commission, the area covers a stretch from approximately Santa Teresa in the state’s Southeast corner to the top edge of the Bootheel just east of the Big Hatchet Mountains.
Advocates: Mount Cristo Rey wall will worsen migrant deaths, erosion, habitat loss

Vasquez’s staff visited the area last week, according to the news release, and confirmed that “on-the-ground preparations” for the project were underway, including a new dirt road along the border. 
“It’s ironic that by building roads that lead right to the U.S. border in New Mexico’s Bootheel, the Administration is actually making it easier for folks to enter our country illegally,” Vasquez said.
A DHS spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, in a statement included in the Federal Register notice, did not specify how many border crossers are suspected of entering through the Bootheel. 
But she said the El Paso Sector, which covers El Paso and New Mexico’s border with New Mexico, is “an area of high illegal entry where illegal aliens regularly attempt to enter the United States and smuggle illicit drugs.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/img-f8a0df7a-d45d-4ca5-ad9f-fb44d3d2f14b-1-e1768438014298-1024x935.jpg,,,2026-01-15 11:57:22.309716

Billy Long speaks during a press conference on Feb. 22, 2022, in Jefferson City, Missouri (Madeline Carter/Missouri Independent).Billy Long’s prospects of becoming ambassador to Iceland hit a stumbling block this week, as the former Missouri congressman had to apologize Thursday after facing backlash for his comments suggesting the country should become a U.S. state, with him serving as governor.  
Long, in an interview with Arctic Today, a non-profit Alaska-based digital news publication that covers the Arctic region, apologized for joking with former colleagues in the U.S. House that Iceland will become the 52nd state, after America takes over Greenland. 
The comments set off a firestorm of criticism in the Arctic nation, where Long was nominated to serve as ambassador after stepping down from his leadership role at the Internal Revenue Service last year. 
The Icelandic Foreign Ministry confirmed to Politico that it contacted the U.S. embassy in Reykjavík seeking clarification about the comments. And a member of Iceland’s ruling party said Long’s statement must be taken seriously and represented a fundamental disrespect for the sovereignty of small nations.
“There is no doubt that this is very serious for a small country like Iceland. We need to understand that all the security arguments made by the U.S. regarding Greenland also apply to Iceland,” Viðreisn Sigmar Guðmundsson, a member of Iceland’s parliament, told a local newspaper. 
Icelanders launched a petition urging Foreign Minister Katrín Gunnarsdóttir to reject Long as ambassador. It currently has 2,000 signatures.
Long told the editor of Arctic Today that he was not serious when he made that statement. It was a joke, he said, about Jeff Landry, President Donald Trump’s U.S. Special Envoy to Greenland, becoming governor of Greenland.
“I was with some people, who I hadn’t met for three years, and they were kidding about Jeff Landry being governor of Greenland,” Long told Arctic Today, “and they started joking about me. And if anyone took offense to it, then I apologize.”
Long acknowledged that the reaction was justified, given the tensions internationally regarding Greenland. 
Long, a former auctioneer and talk radio host who represented Missouri in the U.S. House from 2011 to 2023, was confirmed by the U.S. Senate to lead the IRS in June.  Two months later he was pushed out with little explanation and nominated instead to be ambassador for Iceland.

Gretchen Whitmer called for increased collaboration between the U.S. and Canada in auto manufacturing and trade more broadly, while criticizing the impact of tariffs put in place by President Donald Trump as having “taken a terrible toll.” 
“When we fight our neighbors, China wins. We must not turn our backs on each other, not now, not ever,” she said, emphasizing the importance of renewing the USMCA, or United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the trade agreement first established in Trump’s first term.
“The American auto industry of 2025, let alone 2050, cannot exist on an island. To compete against our adversaries, we have to collaborate with our friends,” Whitmer said. “A fully assembled vehicle requires nearly thirty thousand parts. Producing all of them in the United States is impractical and, in many cases, impossible.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Whitmer said there are “zero vehicles” on the road made with 100% U.S. parts, stressing the priority of keeping assembly auto operations in Michigan “as much as possible to protect good-paying union jobs.”
Whitmer emphasized positive momentum in the automotive industry in Michigan — including increased production by General Motors at their Orion Assembly plant and the development of Ford’s BlueOval plant in Marshall. 
She also announced that earlier Thursday morning, she had signed an executive directive to develop geologic hydrogen as a new source of clean energy in Michigan. 
“We’re already seeing a lot of interest in Michigan because we have more potential reserves under our feet than every other state,” she said. “If our hydrogen reserves are proven, safe, and viable, they could lead to a massive economic boom, creating jobs, lowering costs, and reducing our reliance on foreign fuel.”
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer delivers a keynote speech on the second day of the Detroit Auto Show. Jan. 15, 2026. | Screenshot.
She also encouraged more investment in workforce development programs — including passage of two bills introduced by state Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing) to expand Michigan Reconnect. Currently, the program allows any Michigander over 25 years old to earn an associate’s degree or skills certificate, tuition-free. Anthony’s bills would lower the age threshold to 21. 
“All eyes are on Michigan’s economy today, and expanding the reach of the Reconnect program is a guaranteed way to keep our state competitive on the global stage,” Anthony said in a press release after Whitmer’s speech. “I’m proud to have a partner committed to building up and realigning our workforce because there’s nothing more impressive about our state than the people who call it home.”

Details of services
At Stephanie’s request there will be no formal services at this time, she asked for a springtime memorial service. 

With peace in her heart and her loved ones by her side, Stephanie Jill Mapes, age 65, peacefully put her angel wings on and sailed into her new life on Jan. 6, 2026. She leaves her husband Scott Michael Mapes, son Scott Lennon Mapes and his fiancé Cosette Giroux, soon-to-be in-laws Jason and Siersha Giroux, sister Diane Miller, her beloved guardian cat Skunk, Lennon’s godparents David and Diane Bahrenburg, many uncles, aunts, nieces and nephews, and a multitude of friends.
The daughter of Benjamin and Dolores Miller, she grew up in Wilmington, Delaware and learned to ski in middle school. Her ski club took trips to Stowe and that’s how she discovered that she belonged in Vermont.
While a student at University of Delaware, she was drawn to one class: “economics and the law.”  This led her to Vermont Law School where she met Scott.  Eventually, she became the first female president at Paul, Frank & Collins where she stayed for her entire 35-year career. 
She was very involved in her legal community, serving on the board of the Vermont Captive Insurance Association and the Champlain College Board of Trustees, as well as serving on the Lake Champlain Regional Chamber of Commerce board and being involved with the Champlain College Cooperrider Center for Appreciative Inquiry. 
She introduced and educated her entire law firm on her appreciative inquiry approach — a positive, all-inclusive, non-hierarchical, collaborative style. At her retirement party, she declared she had entered “The Year of the Sloth,” which in her words was so wonderful — “Just hanging back in the trees. Out of the fray.  Still in tune but watching from a distance. Moving ever so slowly and deliberately. Hiking. Swimming. Yoga. Biking. Sitting on the beach. Sitting on the porch, or in the late afternoon breeze of nothing more than our own, beautiful backyard.”
On Oct. 1, 2024 Steph was diagnosed with HPV-inspired throat cancer. From that day forward, she said, “I am not going to let this illness define me. It is not going to become me, and I am not going to become it. It arrived as part of my path. To teach me and move me forward. But it needs to move on once it has served its purpose.” 
Stephanie led a rich life and she leaves a profound impact on the world, captured in her words, “So many of us are asking today, how can we be happy and what can we do when so much is wrong in the world. It is so overwhelming. Well, what you say to yourself; what you see and envision becomes reality. If you keep searching for wrong, you will find it. But remember, the opposite is also true. If you seek what is right, in your body, your organizations and the world, you will find that too. It’s out there. Don’t deny yourself from seeing or finding it out of anger, bitterness or cynicism.  Peace is every step. Each of us must become the flickering light that is needed to find our better future.”
There are many people to thank especially over the last few years and over all the years, but we give a special thank you to our amazing community of witches, wizards and goddesses:  Che’ Schreiner, Nicole Smith, Piper Abbott, Emily Davidson, Montana Burns, Michelle Sabourin, Rick Kolodinsky, Diane Bahrenburg, Jill Badolato, Michael Lemnah and the tremendous team at Vermont Wellness Medicine and Integrative Oncology (Dr. Fresh), and the wonderful care team at UVM Oncology (Dr. Kahn) and UVM Hospice and Dr. Haddad at Dana-Farber.
At Stephanie’s request there will be no formal services at this time, she asked for a springtime memorial service. In the meantime to honor Stephanie, please remember to laugh today, be kind, and be peace. If you wish to make a contribution in Stephanie’s honor, please consider donating to:  the International Campaign for Tibet, The Flynn Theater, the Green Mountain Club and Vermont Public. When doing so please note “Memorial donation for Stephanie J. Mapes.”

But even as the state’s housing crisis grinds on, the polarizing pitch seems to be facing an increasingly uphill climb. 
Real estate transfer fees, a long-bubbling idea on Beacon Hill, would impose a surcharge on property sales to generate local revenue that can be directed toward building affordable housing. A proposal filed by Gov. Maura Healey during the last legislative cycle would have allowed cities and towns to impose a 0.5 to 2 percent fee on property sale proceeds over $1 million, or the county’s median home sales price, whichever is greater.  
Healey’s provision failed to advance in the final housing bond bill, and the governor has not signaled eagerness to revisit the policy this session. Supporters nonetheless are vowing to make another push for transfer fees in the coming final year of the two-year legislative session.  
Roughly a dozen different versions of transfer fee legislation have been filed. Sen. Julian Cyr, the Senate co-chair of the Legislature’s housing committee, supports the idea.  
Transfer fees are not “a silver bullet” solution to the housing crisis, he said, but could be a valuable part of the answer if coupled with zoning and permitting changes. Without new streams of revenue to support affordable housing, Cyr said, “there’s no way Massachusetts can subsidize its way out of this crisis.”  
Cyr, a Democrat who represents Cape Cod, Martha’s Vineyard, and Nantucket, has been tasked by Senate President Karen Spilka with “going bold” on housing solutions that can make a dent in the 222,000 new housing units the state projects will be needed in the next decade. On transfer fees, he noted, “my feelings on this are no secret,” and placing him in the top housing spot signals Senate leadership may be warmer to the idea than it was last cycle. 
It seemed political momentum was building last session, but support from the governor, the mayor of the state’s largest city, and initial enthusiasm from the state Senate weren’t enough to get a transfer fee on the books. Facing antipathy from the House and pushback from business leaders, the Senate passed its version of a housing bond bill in 2023 without including a transfer fee provision.  
That decision meant a transfer fee couldn’t be used as a chit during negotiations between chambers, and it effectively killed any prospects for the proposal during the 2023-24 term.   
The transfer fee proposals take two forms: home rule petitions from individual communities seeking permission to impose a surcharge and local option bills providing a blanket authorization for cities and towns to approve transfer fees at the local level.  
Cyr said his district is facing “the worst housing crisis in the state,” and more than half of the 13 home rule petitions to impose a transfer fee have been sent to Beacon Hill by communities on Cape Cod and Nantucket.   
Lawmakers are considering home rule petitions for local real estate transfer fees from Arlington, Boston, Brookline, Cambridge, Concord, Chatham, Eastham, Falmouth, Nantucket, Provincetown, Somerville, Truro, and Wellfleet.   
One of the local option bills, filed by Cyr, takes special note of seasonal communities — where a large proportion of the housing is stock tied up in part-time use, like the Cape and Islands – and their affordability challenges.  The bill would allow seasonal communities in the state to assess a 1 to 2 percent fee on real estate transactions over $1 million, directing the money toward housing.  
Lawmakers representing seasonal communities have floated the idea of a targeted transfer fee policy for those areas, which Cyr says are “speaking with one voice” about their desire for more housing options including the transfer fee. Cape officials, Nantucket real estate agents, and Cape Cod business organizations alike are backing the fees, he said, while other areas of Massachusetts like Boston see the mayor and real estate groups at odds.  
A local option bill largely mirroring the governor’s prior pitch, filed in the Senate by Sen. Joanne Comerford of Northampton and in the House by Reps. Mike Connolly of Cambridge and Carmine Gentile of Sudbury, has support from statewide housing organizations like the Citizens’ Housing & Planning Association (CHAPA) and left-wing organizations like Progressive Mass. Over the past few sessions, a coalition of organizations from cities and towns across the state has also backed some version of a transfer fee.   
There is no sign, however, of a change of heart from House Speaker Ron Mariano, who was chilly toward the idea last term.   
One key Senate leader has also staked out opposition to transfer fees in the past. Sen. Will Brownsberger of Belmont, the third ranking member of the chamber, wrote after the Senate opted against including the fee in the 2023 bond bill that he’s concerned that a transfer fee could stifle efforts to have more housing built. 
“In the long run, the only positive solution to excessive housing costs is the production of more housing,” Brownsberger wrote. “I am uncomfortable with any measure that could tend to drag down housing production in our state. The option for municipalities to impose a transfer tax falls in that category.”  
Healey, who is heading into a reelection campaign where affordability is likely to be front and center, also has pulled back from her earlier enthusiastic push for a transfer fee.  
The fee was nowhere to be found in a sprawling 2025 report on “unlocking housing” in Massachusetts from a Healey task force that included housing policy experts, civic leaders, local officials, and labor representatives.  
The administration on Thursday referred to a brief comment in its statewide housing plan – A Home for Everyone – which notes Healey’s failed effort last session to have a transfer fee approved. “While this proposal was not adopted by the legislature,” the administration “intends to continue working with localities, housing trusts, and the real estate community to create new revenue options for municipalities and regions.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Ptown.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-15 10:00:05.179225

(Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Legislators got their first look at Gov. Laura Kelly’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2027 on Wednesday, finding a plan that prioritizes funding for schools and special education, expanded mental health services and creating a 10-year water plan.
Budget director and administration secretary Adam Proffitt presented the spending blueprint virtually at the joint meeting of the Senate and House budget committees.
The governor’s budget was set after Kelly completed a statewide tour to hear from Kansans, Proffitt said.
“Last fall, I spoke directly with Kansans, who were clear about the priorities they wanted reflected in my budget: fully funded public schools, investments in health care, and action to address our water challenges,” Kelly said in a news release. “My budget delivers on Kansans’ wishes while remaining balanced and ensuring that we protect Kansas’ fiscal foundation.”
The governor’s budget used a projected 1.7% revenue growth for the upcoming fiscal year, which begins July 1, as a basis, Proffitt said. The recommended budget total of $10.8 billion comes in 1.6% higher than last fiscal year’s approved budget, he said.
Proffitt said $35 million of the increase comes from one-time expenditures, and if those expenditures are removed, the budget increase would be 1.3%, the amount total tax collections are expected to grow during the upcoming fiscal year. 
Diving into budget details, Proffitt said a few spending increases are tied to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which shifted some costs to the states. For instance, the state will pay a higher portion of administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which the governor accounted for by including $21 million in the budget, he said.
Legislators at the hearing questioned whether the budget included paying a penalty for the state’s high SNAP error rate, which could be between $20-40 million, depending on the rate, but Proffitt said the penalty won’t be assessed until fiscal year 2028. 
That gives the state time to get the error rate below 6%, which would carry no penalty, he said.
The error rate measures mistakes that have been made in allocating dollars for recipients, and can include data entry mistakes and incorrect calculations. The federal goal is a rate below 6%.  Kansas had a 9% rate for 2025.
The federal law also had more stringent work requirements for SNAP recipients, which increased administrative costs at the state level an estimated $4 million, Proffitt said.
 
 Education

Kelly recommended full funding for K-12 general education for two full years, Proffitt said, which provides predictability to school districts.
The school funding formula sunsets at the end of fiscal year 2027, and Proffitt said the governor’s budget extends the current school finance formula into 2028.
The governor recommended spending $2.5 million to eliminate the co-pay for 34,000 students who receive reduced lunches.
“The governor is recommending an incremental $50.6 million of (State General Fund) to fund special education for fiscal year 2027,” Proffitt said, adding that is 70% of excess costs, which is still well below the 92% required in statute.
The state has not funded special education to the 92% level in 15 years, he said.
“Funding for special education is really a shared responsibility between the federal government and the state government,” Proffitt said. “The governor is calling on the feds again to meet their obligation and increase their level of funding here in Kansas for special education. We simply cannot get to 92% without more federal support.”
 
Water funding
“Water remains among the top priorities in the state, not just for the administration but obviously for many in the Legislature,” Proffitt said. “It’s one of the most critical resources we have in the state, and we know we have a tall order ahead of us to make sure it’s available for the next several generations.”
The governor’s budget recommends full funding at $8 million for the state water plan fund, and Kelly wants to work with the Legislature to develop a long-term water roadmap, Proffitt said. 
 
Human services
Kelly asked for $12.6 million to fully fund a new Community Support waiver, which is expected to eliminate some of the stress from the current intellectual and developmental disability waiver, Proffitt said.
In addition, Kelly’s budget outlines an additional $10 million to address increased demand on the technology assistance waiver, which helps individuals younger than 21 who need life-sustaining medical equipment and technology.
Kelly’s budget includes $15 million to support increased Children’s Health Insurance Program caseloads. Her budget includes dollars for contract nursing at Larned State Hospital and Osawatomie State Hospital, about $37 million for both.
The state hospital system has been scrutinized closely over the past couple of years, Proffitt said, and the governor recommends a budget allocation of $38.9 million to strengthen the system.
“We recognize that there is both a capacity issue across the state hospital system but also staffing issues,” Proffitt said.
He said the budget includes: 

Nearly $31 million that would fund the new South Central Regional Mental Health Hospital, which would get the facility open in fiscal year 2027 and add 103 beds to the state’s capacity.
$3 million in capital improvements at the Kansas Neurological Institute in Topeka to create 15-30 behavioral health beds for children.
$5 million for one-time funding to support six local hospitals with behavioral health beds.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The developers of the proposed Donlin Gold mine in Southwest Alaska are planning to decide next year whether the project’s finances pencil out.
That timeline could depend in part on state utility regulators: At the moment, Alaska doesn’t have rules for the kind of gas pipeline needed to power the mine. 
Developers are proposing a contract-carrier gas line, a change from the usual practice in Alaska. Here, pipelines — including the trans-Alaska oil pipeline — have tended to be common carriers, with shippers able to buy capacity as needed.
A contract carrier sells long-term deals for reserved capacity in a pipeline, regardless of whether or not that space is used.
Though lawmakers have approved rules to govern contract carrier gas pipelines, which would reserve space for long-term use, the state’s regulators haven’t adopted those regulations yet.
“This is the ask,” said Donlin Gold permitting manager Enric Fernandez in a Tuesday meeting of the Regulatory Commission of Alaska. 
“We’re asking the RCA to please proceed with adopting these regulations,” he said.
Donlin’s plans include a natural gas pipeline stretching 316 miles from Anchorage’s Beluga power plant on Cook Inlet to the mine site near the Kuskokwim River. 
Based on a 2002 feasibility study that was updated in 2020, “we’re looking about $1.8 (billion) or $2 billion” for the cost of the pipeline, Fernandez said, but that figure is being updated as part of a “bankable feasibility study” that would compile financial information for potential investors.
That study is expected to be done in 2027.
If the study pans out, construction could begin later that year and finish by 2031.
But in order for that cost study to be complete, Donlin Gold first needs to know what the state’s rules are for contract-carrier gas pipelines.
In 2013, the Alaska Legislature and then-Gov. Sean Parnell approved a law allowing contract-carrier gas pipelines. 
That law was to be implemented by the RCA, but new regulations were never adopted. 
Fernandez said that, as currently planned, the pipeline will be larger than what’s needed for the mine alone, and that gas could be sold to local communities as well.
“It could transfer natural gas for others’ needs,” Fernandez said.
Donlin’s developers signed a letter of intent last week with Glenfarne, the lead developer of the proposed trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline, but Fernandez said that Donlin is open to sourcing gas from other sources, including imports.
“There’s a number of options that are being proposed for Southcentral Alaska right now to bring natural gas … and we just see ourselves as part of the solution,” Fernandez said. “If there is a need to import natural gas, we can be part of that order, hopefully resulting in a larger order. That means maybe better economics there.”

David Gregory, R-Chesterfield, is introduced to the Missouri Senate on the first day of the 2025 legislative session  (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri lawmakers debated two bills this week that would align the state with the federal limits on intoxicating hemp products set to go into effect in November.
Both Missouri bills would prohibit hemp products from containing more than 0.4 milligrams of THC per container, which is among the limits included in a provision in the federal spending bill Congress approved last year.
They both would regulate intoxicating hemp the same as marijuana, which would essentially ban current hemp products because marijuana must be grown in Missouri and most hemp is grown outside of the state. They would also require hemp products to be sold in licensed cannabis dispensaries, where most are currently sold in gas stations, liquor stores, restaurants and smoke shops. 
State officials estimated in 2024 that 40,000 food establishments and smoke shops and 1,800 food manufacturers were selling products that would be banned under the proposed federal regulations. It includes low-dose THC seltzers, such as Mighty Kind and Triple, that have increased in popularity at liquor stores and bars. 
While business owners selling these products oppose the federal ban, some said they’re putting their support behind a proposal by Republican state Rep. Dave Hinman of O’Fallon because it would allow Missouri to sell the products if Congress changes its mind in the future. 
A House committee discussed Hinman’s legislation Tuesday, making it one of the first bills to get a public hearing during the new legislative session that began last week.
“The bottom line for us is, if it’s authorized and it’s lawful under federal law, we should be able to sell it here in Missouri, just like all the other 49 states will be able to sell it,” said Ron Leon, executive director of the Missouri Petroleum and Convenience Association, which represents gas stations and convenience stores, during the hearing Tuesday evening. 
The other bill, proposed by Republican state Sen. David Gregory of Chesterfield, does not include this provision. Another difference in Gregory’s bill is that it includes an emergency clause, meaning it would be enacted as soon as lawmakers approve it and the governor signs it.
New federal regulations complicate Missouri debate over intoxicating hemp

“Now it’s time for us to ensure the safety of our kids, regardless of what Congress did or will be doing in the future,” Gregory said during the Senate committee hearing Wednesday morning. “And we need to prohibit intoxicating cannabis from being sold anywhere except for the way our voters designed it and requested it be sold. And that’s exactly what this bill seeks to do.”
The Missouri Cannabis Trade Association, which represents marijuana businesses, has put its support behind both bills. The Missouri Hemp Trade Association, which represents a number of hemp businesses, spoke in opposition to Gregory’s bill but was neutral on Hinman’s bill. 
This will be the fourth year in a row that Missouri lawmakers have attempted to regulate intoxicating hemp products, with previous debates ending in stalemates. 
However, Hinman said this is a priority for the state’s leadership. 
“I met with [Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway] last week, and she thinks this needs to be a priority,” Hinman told The Independent. “I believe the governor is the same and the speaker (of the House) is the same, so I think it’s going to move pretty quick.”
The Law Enforcement Legislative Coalition, which represents police chiefs across Missouri, is supporting both bills. Lake Saint Louis Police Department Chief Chris DiGiuseppi emphasized at both the Senate and House committee hearings this week that the federal provision does not give local police authority to enforce the ban, which is why the state bills are necessary.
“In order to enforce federal law, we’d have to go to a federal law enforcement agency,” DiGiuseppi told the state Senate committee members Wednesday. “We would have to get others involved. We can only enforce state statute. That’s what we’re empowered to do.”
State Sen. Nick Schroer, a Republican from Defiance, asked DiGiuseppi how difficult it would be to enforce the federal ban if Missouri lawmakers fail to pass regulations again this year.  
“It would be much more difficult,” DiGiuseppi said. “It’s always easier to try to take care of that in house…so we appreciate all the help we can get.”
Kathi Harness, a lobbyist for the Missouri Beer Wholesalers Association, opposed both bills during hearings this week. She argued that state lawmakers should consider conversations that are happening at the national level. 
Earlier this week, a U.S. House bill was filed to delay the implementation of the federal ban until 2028.
The association is supporting separate legislation to allow the sale of intoxicating hemp beverages to continue, contingent on what happens at the federal level.
“I believe, as do many people,… that what they will do is they will give it back to the states to regulate,” Harness said. “The federal government doesn’t regulate alcohol at the federal level. Alcohol is regulated at the state level, and I think there’s a very good chance that that’s how it will go if, in fact, the federal government decides to allow this product.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010825_davidgregory1-1024x723.jpg,,,2026-01-15 10:00:05.179225

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A survey of the 2026 campaign for Kansas governor shows a majority of Democratic voters unable to choose between frontrunners Sen. Cindy Holscher and Sen. Ethan Corson if the election was held in January rather than in August.
In the survey’s hypothetical head-to-head showdown measured by Public Policy Polling, 58% of 699 participants couldn’t decide who they would vote for at this point. More than seven months of statewide campaigning remain until the Aug. 4 primary to select a Democratic Party nominee to take on winner of the Republican Party primary race.
The poll, which was sponsored by the Holscher campaign, revealed that among individuals who felt they had sufficient information to declare a preference, 33% were comfortable with Holscher and 9% were drawn to Corson. Both Democratic candidates represent a Johnson County district in the state Senate.
Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, said it was telling that 68% were unable to form a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Holscher and 79% couldn’t decide the same questions for Corson. Neither candidate has spent significantly on campaign advertising.
“Obviously, this far out of this race with two candidates who are not known statewide the poll is showing ‘don’t know them’ as the leader,” Beatty said. “Holscher is slightly more well known — although still close to 70% don’t know her — and leading among that small group of Dems who know them.”
Beatty said the survey could reflect that Holscher participated in two more legislative election cycles than Corson. In addition, he said, Holscher had more time to raise general public awareness for her campaign for governor. She announced her candidacy in June, while Corson entered the contest nearly six weeks later in July.
Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, who is completing the final year of her second term, endorsed Corson’s campaign in November.

Holscher campaign manager Madi Ashcraft said this snapshot was indicative of what backers believed about Holscher.
“Cindy has the support of grassroots Democrats and her message resonates with voters,” Ashcraft said. “While other candidates are catering to out-of-state donors and the establishment, Cindy has everyday Kansans on her side because they know what she stands for.”
In terms of campaign donations during 2025, Corson’s finance report said he generated $902,600 compared with Holscher’s $397,900. Corson spent $375,600 from the account during the year, which was significantly more than the $218,000 expended by Holscher. On Dec. 31, Corson reported nearly three times more cash on hand as Holscher.
“Ethan Corson is the only candidate in this race building a broad coalition of support to win both the primary and the general election,” said Kyla Sabado, Corson’s campaign manager. “In 2025, thousands of Kansans chipped in to help us build real statewide momentum. We are proud to be the only campaign in this race endorsed by labor, along with the enthusiastic support of Gov. Laura Kelly.”
For the survey conducted Jan. 8 and 9, the respondents were 62% women, 88% white, 72% were 46 years of age or older, and 48% completed at least a two-year community college degree. The text and landline survey concentrated on Johnson, Sedgwick and Shawnee county media markets.
Given the survey exclusively explored views of Democrats, it came as little surprise 96% of participants disapproved of GOP President Donald Trump.
Holscher received a favorable response from 28% of those surveyed, while 4% had an unfavorable view of her. Seventeen percent of participants had a favorable perception of Corson, but 5% said they had an unfavorable view of him.
Those taking part in the Kansas poll were presented background summaries of both Corson and Holscher. Forty-four percent said they found the description of Holscher “very convincing” in terms of drawing interest in her message. Twenty-nine percent of people said information offered to them about Corson provided  a “very convincing” argument for his candidacy.
For purposes of this poll, respondents were told Holscher was a member of the Senate who “fights for hard-working people and our public schools.” They were informed Holscher was raised on a farm and among the first people in her family to graduate from college.
She helped found the Bipartisan Women’s Caucus in the Legislature and “led the effort” to repeal Gov. Sam Brownback’s aggressive state income tax cuts. Participants in the poll were told Holscher took part in bringing Republicans and Democrats together to restore public school funding as well as grant tax reductions to “regular people instead of corporations and create more jobs in Kansas.”
For the survey, Corson was characterized as a senator and lifelong Kansan who attended Garden City Community College on a baseball scholarship, earned a law degree and worked at the U.S. Department of Commerce under President Barack Obama.
They were told Corson had “a common-sense approach, working with Republicans and Democrats to make our schools stronger, lowering taxes for the working- and middle-class, and recruiting new businesses to Kansas.” The summary  said Corson was endorsed by the governor because he was a “middle-of-the-road candidate who will be laser-focused on kitchen-table issues.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA130806-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-15 10:00:05.179225

“@grok put her in a bikini”
Writing nothing but a short prompt, users on the social media platform X can quickly generate nonconsensual and sexually explicit images of women and children — a disturbing trend that has prompted California to launch a probe into X’s artificial intelligence tool.
As CalMatters’ Khari Johnson explains, California Attorney General Rob Bonta on Wednesday said the state plans to investigate the AI chatbot Grok after reports that a recent update enables users to create and spread sexualized photos of women and children. Tech billionaire Elon Musk’s company xAI developed Grok. 

Bonta, in a statement: “The avalanche of reports … in recent weeks is shocking. This material, which depicts women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations, has been used to harass people across the internet.”

In a Jan. 3 post on X, Musk said that anyone using the AI tool to make illegal content “will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.” Though, in an earlier response to Reuters addressing reports of sexualized images of kids spreading on X, he said that “Legacy Media Lies.”
Since 2019, California has passed about a half a dozen laws protecting people from deepfake pornography. Most recently, it enacted a law that punishes people providing “a service that enables the ongoing operation of deepfake pornography” with a fine of up to $250,000.

Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, a San Ramon Democrat and bill author, in a statement to CalMatters: “Real women are having their images manipulated without consent, and the psychological and reputational harm is devastating. Underage children are having their images used to create child sexual abuse material, and these websites are knowingly facilitating it.”

With the help of Grok — which will also be soon integrated in the Pentagon’s systems — X now produces more non-consensual naked or sexual imagery than any other website online, according to Bloomberg. And while the images may be fake, the damage they inflict is real: In 2024, the FBI warned that the use of deepfake tools to extort young people has led to self harm and suicide.

Judges reject GOP lawsuit with blistering critique


A “No on Prop. 50” sign off Highway 99 in Delano on Sept. 27, 2025. Photo by Larry Valenzuela, CalMatters/CatchLight Local




From CalMatters politics reporter Maya C. Miller:
A panel of three federal court judges shot down the latest “Hail Mary” attempt by California Republicans and President Donald Trump’s administration to halt the use of the new congressional maps voters approved under Proposition 50, saying their “molehill of statements” claiming the maps were racially biased did not make that claim true.
The 2-1 ruling, with one Trump-appointed judge dissenting, comes after the judges heard three days of testimony and reviewed more than 500 exhibits totaling thousands of pages along with audio and video recordings.
“Our conclusion probably seems obvious to anyone who followed the news in the summer and fall of 2025,” wrote Judge Josephine Staton, an Obama appointee, in her scathing rebuke of the GOP’s challenge. 
She noted that opponents of Prop. 50 relied on a completely different argument against the measure in court than they used on the campaign trail.

Staton, in the ruling: “So, Challengers have abandoned the argument they made to the voters. Proposition 50, apparently, is no longer a partisan power grab. Now, it is a ‘racial gerrymander.’”

The GOP said they will seek an injunction from the U.S. Supreme Court. 



Parole rates for prisoners drop


Illustration by Gabriel Hongsdusit, CalMatters




Fewer California prisoners are being found suitable for parole, despite the state expanding opportunities and incentives for incarcerated people to seek parole over the last 10 years, reports CalMatters’ Joe Garcia.
Before plateauing in 2023, the annual number of parole hearings increased over the years, from 5,226 in 2018 to 9,017 in 2022. But the success rate for prisoners to be found suitable for parole has declined, from 39% in 2018 to below 25% in 2025.
Parole experts said various factors could be at play. As California’s prison population ages, the mental and physical limitations of these older incarcerated people could negatively impact their ability to present themselves before a parole board.
More than ever before, parole commissioners also have an abundant amount of personal information on individual prisoners: Visitor logs, personal expenses, medical records and monitored phone calls and text messages can all be deemed relevant when considering parole. The extra scrutiny could reveal potential misconduct, and result in commissioners granting fewer paroles.

But a cemetery preserves Mike's grave and the memories of their childhood together.,"Guest Commentary written by

Joshua Hernandez is an English teacher and academic decathlon coach at St. John Bosco High School in Bellflower.


On a recent trip to the Inglewood Park Cemetery to visit my best friend Mike, I noticed that his tombstone was dirty.I hadn’t come in a while, and apparently no one else had either. As I cleaned up, I surveyed the area around me. At 17, Mike was the youngest interred there by far. Most people buried nearby had at least reached their 40s by the time they died. Many, I realized as I looked at the dates, had been dead now longer than they were alive, their stories tracing back to different points in Inglewood’s past.
Beyond the cemetery, I was confronted by the rapidly gentrifying present of this place that raised Mike and me. Just across the street, where the old Daniel Freeman Hospital once stood, developers erected fancy condos way too expensive for the average Inglewood resident to afford. The skyline is now filled with new landmarks: SoFi Stadium, opened in 2020; the Forum, renamed in 2022, and now painted red, not the blue of my childhood; the Intuit Dome, the most recent addition, opened in 2024. 
The Inglewood that Mike and I knew has been constructed over. But the cemetery preserves the neighborhood’s complete narrative. I made sure to wipe the rest of the dirt off Mike’s tombstone before leaving because I wanted to be sure that his life is remembered in its telling.
From foe to friend
The way I met Mike sounds like a shitty Netflix comedy. We both attended Beulah Payne Elementary School at 215 W. 94th Street. I was in first grade and he was in second. I can’t remember the specifics of the encounter, but I know that it ended in one of those petty schoolyard scraps.
Flash forward three years to when my parents decided to send me to private school to keep me out of trouble. St. John Chrysostom was less than two miles from Beulah Payne but it felt like another universe, one where I was convinced I wouldn’t fit in. Except on my first day I recognized a familiar face. There was Mike, with his tan brown skin and small widow’s peak.

It turned out Mike had been sent to St. John in hopes it would keep him out of trouble too. This time around, instead of fighting, we bonded over being two Mexican kids from the inner city, different from our private school classmates, mostly Black and Filipino, who we didn’t think knew a day of “the struggle.”
If I was more reserved and prone to internalizing, Mike wore his heart on his sleeve and was always willing to go toe-to-toe with anyone on the schoolyard. Yin and yang, we balanced each other out. Mike quickly became more like a brother than a friend. It feels funny to say that our inner children came out when we saw each other, as we were both so young back then. But neither of us had enjoyed many opportunities to just be a kid. I always said my childhood ended at 9, when my brother was diagnosed with leukemia. Mike had to grow up even faster. His mother, who had health problems, died when he was around 7. As long as I knew him, his dad was away in prison. Since Mike’s parents were out of the picture, we used to hang out at my place, play video games, and just be.
On different paths
Looking back, it’s easy to see why our lives diverged. Because my dad got caught up in gang life when he was young, he and my mom, both born and raised in Inglewood, were careful to encourage me and my siblings to go another route. Mike didn’t have those kinds of role models in his life.
The summer of seventh grade, Mike left St. John and joined a gang—and I made the painful decision to distance myself from him. Since my brother had gotten sick, I had stopped causing trouble. I wanted to show up for my family. I also knew that if I wanted to make something of myself, I had to stay out of that life. Mike understood my reasons and took them in stride. One thing about Mike: He always protected me.
The last time I saw Mike was at the St. John fall carnival in 2019. We didn’t talk about the fact that we didn’t see each other as much anymore; we already knew why it had to be that way. Underneath everything, we knew there was always only love.
More than a statistic
Mike died that spring, after being shot near Century Boulevard and South Freeman Avenue.
I teach high school kids now, and I’m acutely aware that what happened to Mike is an unfortunate reality for many young men like him, who grew up in similar circumstances in Inglewood or elsewhere. These kids matter, but they rarely get the attention kids from more well-off backgrounds get. If you do a search online, the only coverage of Mike’s death is one sentence in the Los Angeles Times’ Homicide Report.
Mike was more than a statistic, more than a victim of homicide in an inner city. He was my friend and my brother. When I go to visit him at the Inglewood Park Cemetery, I am reminded of the good times we had together. And I find comfort knowing that in this place, inhabited by the dead but filled with memories, with pain, with the essence of life in this city, Mike remains a permanent part of Inglewood’s story.

Miller and Jeanne Kuang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2026/01/billionaires-tax-health-funding/,Newsom has already vowed to tank a proposed ballot initiative that would impose a 5% wealth tax on the state’s billionaires to bolster Medi-Cal.

Newsom has already vowed to tank a proposed ballot initiative that would impose a 5% wealth tax on the state’s billionaires to bolster Medi-Cal. Progressive lawmakers and their allies in labor and health seem hopeful that Newsom could support a different long-shot funding idea.


California health care advocates, labor unions and progressive lawmakers are urging the governor and the Legislature to find new money to fund medical care and other social services for millions of low-income and disabled Californians. 
Their coalition, known as “Fight for Our Health,” demanded Wednesday on the Capitol steps that the Legislature and soon-to-be lame duck Gov. Gavin Newsom take action to backfill funding cuts that President Donald Trump and Republicans approved last year.
The dilemma over how to respond to billions of dollars in cuts to social services — particularly to the budget for Medi-Cal, the state’s nearly $200 billion Medicaid program — foreshadows a showdown that will dominate both the 2026 legislative session and the midterm elections. 
As one union pursues a controversial wealth tax ballot measure to offset the cuts, progressive Democrats in the Legislature are floating a separate corporate tax, though details remain scant. If that materializes into a bill, it’s also likely to divide the party, which is sensitive to accusations that Californians are over-taxed and has recently declared its leaders will focus on lowering costs for state residents. 
In his final year as governor, Newsom faces a tug-of-war between two politically radioactive options: increasing taxes, or letting benefits lapse for millions of low-income and disabled Californians. Though his administration has sought only to blame Trump for the federal cuts, health care advocates made it clear they will push Newsom to help prevent steep coverage losses.
“I want to take a moment to address the governor and the state Legislature,” said Judy Mark, president of Disability Voices United, from the Capitol steps. “We know that you are not responsible for these awful cuts, but now the responsibility does lie in your hands. You have the power to protect us.”
The governor angered health advocates when he didn’t include money to backfill coverage when he released his state budget proposal, which acknowledges that tens of thousands will lose coverage and counts fewer services among projected revenue savings. This year, the state began freezing new Medi-Cal enrollment for undocumented immigrant adults over rising costs in the program, over the objections of progressives and health advocates. 
Newsom’s analysts expect about 522,000 Californians to lose Medi-Cal coverage in the 2026-2027 fiscal year, rising in the future to 1.8 million. His administration has said the state simply doesn’t have the money to pay for coverage for people who are booted off the program due to new federal laws. 
One union, the Service Employees International Union–United Healthcare Workers West, has proposed a ballot initiative that would impose a wealth tax on California billionaires to help cover the roughly $30 billion the state would lose annually from Trump’s tax-and-spending law. Proponents say the one-time 5% levy would generate about $100 billion for the state’s health care system. About 10% of the money raised would be reserved for public schools.
But Newsom is fighting the measure, which has yet to qualify for the ballot but has still sent Sacramento and Silicon Valley into a tizzy.

Billionaires critical to state budget
The proposal has set off a flurry of opposition. Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have reportedly moved to shift some business entities out of California while others are threatening to leave. Democratic strategists close to Newsom are running a campaign committee to defeat the measure as the union collects the nearly 900,000 signatures needed to qualify it for the November ballot. 
Newsom, who has repeatedly opposed state wealth tax proposals, this week told Politico he’s been personally pushing the measure’s proponents to drop it over concerns it could drive the targeted demographic — and their incomes — out of California. He also has longstanding personal ties to many of the tech titans who would likely be subject to a proposed wealth tax, and has reason to keep them close: they are potential donors should he make an expected presidential run after finishing up his term as governor this year. 
Even as progressives push Newsom to raise revenue to bolster Medi-Cal, few of them have actually embraced the wealth tax proposal, with most of them taking a wait-and-see stance. They also won’t criticize Newsom’s opposition, a potential sign that liberal lawmakers are hoping he’ll be willing to pursue other funding for health care.
Newsom’s office did not respond to inquiries Wednesday about whether he would consider alternative tax proposals.
The health advocates said they would make replacing federal funding a key priority this legislative session. Progressive lawmakers, who led the charge against Newsom’s proposal to cut costs by freezing Medi-Cal for undocumented immigrants, have signaled they’ll take up the fight as well. 
Assembly Health Chair Mia Bonta, an Oakland Democrat, suggested the state look at imposing new taxes on corporations that employ workers who are paid so little they qualify for public health care assistance. 
“We cannot let these corporations keep getting a free ride,” she said. “California has a responsibility to act decisively, and we will.”
But she has not introduced a bill, and health care advocates said they’re still just hoping to have more options on the table.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01142026_-FightForOurHealthCoalition_RA_CM_05.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-15 08:56:36.231608

Gavin Newsom included no new funding for local journalism in his budget proposal last week, walking back an August 2024 deal with Google to commit $175 million over five years to help the diminishing industry.","In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom included no new funding for local journalism in his budget proposal last week, walking back an August 2024 deal with Google to commit $175 million over five years to help the diminishing industry. 


Gov. Gavin Newsom’s budget proposal includes no money for a fund formed last year to boost the state’s local newsrooms, casting doubt on whether a heralded effort to help California journalists will amount to anything and how serious Newsom is about supporting the struggling industry.
It’s a significant walkback from an August 2024 deal between state leaders and Google in which they agreed to jointly spend $175 million over five years to fund local journalism.
The deal, which Newsom hailed as a “major breakthrough in ensuring the survival of newsrooms” at the time, was reached after Google spent a record sum — $11 million — lobbying state lawmakers successfully to drop two proposals that would have forced Google to pay newsrooms for using their content. Under the agreement, the state would pay $70 million and Google $55 million into the newly established California Civic Media Fund for local news outlets. Google would also continue issuing its annual $10 million newsroom grants. 
But in May 2025, citing budget restraints, Newsom slashed the state’s first-year commitment to just $10 million for fiscal year 2025-26, with no future state funding guaranteed. Google subsequently said it would match the state’s $10 million investment but no more.
Google was clear in the deal that “its contributions were contingent” on state funding, similar to its journalism funding deal in Canada, said Erin Ivie, spokesperson for Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, an Oakland Democrat who brokered the deal in 2024.
A 2019 study by the trade group News Media Alliance estimated that Google made $4.7 billion from news sites in 2018. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, made over $100 billion in the third quarter of 2025 alone — its “first ever $100 billion quarter,” said Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. By Wednesday, Alphabet’s market cap was over $4 trillion.
None of the $20 million pledged has reached local news outlets, drawing disappointment from journalism advocates. 

Newsom is ‘more interested in the billionaires and his friends than he’s interested in journalists who are out on the street.’California News Publishers Association President Chuck Champion

“At this point right now, nobody should be jumping up and down and getting excited,” California News Publishers Association President Chuck Champion said.
Newsom’s lack of proposed funding for future years angered Champion, who said the governor failed to keep his promise.
“He’s more interested in the billionaires and his friends than he’s interested in journalists who are out on the street,” Champion said. “He talks about democracy, he talks about how critically important it is, and then he allows our journalists to starve on the vine.”
The lack of future commitment from the state also raises the question whether Google will deposit anything into the fund next year. Google News Initiative did not immediately respond to a CalMatters inquiry for comment.
Newsom’s office did not respond to questions about his decision to skip the funding this year, directing CalMatters to the state Department of Finance and the California Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development, which administers the funds. 
Lawmaker promises to fight for more funding
“There’s no going back on the deal,” Department of Finance Director Joe Stephenshaw stressed to reporters during a budget briefing last week, saying that the state has already contributed the $10 million promised last year. 
Wicks said budget restraints forced Newsom’s hand last year. 
“What you saw last year was the budget being what it was,” she said. “Programs across the board got cut and sliced, either got completely zeroed out or significantly reduced, and this is no different.”
But she said she will fight for more funding. 
“I’ve been operating on the assumption that (the state) will honor the multiyear commitment,” Wicks said.
But even the full amount of the Google deal may not be enough to “arrest the collapse of independent community news in California,” said former state Sen. Steve Glazer, an Orinda Democrat who authored a bill that would have offered tax credits to employers of journalists by charging a fee to platforms like Google.
“Leaders can’t just talk about protecting our democracy,” he said. “They need to act to direct the resources to support independent news reporting that provides the oversight and accountability of our democratic institutions.”
The journalism industry nationwide has been diminishing. Between 2005 and 2024, more than 3,200 newspapers shut their doors, according to a 2024 report by the Local News Initiative at Northwestern University. 
As of that year, California had 1.5 news outlets for every 100,000 residents, ranking 45th among all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Between 2013 and 2024, the number of newspaper journalists in California dropped by more than half. 
To make matters worse, Congress last year voted to strip public broadcast stations nationwide of federal funding, putting dozens of stations across California in peril. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a national nonprofit that has funded public media since 1967, announced its dissolution due to the funding cuts last week.
California’s public broadcasters stand to lose as much as $30 million a year due to the federal cuts, said Assemblymember Chris Ward, a San Diego Democrat, in a letter last month to legislative budget leaders requesting state funding for public media.
Ward, along with 11 other Democratic assemblymembers, is asking for $70 million next year for public broadcast stations. 
“California is one of only 16 states that do not provide funding for public media,” he said in the letter. “California’s 33 non-profit public media organizations provide coverage to over 90% of the state, and serve diverse communities in both (the) largest metropolitan areas and rural communities — services that not only include arts, culture, and community engagement, but emergency alerts and education.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-15 13:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Major NY wind project may die if Trump pause lasts past Friday, developer says",Samantha Maldonado | THE CITY,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/15/major-ny-wind-project-may-die-if-trump-pause-lasts-past-friday-developer-says/,Work on Empire Wind has been on hold since the Trump administration “paused” the leases on it and four other projects just days before Christmas.,"An offshore wind project that would bring renewable power to over half a million New York City homes could be dead in the water.
Work on Empire Wind, an in-progress project developed by the company Equinor, has been on hold since the Trump administration “paused” the leases for it — and four other projects, including Sunrise Wind in New York — just days before Christmas.
Because of that pause, no work in federal waters can happen right now. And Molly Morris, president of Equinor Renewables America, said the project would likely face cancellation if construction could not resume by Friday.
That’s because a special vessel used for lifting very heavy equipment can only be at the project site, about 15 miles off the coast of Long Island, until February. Then it won’t be available for another year. If that timeline is thrown off, “cascading delays” would jeopardize the project.
“It’s critical that those activities are able to continue for vessel availability that we have and specifically being able to install the offshore substation, which is a very critical piece of equipment,” Morris said. “Our time of being able to do that is very limited.”
Equinor took to court to request a preliminary injunction, but the federal judge who heard the case Wednesday did not make a ruling. The judge will issue an order on Thursday. Meanwhile, hundreds of workers remain in limbo, waiting to start jobs at sea.
One of those workers is electrician Sally McKleinfeld, who lives in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. A member of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 3, McKleinfeld underwent special training to be able to work on Empire Wind, but can’t get a deployment date because of the work stoppage.
“It’s extremely frustrating,” she said. “Our job is risky on a good day. There’s environmental risk and our particular trade is very dangerous. When you couple that with the danger of being at sea, it’s an exceptional little pool of people who are excited — not just excited but thrilled — to do this … I’m willing to walk away from my kids, go on a boat and make the future happen.”
Union electrician Sally McKleinfeld, who has a keychain of a wind turbine, was slated to work on the project off the shore of Long Island.
The job would require McKleinfeld, 48, to live on a ship for three weeks, away from her husband and two children. But without a date, the family can’t prepare for her absence.
John Blanchfield, a rigger and member of the Dock Builders Union Local 1565, was scheduled to go back out to sea on Monday to continue working on Empire Wind. He’d lived on a ship for several weeks at a time between last summer and the end of the year to assist with lifting the equipment and he loved the work, enough to center the rest of his career around offshore wind.
“The uncertainty for the future is there now. Am I gonna continue in the offshore program?” he said. “When you have this opportunity in front of you and it’s taken away for no reason, it’s quite disturbing.”
At home in New Jersey without pay, the 47-year-old has turned down other job offers, anticipating he’d go back to sea. 
“Now I’m sitting here like, should I have said yes?” Blanchfield said.
He was supposed to be mobilized to the heavy-lifting vessel that’s only available to Equinor until February — and he still hopes it happens. He enjoyed being out on the water, witnessing scenes that he said inspired “awe.”
Dock Builders union member John Blanchfield was slated to work on a wind energy project off the shore of Long Island.
“It’s hard to describe: the 300-foot monopiles get lifted into the air like it’s nothing,” Blanchfield said, referring to the massive tubes that serve as the turbine’s foundation. “The sheer scope of it becomes incredibly breathtaking.”
Flat Air
Empire Wind is not the only New York offshore wind project affected by the Trump administration’s stop-work order: Sunrise Wind, developed by Orsted, was also caught in the crosshairs. Three additional projects serving other East Coast states were paused, too. 
The Department of the Interior had cited unspecified national security risks in its order.
Both Orsted and Equinor — as well as New York Attorney General Letitia James — took to court earlier this month to challenge the lease suspensions. On Monday, Danish developer Orsted won a preliminary injunction for a project it’s working on to serve Connecticut and Rhode Island, allowing construction to continue — though the time frame for the Sunrise Wind court case remains unclear.
“New Yorkers deserve clean, reliable energy, good-paying jobs, and a government that follows the law,” James said in a statement. “These projects were carefully reviewed and already under construction when the federal government pulled the plug without explanation. This reckless decision puts workers, families, and our climate goals at risk.”
Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind are projected to generate enough power for about a million homes when they are in operation, targeted for 2027. The power from the wind projects is especially important for New York City, as the electricity grid could face reliability challenges in the coming years.
Sunrise Wind is almost halfway to completion. Each day the project is delayed costs $1 million, and the full cancellation of the project could result in losses of over $8 billion, according to a court filing.
Empire Wind is 60% complete, and Equinor has spent more than $4 billion on the project, the company disclosed in a court filing. 
Equinor is also developing the city-owned South Brooklyn Marine Terminal, a port in Sunset Park that would support Empire Wind’s operations and maintenance. The terminal, at 90% completion, is also where the power from the wind project out in the ocean connects to the New York City grid.
Equinor said that if the Empire Wind does not move forward, the terminal’s future is in the air — though the company has been looking for other users to lease the space for activities not related to wind.
McKleinfeld, the electrician, has been working on site at the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal. But as the project wraps up, she’s looking forward to working on the wind farm itself. 
She has a silver keychain etched with a wind turbine that she holds on to as a sign of hope that she can live out the adventure she’s trained for.
“Once the turbines are erected, I would love to be the one up in the nacelle, the head of the wind turbine behind the propellers,” McKleinfeld said. “To me, that is so cool. You’re on top of the world and you’re doing what you’re trained to do.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26013809809106-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 10:57:59.434321
,California,2026-01-15 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Homelessness crisis remains one of Newsom’s biggest political liabilities,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2026/01/homelessness-crisis-newsom-political-liabilities/,"Newsom recently boasted about a 9% drop in homelessness, yet there are still plenty of encampments critics could feature in attack ads should he run for president in two years.","While delivering his final State of the State address and proposing his final state budget last week, Gov. Gavin Newsom clearly sought to neutralize an issue that has haunted his political career for more than two decades and could torpedo his hopes of becoming president: homelessness.
First, a bit of history.
Just months after being elected mayor of San Francisco in 2004, Newsom unveiled a plan he said would clear city streets of homeless people in 10 years. Fourteen years later, while running for governor, Newsom declared that homelessness in San Francisco had “never been worse.” 
He said eradicating homelessness would be a high priority and promised to appoint a homeless “czar” who could cut through red tape and intergovernmental friction to get the job done. Later, when pressed by reporters over the czar pledge, he snapped, “You want to know who’s the homeless czar? I’m the homeless czar in the state of California.”
Despite that self-appointment and devoting almost all of his 2020 State of the State address to homelessness, the number of unhoused Californians continued to rise to record levels. As it did, Newsom began blaming local governments for not spending state homelessness grants effectively and threatened to withhold annual funding.
However, in 2024 State Auditor Grant Parks excoriated Newsom’s own California Interagency Council on Homelessness for failing to effectively monitor and coordinate homelessness programs — even though the state had spent more than $20 billion during Newsom’s governorship.
He later reorganized the council and last year it issued a glossy “Action Plan for Preventing and Ending Homelessness.” Newsom hailed it as “not just a report of our investments, but a directive for continued accountability and action towards specific quantifiable goals.”
It listed multiple things that should be done to alleviate the homelessness crisis, but never mentioned how its lofty goals should be achieved nor said anything about how the state’s deficit-ridden budget would pay for them.
In last week’s State of the State address, Newsom sang the political version of the World War II tune, “Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive,” cataloguing his accomplishments during the last seven years, including progress toward eliminating homelessness.
“When I began as governor, there was no homeless plan, no mental health plan and certainly no housing plan,” Newsom told legislators. “There was no accountability and little investment. The responsibility fell to cities and counties, with little interest from Sacramento.”
Newsom ticked off the efforts he had made and bragged that, “Early data, just compiled, shows that the number of unsheltered homeless people in California dropped 9% in 2025,” while “the nation saw an 18.1% overall increase in homelessness. Our investments are paying off.”
He could not, however, resist another jab at local officials, saying he is “providing counties what they’ve been asking for: the predictable funding for housing and substance abuse treatment. No more excuses — it’s time to bring people off the streets, out of encampments, into housing, into treatment. Counties need to do their job.”
County officials took umbrage. The California State Association of Counties, in a statement, complained that Newsom’s budget shifts the financial burden for several health and welfare programs to county governments and fails to protect them from federal reductions.
The organization also cited the new budget’s omission of an annual bloc grant for homeless programs, and the administration’s stalling the delivery of cash from a past allocation, “which was approved by the Legislature 18 months ago.”
While Newsom cites a 9% drop in homelessness, if true it would be from a base of nearly 200,000 Californians without homes. There are still plenty of squalid encampments to be videotaped and featured on ads attacking a potential presidential candidate named Newsom two years hence.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/102524_Unhoused-Voting_FG_CM_12.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-15 08:56:36.231608

A year after Eaton Fire, some business owners aim to return or go on while also dealing with rebuilding their homes.


A year after the Eaton Fire, some small business owners in Altadena are striving to rebuild, in some cases while also grappling with being displaced from homes that burned down or were severely damaged. 
For others, such as Steve’s Pets Store owner Carrie Meyers, it’s just too much.
“People want me back,” Meyers said. “But I don’t know if we can survive up there. No one lives there … mentally I’m not there.”
Meyers said she had just received a delivery before the fire last January, so about 65 animals perished, including cats, rats, birds and a 40-year-old parrot. The store is now permanently closed, and its website shows a message from former employee Michael Mersola, who said he would miss it because “people would just (hang out) here, I swear it was Starbucks for animal lovers lol.”
Meanwhile, Carrie’s husband Ed is dealing with trying to rebuild their home, which burned down. He has dealt with a long insurance process with State Farm that has, four claims adjusters later, finally improved.
One adjuster “was the king of no” and “existed like a great cloud in our lives for four to five months,” Ed Meyers said. “Then one day, like winning the lottery, we got a new adjuster.” 
Other survivors of the fire that killed 19 people have complained about insurance companies assigning them multiple adjusters, slowing things down. Now, Ed said things are looking better than they were six months ago and they are on their way to rebuilding, though they were underinsured, something many fire survivors have in common.
The small business owners and others CalMatters spoke with for this story stressed the importance of thoughtful and timely help from insurance companies, community organizations and all levels of government for businesses and residents as key to the recovery of the unincorporated town of about 43,000 residents — even for the businesses that survived the fire. 
“Our struggling businesses can’t afford patience,” said Nic Arnzen, chief of the Altadena Town Council, who called the community’s path to recovery a chicken-and-egg situation. “Without the population returning to Altadena, they’re in a tough corner.”
Los Angeles County has received about 2,700 applications for permits to rebuild in Altadena, according to the county’s dashboard. Of those, the county has issued about 1,200 permits and 560 homes are being rebuilt right now. 
‘The heart of Altadena’
Jimmy Orlandini, owner of Altadena Hardware, thinks it might take five years to reopen his business at its original location after almost the whole building burned down.
“Five years is an eternity to not have a business running,” he said. As others rebuild, they will need a hardware store, so he is looking for a temporary place to run his business as he waits for the property owner to rebuild. He had 21 employees at the time of the fire; he thinks most of them have found other jobs, while some are relying on unemployment benefits. 
His family has been in the hardware business for decades, and he has two other locations elsewhere. But he has deep ties to the community, having lived in Altadena for 40 years, since he was 2.

“It’s really difficult,” he said. “Altadena was our best store in terms of revenue, and our relationship with the customer base.” (Another business owner CalMatters spoke with, the owner of a pizza restaurant, called the hardware store “the heart of Altadena.”)
Orlandini and his family returned to their house in October. It did not burn down even as “everything around us burned,” he said. But Mercury Insurance eventually deemed it a total loss because of smoke damage and lead contamination of all its contents. 
“We have no couch,” he said. “We’re sitting on camping chairs in the living room. The kids still haven’t gotten their toys back.” But he said they finally received a big portion of the payout for the contents of their house a couple of weeks ago, so “now we can start buying stuff.”
Uneven help 
A common refrain among Altadena’s small business owners: Some of the help available to homeowners is not extended to them.
Matt Schodorf co-owns Café de Leche with his wife, Anya. Their home, about 15 to 20 minutes away in Highland Park in Los Angeles, is fine except for some ash in the attic. He understands that Altadena homeowners whose homes were destroyed and want to rebuild need assistance — those are his customers. 
But their Altadena coffee shop, the only one whose building they owned out of their four locations and which he said was their busiest store, burned down. Now they’re dealing with the rebuilding process and in some ways are feeling left out. 
“FEMA in particular excluded us from debris removal originally,” Schodorf said. So Schodorf and his wife complained and were featured “on all the media” including CNN. FEMA included Café de Leche in federally funded clearing of debris after the media appearances, Schodorf said. He also credited L.A. County Supervisor Kathryn Barger’s office for advocating for them. 
Schodorf also said, as did others, that the Los Angeles Department of Economic Opportunity has been a huge help in providing information about grants and other support. 
Still, “it feels frustrating because it feels we are very small potatoes, especially from the perspective of the government,” he said. “It doesn’t seem like it would be too much to ask: waive permit fees, clean our lots out. Don’t make us go on national news pleading for help.”

Daniel Harlow, whose office was destroyed, agreed that businesses need more help. His custom computer programming and software development business is up and running again, but it was in a separate structure at his home and was a total loss. 
“A lot of rules for homeowners insurance don’t apply to businesses,” he said. “To not have more assistance for small and medium businesses is a problem.” 
For example, the state law that allows homeowners to get some upfront payouts without having to provide a full inventory of the contents of their home does not apply to businesses.
Harlow is now dealing with both rebuilding his office and repairing his house, which suffered some damage. He’s living in a rental home. 
“I’m trying to find architects and contractors while running my business,” he said. “It’s basically (another) full-time job.” 
A shift, and more changes ahead
Zak Fishman’s Prime Pizza in Altadena is the only pizza restaurant of the four in Altadena that survived the fire. It was a bit of good news for his family. Their house burned down, and they’re now rebuilding. 
Fishman, who owns several other locations in the Los Angeles area and elsewhere, said his Altadena location was closed for about a month but is now doing pretty well, considering the circumstances. 
“We do see a shift,” he said. “You see different types of people coming. A lot of workers in the area had nowhere else to eat (lunch).”
Fishman opened the Altadena location in September 2023 and was seeing a lot of growth, he said. He said sales at the location probably would have been up 20% over the prior year if the fire hadn’t happened. Now he says they’re up about 8% to 10%. 
“I’m certainly not complaining, it’s amazing,” he said.
With about half of Altadena’s businesses destroyed in the fire, it’s going to be a long way back. 
Judy Matthews, president of the Altadena Chamber of Commerce, said her group is working with other chambers and the county to help promote shopping local, and to identify more opportunities for grants and help for small and medium-size businesses.
“There’s increasing collaboration between local government and business,” she said. “That’s critical. No one man can stand alone and say I did it.”

When more of the community is able to rebuild, it could end up looking drastically different. Whether homeowners return could depend on their insurance provider and whether they can fill the gap from being underinsured, some said. Whether small businesses rebuild could depend on what type of service or goods they offer, and their location.
“Most worrisome are retail and specialty shops, and those that depend on a steady flow of  customers,” Matthews said, noting that Altadena’s limited foot traffic and visibility because of its location has been and will continue to be a factor.
Arnzen, the town council chair, said there is “a lot of competition for funds and assistance. There’s potential for people to feel left out. That is exacerbated by feelings of trauma and in some cases, historical neglect, especially from marginalized communities.”
Nearly half of Black households in Altadena, or 48%, were destroyed or had major damage, according to the NAACP. 
“We need to ensure a balanced recovery that supports diverse types of businesses,” Matthews said.
Orlandini, owner of the hardware store, said he expects his business and customers to change.
“It’s definitely going to be a different town,” he said. “My store was catered to older homes, and a lot of those are gone now.”
He added: “That’s the thing that bothers me most about the fire — how much of the history is gone and will never come back.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/011226_Altadena-Business_JH_CM_14.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-15 08:56:36.231608

One recent victory ended a National Guard deployment in Los Angeles.,"In summary
California Attorney General Rob Bonta has sued the Trump administration more than 50 times. One recent victory ended a National Guard deployment in Los Angeles.



At the end of December, the tide turned decisively against the Trump administration’s deployment of the National Guard in three states over the objections of their governors, including California. 
First, the U.S, Supreme Court on Dec. 23 sided with Illinois in its effort to block Trump from sending the National Guard to Chicago as part of its immigration crackdown. The court rejected the same legal reasoning that Trump used to federalize and deploy the National Guard in Los Angeles last summer when protests erupted there. 
“The government has not carried its burden to show that (the law) permits the President to federalize the Guard in the exercise of inherent authority to protect federal personnel and property in Illinois,” the unsigned order from the Supreme Court read. 
Then the administration quietly withdrew its appeal of a federal court decision that the president could not keep California National Guard troops under federal control in perpetuity. That withdrawal marked a victory for California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who had filed an amicus brief in the Illinois case. 
“The law got developed in a way that will prevent what happened over the last six months from ever happening again,” Bonta said. “I think this door is closed to Trump.”
CalMatters spoke with Bonta this week about those cases and how he views the Trump administration’s current focus on Minneapolis. The interview has been lightly edited for clarity.
CalMatters: In terms of what California does next on this issue, is there anything that you all are doing in preparation for maybe (large-scale immigration raids) coming back, or perhaps an escalation in tactics like we’re seeing in Minnesota? 
Bonta: We’re ready for anything. I think when you see incidents like we’re seeing in Minnesota, you have to assume that it could happen here in California. 
You know, the Trump administration has made no bones about it. They are going after blue states and only blue states. And it’s political, it’s weaponization, it is partisan. They’re trying to own the libs and get the Dems. That’s their whole reason for being. And chief among them, the biggest state in the nation that has rejected Trump three times when he’s running, that sticks in his craw, he doesn’t like it.
CalMatters: In Los Angeles, I don’t recall them going door-to-door to, you know, to try and grab people like we’re seeing in Minnesota. Is this an escalation?
Bonta: I think they’re escalating. Minnesota shows it seems to be an escalation. I mean, there were some pieces that are the same, that are horrific and terrorizing and traumatizing and inappropriate, like removing license plates and being in a moving truck, pulling up to a Home Depot and having people run out of the back and all the profiling that was being done.
I think it’s an escalation, and they’re doing more. They’re really trying to hammer Minneapolis and Minnesota. It’s the home of the vice presidential candidate that ran against Trump, right? It’s the place where their racism is on full display with their attacks on Somalis. It’s where the YouTuber was trying to suggest that there were child care centers that didn’t have any children and there was something inappropriate with what he was showing. 
So, Minnesota is a big target right now. California has always been, and I think they will put us back in the crosshairs at some point, and we’ll be ready.

CalMatters: What happened at the Supreme Court?
Bonta: The Supreme Court weighed in and basically said that the theory that the president had been operating on all along was completely unlawful and without foundation, truly a slap in the face and an embarrassing and devastating loss for Trump, who thinks he can always run to the Supreme Court and get what he wants. 
And they followed the law, the law that we had argued always applied, and that there was no authority … to deploy the military, that the “regular forces” included the military forces. There was no analysis that they were unable to execute the law, and there was no authority for the military to be even executing any laws, given the Posse Comitatus Act (which prevents the president from using the military as a domestic police force). So it was really a devastating and shocking loss for Trump.
CalMatters: The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the Trump administration to deploy the National Guard in L.A. in June, but ruled differently six months later. The district judge’s rationale was that Trump couldn’t re-federalize troops indefinitely. 
But does that indicate to you that if the material conditions on the ground in L.A. were to change, similar to what the Trump administration cited in June when they claimed protesters were committing violent acts against federal personnel and property, the Trump administration could authorize a new deployment? Is that your understanding, or am I wrong on that? 
Bonta: I think you’re wrong, but I don’t think it’s an unreasonable thing to say, but let me just explain my thinking. 
That case in L.A. in June was the very first one in the whole nation, and built into the exercise of authority of the federal administration here when it’s deploying the military is a great deal of deference. I think that deference was provided. It was the first case. There were mostly peaceful protests, but some violence, as you just mentioned. 
It was the first time they were seeing what the Trump administration was doing here. 
And then they saw it again in D.C. Then they saw it again in Portland, and they saw it again in Illinois. The judges saw what was happening, and they saw what’s being said, and saw the rationale, they saw how Trump said that Portland was a war zone when it was a peaceful city, they see how Trump says, ‘I’m going to bring the military in to do the very thing the Posse Comitatus Act prohibits, to enforce criminal law, because these blue cities are not cracking down on crime.’ Exactly what the military cannot do! 
And so they saw what he was doing with the military and I think they got a sense of where this was really headed and what was happening here. … So now that the U.S. Supreme Court has said you make sure “regular forces” is military forces, you need to make a showing that all the military forces cannot stop the concrete block from being thrown, or stop the Molotov cocktail from being thrown – he’ll never be able to show that – then you can bring in the National Guard. 
CalMatters: Just one point on that. Circumstances being what they are today, again, if they were to mimic whatever happened in June, would that be a different conversation if the material conditions on the ground change in Los Angeles? 
Bonta: Yeah, totally different. We’d go into court right away, we would win, we’d get an order, and the 9th Circuit would uphold it. Because there would be no showing that the military, all the military — I mean, thousands of military, there’s multiple military bases in California – that they couldn’t stop one person throwing concrete. I think our military is fully capable of that.
So, same exact circumstances from June happening today, 9th Circuit affirms it and does not stay it.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/010625-Limon-Senate-Pro-Tem-MG-CM-18.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-15 08:56:36.231608

Trevor Lee, R-Layton, speaks on the House floor at the Capitol in Salt Lake City on Thursday, Feb. 6, 2025. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)During a time when anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies have ramped up nationally under President Donald Trump’s administration, the Republican-controlled Utah Legislature is expected to debate a handful of bills aimed at restricting people without legal status from accessing public assistance programs and other resources — like their ability to legally drive or seek shelter. 
The question remains, however, whether the bills will survive both the House and the Senate — and the governor’s pen — in a state that historically has been welcoming to refugees and immigrants. The Utah Legislature’s 2026 general session, set to convene Tuesday, also comes during an election year, with 15 seats in the Senate and 75 in the House up for grabs.
One of Utah’s most hard-right Republicans, Rep. Trevor Lee is sponsoring those bills. The first to be filed — HB88 — would stop unauthorized immigrants in Utah from being able to access a wide range of publicly funded assistance programs. 
“That could be housing, that could be any type of health care, it could be homeless assistance, food stamps, I mean, you name it,” Lee, R-Layton, told Utah News Dispatch in an interview this week. 
Idaho Legislature passes bill blocking unauthorized immigrants from public services

If Lee’s bill is approved, it would likely restrict undocumented people from accessing the state’s Women, Infants and Children Program (known as WIC), which provides nutrition services and healthy food for pregnant, breastfeeding, and postpartum women, and to infants and children up to 5 years old. It could also restrict free vaccines, communicable disease treatments and a variety of other assistance programs that don’t currently require proof of U.S. citizenship for people seeking help. 
Lee’s bill is modeled after one passed by the Idaho Legislature last year. The American Civil Liberties Union of Idaho sued, alleging it unlawfully disqualifies otherwise eligible low-income immigrants from life-saving HIV treatment based solely on their immigration status. In July, a federal judge blocked the state of Idaho from requiring immigration status verification for federally-funded health services. 
Lee also said he plans to run a bill to “get rid of” the state’s driving privilege cards, which are state-issued licenses allowing people living in Utah who are undocumented or awaiting legal status to be able to legally drive. 
Additionally, Lee said he’s “copying” another law from Tennessee that broadly bans anyone from providing housing to undocumented people, whether through shelter or rent. A coalition of faith groups have sued, alleging the law is unconstitutional for criminalizing providing shelter to anyone who is undocumented, even when there is no intent to conceal them. 
As of Wednesday, HB88 was the only one of those bills to be publicly filed and published. Lee said he’s still working on the others. 
Answering a call from the Trump administration
Though immigration is a national issue, Lee said he wants Utah to answer a call from the Trump administration to “follow what other red states have been doing” and help “crack down” on undocumented people.
“The federal side has their things that they’re dealing with, and this has been a call from the Trump administration to crack down on it,” he said. “If we do our job and we get rid of these incentives, then many will self-deport without us having to forcibly do it.” 
Advocates and Democrats including House Minority Leader Angela Romero and Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla have criticized Lee’s proposals as “heartless” and “mean spirited” for targeting vulnerable populations.

Lee’s bills are “hurtful” and “tell people they don’t belong,” Romero said. 
She added that “everyone’s family, at some point, except our indigenous communities, immigrated here.” 
“I encourage my colleagues to have a little bit of compassion,” Romero said.
She also noted that many of the people impacted by Lee’s bill are part of “mixed-status families,” with kids who may be citizens but parents who are undocumented.
“It’s not like these individuals are not contributing to our economy,” she said. “They have to buy food. They also pay taxes. … So I get frustrated when there’s a stereotype (that) people who are aspiring to be citizens or aspiring for a better future for their family, that they are taking away from the system when, in actuality, a majority of them are putting more into our economy than they’re getting back.” 
It’s particularly “infuriating,” Romero said, that many people who would be impacted by Lee’s HB88 are children. 
Lee, who is up for reelection this year, said his aim is “putting Utahns first” while discouraging undocumented immigrants from staying in the state. 
“Why on earth, when there are struggling Utahns, would we ever allocate and put those resources to someone who is not even a citizen of this country?” Lee said.

Providing public assistance to undocumented immigrants, Lee said, is “incentivizing lawbreakers.” 
“We’re allowing people to break the law and then we give them free stuff,” he said. “And they’re going to go somewhere else if they don’t get it. They will self-deport.” 
To those who criticize his bill, Lee said, “They love putting other people over Utahns.” 
“I believe compassion stops where responsibility begins,” he said. “That’s what we’ve done in this country. We are $37 trillion in debt. And it’s because we have a third world that’s been imported here, and so many of them have broken the law, entered our country illegally, and instead of telling them to go back home, we give them free benefits. That is absolutely insane.” 
While Utah’s budget is balanced every year — with Republican leaders often lauding the state as being fiscally responsible — Lee said the state still has unfunded needs that it should be prioritizing over providing assistance to undocumented people. 
“We are continually criticized for not giving enough money to education. We’re continually criticized for not doing enough for air quality. There’s always something more that we could be funding,” he said. “And why are we putting someone who is not even a citizen over the needs of Utahns? What are we elected for, then? What are we doing?”
‘Diabolical’: Advocates widely oppose Lee’s approach
Gina Cornia, executive director of Utahns Against Hunger, expects the bill would have an impact not just on WIC, but also on a program that funds meal boxes for seniors in Utah and another that contributes stock to food pantries. 
“I think it’s diabolical, you know, that he’s really willing to literally deny people food in an effort to force them to go back, as if people can just pack up their satchel,” Cornia said. “I mean, it’s way more complicated than that, and in the meantime, what do people do?”

Cornia said the WIC program seeks to foster healthy communities and called Lee’s proposal “a violation of our morality as a state.” 
“If the very least we can do for people is make sure they have food, we should be doing that,” Cornia said. 
She said the change would create a bigger administrative burden for the state government. And she said it’s not feasible to expect small food pantries with thin staffing and budgets to spend time checking into a visitor’s immigration status. 
“I mean, are we going to be asking a small church pantry to verify people’s immigration status? It just doesn’t make sense to us,” Cornia said. 
She noted immigrants living in the U.S. without documents are already ineligible for benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Under federal changes that took effect in November, refugees who aren’t lawful permanent residents no longer qualify for SNAP benefits either. 
Nationwide immigration raids bring fear to Latinos in Utah, but a glimmer of hope prevails

Moe Hickey, executive director of the advocacy group Voices for Utah Children, said Lee’s HB88 “is not even good policy,” noting, for example, that limiting vaccination efforts for undocumented people puts the whole community at higher risk. 
“So we’re going to say children who are going to come to school unvaccinated because they’re undocumented? That’s putting other children at risk,” Hickey said. “It’s very poorly thought out legislation, and it’s clearly a message. But it’s just not good policy.” 
To that argument, Lee said, “If we’re so worried about these people needing our vaccines, they shouldn’t be here.” 
Hickey said the bill would also add to a “chilling effect” that’s already impacting immigrant communities under the Trump administration.
“When you start running bills that are targeting a community, then the community starts living in more fear,” he said. “And then they’re not taking advantage of benefits that they potentially are eligible for. But they’re going further into the shadows. Which, you know, good immigration policy should be the opposite. We should be providing people with safety and a path forward. Not pushing them into the corner.” 
Hickey argued that HB88 wouldn’t result in savings — but rather push higher costs on emergency rooms and hospital systems. 
To Lee’s arguments that resources should go to “Utahns first,” Hickey argued, “they are.” He said undocumented people don’t impact the ability of Utahns to access the benefits
“Not at all,” he said. “What impacts Utahns, for some of these services, are bad policies coming from the federal government.” Work requirements on SNAP, for example, have a much bigger impact on eligible people accessing food nutrition benefits, he said. 
Aden Batar, director of migration and refugee services for Catholic Community Services, said also “we are deeply concerned” about Lee’s HB88. 
“From our direct service experience, we know that policies limiting access to these essential supports do not reduce need — they simply push families into crisis and place greater strain on emergency systems, hospitals, shelters, schools, and local nonprofits,” Batar said. 
More uncertainty surrounds SNAP program as new changes take effect

Additionally, Batar said Catholic Community Services serves “many mixed status households with children who are U.S. citizens or lawfully present, but depend on shared family stability to remain healthy and housed.” 
“When parents are afraid to seek food, medical care, or shelter, children suffer first,” Batar said. “Public health is also put at risk when families avoid vaccination and preventive care out of fear or confusion.”
Batar also expressed particular concern about added administrative burdens the bill would put on local providers. 
“Requiring service organizations to verify immigration status diverts limited resources away from care, undermines trust between providers and families, and conflicts with the humanitarian and faith-based missions of many Utah nonprofits,” Batar said. 
Batar urged lawmakers to consider the “real-world impacts of this legislation” and people and service providers across the state, and to “pursue solutions that uphold human dignity, public health and the common good.” 
Will Lee’s bills find traction? 
In a wide-ranging interview this week with one of Utah’s most powerful lawmakers, Senate President Stuart Adams, Utah News Dispatch asked about Lee’s HB88 and whether he supports it.
Adams, R-Layton, did not take a position on Lee’s HB88, saying he needed to look at the bill. He said the Senate will evaluate what survives the House. 
Generally, though, Adams said undocumented immigrants who are “productive” should be allowed to stay, while those who are “doing things illegally, they need to go home.”
“I just want to make sure we keep America strong and keep us secure,” he said. “It seems to me that the better solution is to find a way to bring people through with less restrictions legally.” 
The Senate president acknowledged immigration is a federal issue that Congress needs to tackle — and it’s a “problem” and a “disappointment” that it has failed to fix the system.

Adams said as Utah lawmakers debate immigration issues, including Lee’s bills, he’s not sure where the House and Senate will land. 
“I don’t know what we’ll do,” he said. “My hope is we’ll find common sense. And we need people to work. And we need people to stay here that are productive. The people that aren’t … that are doing things illegally, ought to go home.” 
Romero, the House’s top Democrat, said she hopes Lee’s bills won’t find any traction “because I think they’re cruel, they’re message bills, and I hope that the majority of the body doesn’t share that ideology.”
It’s possible Lee’s proposals will find more support in the House but hit roadblocks in the Senate. But that’s hard to predict — especially during an election year, Hickey said. 
“I do think the general public is less inclined to support these,” Hickey said, though he added there may also be “a pocket of the public that would be on board.” 
In the past, the Senate “has been sort of the safeguard of things like this not going forward,” Hickey said, “but that being said, it’s hard to read the tea leaves right now.” 
Asked if he’s worried if HB88 could run into trouble in the Senate, Lee said: “If my colleagues want to tell their constituents they’re putting a noncitizen over Utahns, like, be my guest. But no, for the most part, the vast majority of my colleagues I’ve talked to said they will vote for this legislation.”

Designed to complement the Capitol’s neoclassical architecture and house Utah’s first state history museum, the building serves as an expansion of the Capitol campus and a symbolic gateway through Utah’s history. 
The project marks the completion of the master plan for Capitol Hill, written more than a century ago. The northern entrance flows through the building and out onto the lawn, creating a direct pathway that guides visitors beneath a one-of-a-kind stained glass skylight leading to the Capitol building.

“It was imperative in the master plan that the new North Capitol Building fit within the neoclassical design of the campus,” said Nathan Levitt, the project’s principal architect with VCBO Architecture. 
Preservation extended beyond architectural style. During construction, crews altered the building’s underground footprint to protect historic sequoia trees on the north law. According to the Capitol Preservation Board’s Executive Director Dana Jones, a wall in the parking garage was shifted 18 inches during construction to avoid damaging the trees’ root systems. 
“I think that that’s a really special fact, because to me, it speaks to the level of care that our team has as a whole,” Jones said. “This is us paying forward to many generations.”
At the center of the building is a $1.6 million stained glass laylight showcasing Utah’s natural wonders and cultural symbols. Made up of more than 14,700 individual pieces of glass with sand from all 29 Utah counties, the piece incorporates iconic Utah scenes like the Great Salt Lake and southern Utah’s red rock formations. 
Inflation drove up project budget
The project cost $320 million, exceeding initial estimates of $165 million, according to Andy Marr, the director of Utah’s Division of Facilities Construction and Management. 
“Over a number of years (the budget) grew through different amounts of appropriations that the legislature approved as the project scope started to evolve,” Marr said. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“We were talking about this building as just a replacement for parking,” he said. “That conversation quickly evolved into, ‘this is the opportunity to finish the master plan of Capitol Hill.’”
Marr also mentioned inflation as contributing to the rising budget.
“We went through a pretty rough period of construction escalation, peaking at 14% (inflation),” he said. “That was a part of the cost factoring here that’s pretty standard industry wide.”
Construction
The building was constructed by Oakland Construction, along with collaboration from various other groups. Michael Despain, the project director for Oakland, said the building is “intentionally a step down” in comparison to the Capitol. 
“We wanted this building to not be as formal as the Capitol,” he said. “The Capitol is the highlight of the campus, and everything here is intentionally just a little bit more subdued.”

Despain also described the scale of the project. More than 450,000 cubic yards of concrete were poured during construction, enough to fill 4,500 trucks or lay a 4-foot-wide sidewalk stretching nearly 200 miles long. 
Employing an average of 266 workers per day and 350 workers per day during peak construction, Despain said the project took 581,000 hours of labor to finish. 
“For one person, that’s roughly 283 years for one guy to build this,” he said. 
“Lots of collaboration between VCBO, the Capital Preservation Board, DFCM, Oakland, and all of our trade partners,” Despain said. “It’s been an amazing, historical, iconic project.”
Museum of Utah History
The North Capitol Building includes Utah’s first dedicated state history museum, set to open in June 2026. 
“This is the space where, really, Utah’s fine art collection and history’s preservation will happen for the next 100 years,” said Tim Glenn, the museum director. 
Glenn explained the museum will display 950 artifacts when it opens, with a regular rotation moving through the exhibition space. The North Capitol Building also includes a specialized storage area suited to house all of the state’s historical pieces.

“This is purpose-built and state of the art. It provides (an) opportunity for us to grow. All of the state’s treasures will be here, and future state treasures will be here,” he said. “Our collection currently has around 30,000 artifacts, 28,000 books, 8,500 manuscripts, 23,000 pamphlets, and many, many other materials,” he said. “All of that will be stored in this space.”
Showcasing the state’s historical collection in the museum also opens up the public’s access to them, Glenn noted.
“We also have our engagement room in this building,” he said. “If (visitors are) doing research or have an interest in a particular artifact or manuscript collection, they can make an appointment in our engagement room and pull artifacts from this space right up into that research area.”
A ribbon cutting ceremony will commence Friday at 12:30 p.m. The North Capitol Building opens to the public on Tuesday, on the first day of the legislative session.

Matt Simpson, R-Daphne, stands on the floor of the Alabama House of Representatives on Feb. 8, 2024 in Montgomery, Alabama. The House Judiciary Committee passed two bills sponsored by Simpson to expand the circumstances that prosecutors may seek the death penalty. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama House committee Wednesday approved two bills that would expand the list of criminal offenses eligible for the death penalty.
The House Judiciary Committee approved HB 41 and HB 20, both sponsored by Rep. Matt Simpson, R-Daphne. HB 41 would make it it a capital offense to rape, sodomize or sexually torture a child younger than 12 years old. HB 20 would make it a capital offense to murder someone while also creating “a great risk of death to multiple persons.”
“Some people need to die,” Simpson, a former child victims prosecutor in Baldwin County, told the committee on Wednesday. “That is exactly the point. This is the worst of the worst offenses. These people are taking advantage of children who cannot defend themselves. These are the absolute victims of society.”
The legislation, if passed, would join laws passed by other conservative states seeking to challenge a 2008 U.S. Supreme Court decision that declared the death penalty unconstitutional for all offenses except murder.
The bill retains much of the language that is already in statute but adds the three different offenses to what is essentially a growing list of aggravating circumstances that make someone eligible to be put to death.
Alabama law currently identifies 21 aggravating factors that allow prosecutors to charge a person with capital punishment and, by extension, allow a defendant to be put to death. Among them is murdering a first responder while the person is on duty, murdering someone with a deadly weapon while in a vehicle, or murdering someone in the presence of a child who is younger than 14 years old “if the victim was the parent or legal guardian of the child.” But murder is the only offense subject to the death penalty.
Simpson filed a nearly identical bill that was approved by the House Judiciary Committee early in the 2025 session but did not pass the Legislature.
The U.S. Supreme Court in 2008 struck down a Louisiana law allowing the death penalty for child rape in a case known as Kennedy v. Louisiana. Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy cited concerns that imposing the death penalty would discourage child abuse reporting and put victims’ lives in danger. He also noted a victim in the capital child abuse case had to repeatedly describe her trauma to investigators and prosecutors.
“During formative years of her adolescence, made all the more daunting for having to come to terms with the brutality of her experience, (the victim) was required to discuss the case at length with law enforcement personnel,” Kennedy wrote.
Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, cited those concerns in committee on Wednesday.
“In pursuit of the death penalty in that particular situation, you would not only require the person to be courageous enough, and the family to be courageous enough, to come forward, and say, ‘We want this person prosecuted,’ but the victim and the victim’s family would also have to participate in the decision to ultimately kill that person too,” England said. “The victim, in that situation, would be less likely to come forward knowing that prosecuting that person means that coach, pastor, aunt, uncle, mom, dad, whoever, would not only be prosecuted, but they would also be put to death.”
He was also concerned that the law could provide leverage to perpetrators when dealing with the victim.
“Imagine you being an abuser, and the law hands you the ultimate tool to abuse a victim by not only saying, ‘You will destroy our family if you turn me in, but you will also kill me too,’” England said.
Other people that advocate on behalf of children have concerns with the bill.
“In general, we want to ensure that the population that the bill is intended to protect and to bring justice for really are the children,” said Apreill Hartsfield, director of policy, advocacy and research for VOICES for Alabama’s Children.
Florida in 2023 and Tennessee in 2024 enacted similar laws in the hopes of challenging the previous precedent in the U.S. Supreme Court.
“What they are doing is showing that it is not unusual, and this is a nationwide push to show that this is not an unusual punishment, and therefore the rationale in Kennedy is no longer valid,” Simpson said.
HB 20 adds murdering someone while risking the lives of others as another aggravating circumstance to the list of offenses that make someone eligible for capital punishment.
Simpson is introducing his bills to expand capital punishment as public support for the death patently continues to wane. About 52% currently support the death penalty, lower than the 80% who said they approve of it in 1994. The number of people who oppose the death penalty has increased, from 16% in the 1990s to about 40% in recent years.

Youchah said during a hearing Wednesday, in a reversal of her previous denial.
“We are here today because, candidly, sometimes I think too much,” Youchah told attorneys for MGM Grand and Dwight Manley, a California businessman who is suing the casino giant in federal court. Manley claims he was drugged with ketamine while playing blackjack in the MGM Grand Mansion, an enclave for high rollers. 
He alleges MGM executives took advantage of his drugged condition by increasing his longstanding $1 million credit limit to $3.5 million in the course of an afternoon, despite erratic behavior witnessed by his friends and acknowledged by his longtime casino host, according to court documents. In his suit, Manley contends that credit extensions exceeding a gambler’s previous limit are granted in small increments, not millions of dollars at a time. 
The gambler has purchased billboards seeking information from witnesses and offering a reward. 
Attorney Lawrence Semenza III, who represents MGM in the suit, called the litigation “a fishing expedition.”
MGM, according to legal filings, suggests Manley was trying to get out of paying his gambling debts. Manley counters in pleadings that he paid his host $560,000 on the plane ride back to California. He also made no effort to stop payment when MGM deposited his markers, according to the lawsuit. 
Manley’s attorney, Paul Hejmanowski, has 60 days to complete the depositions, the judge ordered. 
Responsible gambling?
After a few hours gambling on Dec. 10, 2021, Manley felt “disoriented and ‘out of it,’” according to the lawsuit filed against MGM. At about 4 p.m., according to a video log composed by MGM, a cocktail server brought Manley his fifth drink. Within minutes he shattered an ashtray, cut his hand, and was bleeding on the blackjack table.
Manley – described by his then-girlfriend (now wife) in her voluntary statement to police as “a heavyweight, i.e., not a lightweight” when it comes to drinking – “does not recall cutting his hand, did not feel any pain, and was unaware that he was bleeding,” the lawsuit says. 
According to the video log from MGM, within minutes Manley began playing again at a different blackjack table.
Manley, in his police report, says he was told that “my casino host informed my three friends in the bar area that surveillance advised her that I was acting erratic. At no point, other than temporarily when my hand was bleeding, did MGM do anything to stop my play. To the contrary, MGM increased my credit limit by $2,500,000.”
“I may want to fly home tonight,” Manley, who flew to Las Vegas on an MGM plane, texted his casino host the morning after he was allegedly drugged. “I think someone must have spiked a drink.” 
Manley’s casino host, Vanessa Reboton, in a text message, suggests Manley get intravenous hydration. 
“At no time did anyone from the MGM suggest that Dwight should see a doctor or have a blood draw done to test for drugs,” according to Hejmanowski.
Later that day, Reboton told Manley she had requested tapes of his play from casino surveillance.
“It is my belief that the video evidence will demonstrate that Mr. Manley was visibly impaired, could not balance himself, and fell multiple times,” Manley’s initial attorney David Chesnoff wrote to MGM legal counsel Ashley Eddy three days after the incident. “During the above stated time frame of Mr. Manley’s visible impairment he executed several casino markers in amounts that exceed his traditional gambling history with MGM Resorts International.” 
In a voluntary statement to the Nevada Gaming Control Board, Manley said his credit limit “has been $1,000,000 for approximately ten years.”
Under Nevada Gaming Regulation 5.011, permitting a person who is visibly impaired by alcohol or any other drug to gamble or be served complimentary drinks “is inimical to the public health, safety, morals, good order, or general welfare of the people of the State of Nevada, or that would reflect or tend to reflect discredit upon the State of Nevada or the gaming industry,” and is grounds for disciplinary action.
In Oct. 2022, gaming agent Terry Ochal notified Manley his case “has been approved by supervisors” for review by legal counsel. 
“I can’t imagine a victim has to be further harmed by having to be in the dark like this,” a frustrated Manley responded. 
“…as I explained in our first conversation, in an NGCB Regulation case you are considered a witness, not a victim,” Ochal told Manley. “The case itself is between the Board and the licensee.” 
Gaming regulators have taken no disciplinary action against MGM.
Company town?
Manley, in his pleadings, implies that Las Vegas is run by casino companies, and that Metro does their bidding. Both Metro and MGM, he suggests, skrimped on their investigations of the alleged drugging. 
The gambler submitted a police report to Metro in March 2022, along with a drug test that revealed the presence of ketamine in his hair. Ketamine is a powerful drug used to sedate animals. The test detected no other narcotics. 
Two lie detector tests arranged by Chesnoff, and turned over to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police, determined Manley was not deceptive when he asserted he did not use drugs while gambling and has not in the past. 
Metro, according to a deposition in the case, closed its investigation without interviewing the bartender who mixed the drink the gambler suspects left him incapacitated.
The bartender, Jerilyn Koch, testified in a March deposition that she was interviewed once by the Nevada Gaming Control Board about the allegations, but never by police, or by MGM.
MGM did not respond to requests for comment on their internal investigation protocol. Metro declined to discuss its probe. 
Manley’s casino host, Reboton, testified in deposition that she also was never questioned by Metro or her employer. 
Reboton, Hejmanowski said, acknowledged to others shortly after Manley left the casino that he was “wasted or drunk,” raising questions about why he was granted more credit. 
Metro has also withheld casino video which purportedly shows no wrongdoing, claiming it is evidence in the case, which is closed. 
“I have received and reviewed video footage that was provided by MGM,” Det. Justin Adkins told Manley via email in August 2022. “In the footage there wasn’t any evidence that proved an employee did any illegal acts.” Adkins added he was closing the case.  
“I am really shocked that only watching the tape is the depth of this investigation,” Manley responded in the email, adding “Ketamine mixed with alcohol is a deadly combination, which could have easily killed me.”
Metro declined to provide the Current with the video, reiterating its claim that it is evidence. A video that lacks images of a criminal act is generally not considered evidence, according to legal experts. Evidence, they say, must be impounded.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/leothelion-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 08:56:36.231608
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-15 13:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,US will suspend immigrant visa processing from 75 countries,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/15/us-will-suspend-immigrant-visa-processing-from-75-countries/,The State Dept said it will suspend processing visas for citizens of countries whose nationals the Trump admin. has deemed likely to need public assistance.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The State Department said Wednesday it will suspend the processing of immigrant visas for citizens of 75 countries, including Afghanistan, Iran, Russia and Somalia, whose nationals the Trump administration has deemed likely to require public assistance while living in the United States.
The State Department, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, said it had instructed consular officers to halt immigrant visa applications from the countries affected in accordance with a broader order issued in November that tightened rules around potential immigrants who might become “public charges” in the U.S.
The step builds on earlier immigration and travel bans by the administration on nearly 40 countries and is part of President Donald Trump’s ongoing efforts to tighten U.S. entry standards for foreigners.
“The Trump administration is bringing an end to the abuse of America’s immigration system by those who would extract wealth from the American people,” the department said in a statement. “Immigrant visa processing from these 75 countries will be paused while the State Department reassess immigration processing procedures to prevent the entry of foreign nationals who would take welfare and public benefits.”
The suspension, which will begin Jan. 21, will not apply to applicants seeking non-immigrant visas, or temporary tourist or business visas, who make up the vast majority of visa seekers. Demand for non-immigrant visas is expected to rise dramatically in the coming months and years due to the upcoming 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics both of which the U.S. will host or co-host.
Cable calls for screening of non-immigrant visa applicants
A separate notice sent to all U.S. embassies and consulates said that non-immigrant visa applicants should be screened for the possibility that they might seek public benefits in the United States.
“With the uncovering of massive public benefits fraud across the United States, the Trump administration is laser-focused on eliminating and preventing fraud in public benefits programs,” said the cable that referred specifically to most non-immigrant visa applications and was sent on Monday.
The cable, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press, urged consular officers to ensure that foreigners wanting to travel to the U.S. “have been fully vetted and screened” for whether they may rely on public services before they are issued a visa.
The cable noted several times that it is up to the applicant to prove that they would not apply for public benefits while in the U.S. and said consular officers who suspect the applicant might apply should require them to fill out a form proving their financial bona fides.
President Donald Trump’s administration has already severely restricted immigrant and non-immigrant visa processing for citizens of dozens of countries, many of them in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
Consular officials must consider a range of personal details
The November guidance on which Wednesday’s decision is based directed U.S. Embassy and consulate officials to comprehensively and thoroughly vet visa applicants to demonstrate that they will not need to rely on public benefits from the government any time after their admission in the U.S.
While federal law already required those seeking permanent residency or legal status to prove they wouldn’t be a public charge, Trump in his first term widened the range of benefit programs that could disqualify applicants, and the guidelines in the cable appear to go further in scope.
Immigrants seeking entry into the U.S. already undergo a medical exam by a physician who’s been approved by a U.S. Embassy. They are screened for communicable diseases, like tuberculosis, and asked to disclose any history of drug or alcohol use, mental health conditions or violence. They’re also required to have a number of vaccinations.
The new directive expanded those with more specific requirements. It said consular officials must consider a range of specific details about people seeking visas, including their age, health, family status, finances, education, skills and any past use of public assistance regardless of the country. It also said they should assess applicants’ English proficiency and can do so by conducting interviews in English.
Experts said at the time it could further limit who gets to enter the country at a time when the Republican administration is already tightening those rules.

“The law already prohibited taking someone’s organs without permission, this adds a penalty to that because, apparently, this is a problem,” England said during a House Judiciary Committee meeting.

In 2024, eight families sued the Alabama Department of Corrections, alleging that the department harvested the organs of their loved ones, who died while in prison, and sent them to the University of Alabama Birmingham Heersink School of Medicine.
According to the lawsuit, a group of medical students from the school noticed that many of the specimens they worked with in the curriculum were taken from people who died while in Alabama’s prisons.
The university and the Alabama Department of Corrections sought to have the case dismissed in February claiming that the university is immune from civil litigation filed by the plaintiffs. The Montgomery Circuit court ruled against the motion to dismiss and allowed the case to move forward.

The Mason-Dixon poll shows Jolly, a former Republican member of Congress, leading Demings, mayor of Orange County, 23%-19%. But 58% are undecided in the August primary.
It’s a little clearer in the GOP primary in the Mason-Dixon survey, with Naples U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds with a huge lead over three other Republicans.
Donalds gets 37% of the vote, with Lt. Gov. Jay Collins (now officially in the race), a distant second with 7%. Former House Speaker Paul Renner is at 4% and investment firm CEO James Fishback is at 3%.
However, nearly half (49%) say they are undecided in the Republican race.
Other polls taken in recent months show Donalds leading in the GOP race, with his numbers rising exponentially when pollsters inform Republican voters that Donalds has been endorsed by President Donald Trump.
“It should be noted that Donalds is the only candidate in either race whose name is recognized by more than half of his party’s voters,” said Mason-Dixon pollster Brad Coker. ” That name recognition advantage is an important factor behind his frontrunner status.”
The poll was conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy from Jan. 8 through Jan. 13, 2026.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Nevada Democratic U.S. Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen want to redirect a portion of funding allocated for immigration enforcement as part of the GOP-backed multitrillion-dollar domestic spending and tax cut package passed last year toward local law enforcement. 
Their proposal comes a day after Congressional Progressive Democrats vowed to oppose any funding for ICE after a Minnesota woman was killed by an immigration officer. The push comes amid recent polling that indicates growing support for abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The Nevada Democrats’ proposal also came on the same day as the centrist Searchlight Institute, founded by a staffer for the late Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid, pleaded with congressional Democrats not to fall into a “trap” by allowing themselves to be accused of wanting to “defund” ICE, the Bulwark reported.
The massive spending bill signed by President Donald Trump last summer allocated $175 billion to immigration enforcement over several years. Cortez Masto and Rosen said on Wednesday they were sponsoring legislation that would reallocate $75 billion to law enforcement.  
“The Trump Administration’s actions are not making our communities any safer, in fact they’re doing just the opposite,” Cortez Masto said in a statement. “Instead of giving ICE $75 billion extra dollars to hire untrained ICE agents to patrol American communities, let’s invest that money where it will actually help – in hiring local police officers who are trained to fight crime in a way that earns community trust.”
Many local police agencies work with ICE to conduct enforcement. The ACLU found in the first eight months of Trump’s second term “the number of local agencies opting to act as deportation force multipliers has grown by 600 percent.”
Funding for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which houses ICE, is expected to be debated as the U.S. Senate takes up appropriations bills ahead of a Jan. 30 deadline. 
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday that ICE funding is “one of the major issues that the appropriators are confronting right now.” 
The Congressional Progressive Caucus, of which Rep. Steven Horsford is the only Nevada member, said this week it would oppose any federal funding going toward immigration enforcement. 
Their announcement follows the death of 37-year-old Renee Good, who was killed last week by an immigration officer. Her death has sparked nationwide protests, including some in Nevada. 
The Trump administration has spent the first year back in office carrying out a campaign promise for more aggressive immigration enforcement and a pledge for mass deportation. 
Both Cortez Masto and Rosen noted in their announcement Wednesday that 73% of individuals held in ICE detention didn’t have a criminal conviction while less than 5% had a violent criminal conviction. They also pointed to a ProPublica analysis that found more than 170 U.S. citizens had been detained by ICE.

(Photo by Seanna Adcox/SC Daily Gazette) COLUMBIA — Republican legislators’ latest attempt to further limit abortions in South Carolina would put drugs used for medication abortions in the same category as Valium and Xanax.
A 3-2 vote Wednesday along party lines advanced the bill to the full House Judiciary Committee, where it’s certain to win approval: Its chairman, Rep. Weston Newton, is the main sponsor.
The proposal would classify mifepristone and misoprostol as Schedule IV drugs, making possession legal only by prescription.
Violators could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to prison for up to five years. Anyone who gives the drugs to a pregnant woman without her knowledge intending to cause an abortion could be sent to prison for 10 years. However, the bill specifies that a pregnant woman could not be prosecuted for having the drugs for her own use.
A second bill taken up by the panel would do the opposite. It would intentionally punish women for having an abortion by extending all legal protections to the womb from fertilization. Abortion would be legally on par with murder.
Its sponsor, Rep. Rob Harris of Spartanburg County, said he wants to end abortions by erasing women’s “complete immunity” from prosecution.

“Murdering anyone should be illegal for everyone,” said the father of 10 and member of the hardline Freedom Caucus.
Harris’ bill, titled “Prenatal Equal Protection,” is not expected to get any traction. Other than Harris, the subcommittee heard from two speakers on his bill, one for and one against, before adjourning without a vote.
“The reality is, you’re going after women making the most traumatic decision of their life. … You’re going after women trying to become mothers. You’re going after me,” said Tori Nardone, who shared needing to go out of state for an abortion after her doctor diagnosed a fatal fetal anomaly. Under the state’s abortion ban, her situation should’ve been an allowed exception, but her doctor feared making that call. “I couldn’t get care” in South Carolina, she said.
“Bills like these do nothing but terrify women out of wanting to get pregnant,” she told the panel. “Please don’t make it worse than it already is.”
Harris’ bill is unlikely to get a second hearing. Even some of the state’s most strident abortion foes say it goes too far.
It’s largely the same proposal he introduced in 2023. That bill never got a hearing, but the House rejected it when he offered it as an amendment during a floor debate. National headlines followed about South Carolina potentially allowing the death sentence for women, prompting 12 GOP co-sponsors to remove their names. The bill died with the end of the 2024 session. But Harris, an emergency room nurse, was undeterred and reintroduced the proposal ahead of the 2025 session’s start. House rules guaranteed him one hearing, which occurred Wednesday.
A companion bill was introduced Tuesday by Sen. Lee Bright, the former senator who won a special election in December to retake the seat he lost in 2016.
At a news conference with Harris ahead of session’s opening, the Spartanburg Republican recognized the bill’s slim chances.
“I know we’ve got hearts and minds to change,” he said. “God’s in the hearts-and-minds-changing business.”
Two months ago, a Senate panel rejected legislation that banned abortion from the onset of pregnancy and criminalized women for getting an abortion. In a panel chaired by the bill’s author, even one of its co-sponsors ultimately couldn’t support it.
Asked about the chances of an abortion debate again this year, Senate GOP leaders indicated they want to move on.
“We don’t need to do it,” said Senate Education Chairman Greg Hembree of Horry County. Referring to the six-week ban that took effect in 2023, he said, “We passed a bill. We need to let the bill work. We need to see how it goes. We need to let it play out a bit, and if we need to — two, three, five years from now — evaluate, OK, let’s do that. In the meantime, the Senate’s spoken. Let’s move on for a while.”
Sen. Tom Davis went further, emphatically promising to block any bill that bans abortion from conception, saying that’s “so far out of touch” with most South Carolinians’ opinions. If the proposal is revived in committee, he will work to stop it from advancing. And if it manages to get to the floor anyway, he will use Senate rules to ensure it gets no further.
“I’m committed to making sure that doesn’t happen,” the Beaufort Republican told the SC Daily Gazette last week. In fall 2022, it was Davis’ promised filibuster that ended debate on a proposed ban from conception.
But a bill that targets mailed abortion medication drugs is different, said Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey.
“If we can focus on that, we can probably get strong support,” said the Edgefield Republican, who called the drugs mailed from another state an “end run” to state law.
The bulk of Wednesday’s two-hour House hearing was spent on Newton’s bill.
It’s already illegal for providers in South Carolina to mail the two pills that end a pregnancy. The two-step regimen is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to end a pregnancy through 10 weeks’ gestation. In South Carolina, that option remains legal through six weeks. But the drugs must be handed over at the clinic.
Other states, however, allow providers to mail drugs for a medication abortion following a telehealth visit — including to patients in states with abortion bans — and shield them from prosecution. That’s led to lawsuits filed in Texas and Louisiana against doctors in New York and California.
Data from one of the nation’s largest online providers shows that 84% of their prescriptions over 15 months went to patients in abortion-ban states, according to a report last August by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin.
Advocates of Newton’s bill said it would help South Carolina in court.
“What this bill does is gives another arrow in your quiver when you go to the courts to enforce the state of South Carolina’s law,” former GOP Rep. Garry Smith, who represented a Greenville County seat for 19 years, told his colleagues. ‘This is another mechanism to support your case.”
But opponents of the measure said changing the drugs’ classification will further endanger women in a state that already has one of the nation’s highest death rates for women dying during pregnancy, childbirth or soon after.
Newton stressed that the drugs would remain available by prescription. Nothing in the bill bans the drug, he said.
But opponents countered it will still be harder for women to access the drugs for non-abortion health care.
Dr. Tricia Seal, an OB-GYN in Columbia, said the drugs’ safe and effective gynecological uses include miscarriages and other emergencies. She keeps them available in her office, but she couldn’t do that if the drugs were reclassified as Schedule IV. Requiring her to write a prescription to get filled elsewhere would delay care, she said.
“The impact on miscarriage and stillborn care is so profound, harm is guaranteed,” she said.
Dr. Rebecca Haskell, an OB-GYN resident in Columbia, said the bill will cause more doctors-in-training to avoid South Carolina. This spring, she and her classmates will travel to New York for a two-week crash course on maternal care that can’t be part of their training in South Carolina, she said.
The bill “will continue to drive away the next generation of eager, capable, confident physicians,” she said. “I urge you to put ideology aside. Women in South Carolina already can’t find an OB-GYN.”
Former Sen. Penry Gustafson called the bill unwise, unkind, and cruel. She accused the sponsors of being “pro-forced birth and pro-forced surgery.”
“I’m not talking about family values; I’m talking about miscarriage,” said the Camden Republican, one of the “sister senators” who lost her re-election bid in 2024 after uniting against the six-week ban.
“Your continued push to ban all abortions and anything related will cause real women standing beside us to die,” she said. “You have the opportunity to take a real concerted long pause on this one. This bill has not been thought through.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/penry-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-15 10:00:05.179225

(Stock photo by Darrin Klimek/Getty Images)New Jersey officials have released recommendations for how the state should repurpose two jails for law-breaking youth, even though the jails remain open nearly a decade after the state first vowed to close them.
Former Gov. Chris Christie in 2017 ordered the closure of the New Jersey Training School in Monroe, a 200-bed facility for boys in Monroe, and the Female Secure Care and Intake Facility, a 48-bed facility known as Hayes in Bordentown. The jails are to be replaced by three smaller lockups that look and function more like schools, to be located in north, central, and southern parts of the state.
In a new report released Tuesday, a youth justice working group convened in July 2024 by Attorney General Matt Platkin urged policymakers to convert the sites into places of restorative or therapeutic programming that serve low-income communities and people impacted by the criminal justice system.
NJ lawmakers pass bill to expand protections for women in prison

Their suggestions include a school, vocational and career training, reentry programming, affordable housing, recreational uses, a heritage center that tells the story of the sites, or a New Jersey Center for Peace and Restorative Justice modeled after the Equal Justice Initiative’s Legacy Sites in Montgomery, Alabama, which are part museum and part memorial.
Neither site should be used for correctional purposes, and their reuse should honor their history, the working group said.
Hayes is located on the site of a historic boarding school for Black youth called the New Jersey Manual Training and Industrial School for Colored Youth. That school was founded in 1886 by the Rev. Walter A.S. Rice, a formerly enslaved Civil War veteran, and was once known as the “Tuskegee of the North,” attracting visitors including Nat King Cole, W.E.B. DuBois, and Booker T. Washington, and lecturers including Albert Einstein and Paul Robeson. The state closed it in 1955 after integration attempts failed.
The New Jersey Training School, which is known as Jamesburg, opened in 1867 as the New Jersey State Reform School to remove troubled youth from adult prisons.
Platkin acknowledged he won’t be around to supervise the sites’ reuse, with Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill naming Jen Davenport to Platkin’s post. Sherrill will be sworn in Tuesday. But he applauded the recommendations as “staying true to my mandate of providing innovative opportunities for populations historically and disproportionately, disadvantaged by the youth criminal justice system.”
“The Working Group’s proposals are significant, thoughtful, and a critical contribution to the discussions that this State is having around the future of these sites set for closure,” Platkin wrote in the report. “While my Office will not be the ultimate decision-maker as to the disposition of these facilities, I know that this Report will provide essential guidance as these projects proceed.”
Just over 400 juveniles and young adults, from age 14 into their 20s, are in custody or under the supervision of juvenile justice authorities in New Jersey, according to state data. Most — 244 boys and four girls — are in youth prisons, while another 32 are in residential community homes and 118 are under parole supervision in the community.
Construction on the smaller replacement jails has begun in Ewing and Winslow, though they’re not expected to open until at least 2027. The state is still finalizing a location for the northern site, the report says.
Members of the working group include advocates from the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice, Salvation and Social Justice, and the Bordentown Historical Society, as well as youth justice officials and experts.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Former Vice President Kamala Harris spoke in Jackson at the newly reopened Thalia Mara Hall on Wednesday, stopping in Mississippi’s capital city for the second part of her book tour as she mulls another presidential campaign. 
Harris was greeted with a warm reception from a packed audience at Thalia Mara, which had been closed since August of 2024 for renovations. Jackson Mayor John Horhn kicked off the event by awarding Harris a key to the city and announcing that he had signed a proclamation making Jan. 14 “Kamala Harris Day” in Jackson.   
“Kamala, you don’t know what you mean to Jackson, Mississippi,” Horhn said. “You don’t know what you mean to America.”
Harris spoke for roughly an hour with Rita Brent, a comedian and writer from Jackson. Harris was in town to promote her book “107 Days,” which details what Harris called “the shortest presidential election in history.” Had she had more time to build her campaign — an opportunity denied by former President Joe Biden’s decision to keep running for re-election for a month after a disastrous debate performance — the election might have turned out differently, Harris said on Wednesday.
The then-vice president lost to Donald Trump in the popular vote and the electoral college. Her defeat ushered in an administration that is “corrupt, callous and incompetent,” Harris said.
Harris said she predicted what the administration would do, including efforts to eradicate the U.S. Department of Education and a widespread immigration crackdown. But she said she was caught off guard by the support President Trump has garnered from corporate leaders.

“I have predicted almost everything that’s happened,” Harris said. “But what I did not predict was the capitulation, the titans of industry, the powerful people who just bent the knee to the foot of a tyrant.”
Harris called the Trump administration’s agenda a “swift implementation of a plan that has been decades in the making.” She criticized what she said are economically damaging tariffs, the spread of disinformation and attacks on consumer protections.
At one point, when lamenting President Trump’s conduct and likening him to other demagogues, she appeared to confuse the home state of the white-supremacist politician Bull Connor, who is from Alabama.
“Mississippi knows it well, Bull Connor, I mean, we know, we have had figures throughout history that have been about destruction and have not elevated our best angels or our better angels,” Harris said.

The local crowd enjoyed a riff from Harris on the importance of participating in local government to help fix issues such as potholes, of which there are many in Jackson.
“Insurance doesn’t cover a flat tire,” Harris quipped. 
Harris’s late-December decision to launch the second part of her book tour in the Deep South, where Black voters typically play a key role in the Democratic presidential primaries, sparked speculation about her future. She spoke in New Orleans on Tuesday and will also make stops in the critical primary state of South Carolina, along with appearances in Tennessee and Alabama.
Harris did not discuss her future plans on Wednesday. But she has said she has not ruled out another run for the White House and did not say anything that would dissuade attendees from assuming that.
She recounted writing her 2024 concession speech on the way to Howard University, adding one line: “Sometimes the fight takes a while.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/14212923/kamala-harris-feat-image.jpg,,,2026-01-15 07:58:25.704415

Gov. Kay Ivey launched a statewide effort to expand the program to all 67 counties in 2023. The bill does not change the way the program operates but codifies an executive order signed by Ivey in 2023 to establish the statewide expansion of the Imagination Library.
Last year, Ivey released a statement saying over two million books had been distributed to children in all counties across the state. The statement also said over 106,000 students are enrolled in the Imagination Library program.
Under the bill, state funds will make up half of the program’s funding and local partners will make up half. Private donations can also be contributed to help fund the Imagination Library.
According to the bill, the Alabama Department of Early Childhood Education will manage the Imagination Library program and is also responsible for working with a nonprofit to operate the program and create rules as needed.

(Photo by Buena Vista Images/Getty Images)Octopus is back on the policy menu for Washington state lawmakers.
A bill to outlaw the sale, possession, transport, and distribution of farmed octopus advanced out of the House Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee on Wednesday.
“Octopus are intelligent creatures. They’ve shown aptitude for problem-solving,” said Rep. Adam Bernbaum, D-Port Angeles. 
He said the bill is not intended to limit the consumption of octopus or to prevent its use “in any number of culinary applications. But if we can make sure that its harvest is done in a more compassionate, less painful way with fewer ecological impacts, we should do so.”
The legislation, which stalled in the same committee last session, passed Wednesday on a party-line vote, with the panel’s six Democrats in favor and its five Republicans opposed. 
House Bill 1608 seeks to build on a 2024 law banning octopus farming in Washington. 
Rep. Tom Dent, R- Moses Lake, the committee’s lead Republican, agreed that octopuses are intelligent. But his colleagues had “some serious concerns” with the legislation and he had not “got into the weeds” to find ways to make it amenable.
When Washington enacted its prohibition on octopus farms, it was a preemptive move as there were none operating or proposed in the state at the time. Most octopus consumed in restaurants in Washington is wild because there are no large-scale octopus farms anywhere.
A 2021 study by researchers in England found “very strong evidence” that octopi are sentient beings capable of experiencing distress and happiness. An octopus farm would be tough on them, researchers concluded.
Rep. Strom Peterson, D-Edmonds, authored the 2024 law and sponsored this year’s bill.
It bars knowingly selling, possessing, transporting, or distributing “any species of octopus that is the result or product of aquaculture.” Violations carry a fine of up to $1,000.
“We’re following other states and other countries in trying to protect a pretty unique creature,” he said.
The legislation will be sent to the House Rules Committee, where lawmakers will decide whether to allow a House floor vote on the bill.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/octopus-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 07:58:25.704415

Garrett Bascom, R-Lawrenceburg, (second from right) would establish new procedures to ensure defendants with intellectual disabilities are not sentenced to death. (Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)An Indiana House committee unanimously advanced a bill Wednesday tightening protections for defendants with intellectual disabilities in capital cases, while a Senate proposal allowing firing squad executions remains on hold as lawmakers approach key legislative deadlines.
Other death penalty-related bills filed this session have yet to receive hearings. 
Legislators have just two weeks to move legislation to the House and Senate floors. Bills must advance from committees by Jan. 26 and to opposing chambers by Jan. 29.
The House Courts and Criminal Code Committee on Wednesday unanimously advanced to the full chamber House Bill 1432, authored by Rep. Garrett Bascom, R-Lawrenceburg, which would prohibit the state from seeking the death penalty against a defendant if a court determines at any time before trial that the defendant has an intellectual disability.

Under current law, the court must make that determination within a more narrow, early pretrial window.
Bascom told committee members the bill is intended to address a procedural gap — not alter Indiana’s long-standing policy barring execution of people with intellectual disabilities.
“It doesn’t change anything substantive,” Bascom said. “What we’re attempting to do here is make sure that anybody with an intellectual disability does not fall through the cracks in the process.”
Bascom noted that defendants currently must raise intellectual disability as a defense no more than 20 days before the omnibus date, which can arrive quickly after charges are filed.
“When I was a public defender,” he said, “sometimes it can be difficult to really get your feet underneath you” within that short window.
Before voting, the committee approved additional language in the bill that creates an automatic process to evaluate defendants for intellectual disability once prosecutors seek the death penalty.
Bascom explained that after the state files notice of intent to seek a death sentence, the court would appoint at least two independent evaluators to assess the defendant. Their reports would initially be shared only with defense counsel.
“After the review of the second report, then they will have 30 days to raise the defense and then the judge has to decide this before trial,” Bascom said. “I’ve attempted to bring all the stakeholders together to come into the sweet spot so that we don’t have anybody fall through the cracks as it relates to the death penalty, and as it relates to somebody that specifically has this intellectual disability.”
Examples of intellectual disabilities include, but are not limited to, persons with Down Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder.
‘Straightforward and important’
Tom Crishon, with The Arc of Indiana, testified in support of the bill as amended, calling its purpose “straightforward and important.”
“The purpose of the bill … is to ensure that individuals with an intellectual disability are not subjected to the death penalty in Indiana,” he said. “This has long and properly been the policy of the state and reflects federal constitutional law.”
Crishon said Indiana’s current statute prioritizes procedural deadlines over accuracy.
‘A fail-safe option’: Lawmakers debate firing squad executions in Indiana

“Intellectual disability can manifest in different and often subtle ways,” he added. “It is not always obvious at the onset of a case.”
Crishon additionally said the bill does not presume a finding of intellectual disability, but instead ensures the issue is affirmatively considered by qualified professionals.
“Ensuring accuracy at the onset is not only constitutionally sound, but is fiscally responsible,” Christian said.
If defendants in active capital cases are determined to have an intellectual disability early in proceedings, the state could save an estimated $260,000 per case in public defense costs alone, largely because death penalty cases require two attorneys and higher reimbursement rates, according to a legislative fiscal analysis.
Counties could also avoid hundreds of thousands of dollars in jury trial and indigent defense expenses.
The Indiana Catholic Conference also voiced support. Roarke LaCoursiere, speaking on behalf of Indiana’s Catholic bishops, said the bill adds “an additional measure of scrutiny” in capital cases.
“Although the Catholic Church teaches that the use of the death penalty is inadmissible in all cases,” Lacoursiere said, “we are here to offer support for House Bill 1432.”
Public defenders urge caution
The Indiana Public Defender Council testified in neutrality but cited concerns from capital defenders about the bill’s automatic evaluation process.
Zach Stock, appearing on behalf of the council, said efforts to reduce error in death penalty cases are critical, including errors related to intellectual disability, mental health and sanity determinations.
“The error rate is unacceptably high,” Stock said. “Anything that could attempt to reduce that error rate is something that we should appreciate and champion.”










If an evaluation gets away from a defender, and it’s not done right — not done well — they’re tainted for years.


– Zach Stock with the Indiana Public Defender Council


However, he said capital defenders worry the process could “make it worse by complicating their control and potentially tainting” evaluations through what he described as the “anchoring effect,” where early assessments influence later conclusions.
“If an evaluation gets away from a defender, and it’s not done right — not done well — they’re tainted for years,” Stock said.
Bascom acknowledged those concerns and said he would continue working with public defenders as the bill moves forward.
Firing squad bill remains on hold
A separate death penalty proposal in the Senate stalled this week, however.
Senate Bill 11, authored by Sen. Mike Young, R-Indianapolis, would add execution by firing squad as an option under Indiana law. The bill was heard in committee last week and placed on the Senate Corrections and Criminal Law Committee agenda for Tuesday, but committee chair Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, declined to amend or vote on it.
In brief comments during Tuesday’s meeting, Freeman made clear that “Indiana is a death penalty state … and as long as I have a say, Indiana is going to continue to be a death penalty state.”
He warned, though, that efforts to eliminate capital punishment through litigation or other avenues could backfire.
“For those of you that disagree, fine, good. People can disagree, and we can do so respectfully,” Freeman said. “I would just say this — be careful what you wish for, because it just might come true the more you want to try to eliminate something.”

In comments to the Indiana Capital Chronicle after the hearing, Freeman said he would “prefer for executions to continue to happen by lethal injection,” which he called “the most humane,” but said he has not decided whether the bill will be called for a vote next week.
Freeman said he recently met with the Indiana Department of Correction, which he said raised “some concerns,” though he did not provide details.
Noelle Russell, a spokesperson for the Department of Correction, told the Capital Chronicle the agency has no position on the bill, currently. The department has not testified publicly on the proposal.
Several amendments to Senate Bill 11 have been filed but have not been taken up by the corrections committee.
One amendment would authorize DOC to carry out executions by firing squad only if the commissioner determines it is “advisable in light of availability considerations and the resources of the department.” The proposed changes would also require the agency to establish a dedicated room and execution protocol before any firing squad execution occurs.
A new state prison is under construction in Westville, but it’s unclear if such a room is included — or possible — in current building plans.
Other death penalty bills without action
Several additional death-penalty-related bills filed this session have not yet been scheduled for hearings.
House Bill 1119, authored by Reps. Jim Lucas, R-Seymour, and Andrew Ireland, R-Indianapolis, would allow executions by firing squad or nitrogen hypoxia while keeping lethal injection as the default method unless an inmate requests otherwise.
Another Ireland proposal, House Bill 1314, would seek to speed up post-conviction relief proceedings, potentially shortening the time inmates spend on death row.
Separately, House Bill 1287, filed by Rep. Bob Morris, R-Fort Wayne, would require members of the General Assembly to volunteer to serve on execution teams and make their names public records.

I know she will bring that fight to Congress on day one and I am proud to support her run to represent NJ-11 in Congress,” Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement.
The winner of the Democratic primary will face Republican Randolph Mayor Joe Hathaway on April 16. The winner of that election will finish out Sherrill’s term, which ends Jan. 3, 2027.
Ocasio-Cortez’s support will help Mejia cast herself as the progressive leader in the race to succeed Sherrill, which includes former Rep. Tom Malinowski, Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way, Essex County Commissioner Brendan Gill, and Passaic County Commissioner John Bartlett, among others.
Mejia, who lives in Glen Ridge, was national political director for Sanders’ 2020 presidential bid, and is also the former executive director of the New Jersey Working Families Alliance. She called herself “humbled” by Ocasio-Cortez’s endorsement.
“It’s time to take power back from the political establishment and put it in the hands of the people and I’m ready to do that alongside Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to deliver real results,” she said.
Major names are weighing in on the special election. Sen. Andy Kim (D) has endorsed Malinowski, who represented the 7th Congressional District for two terms before being ousted in 2022. Gov. Phil Murphy (D) supports Gil, who managed Murphy’s 2017 campaign for governor. Way has secured the endorsement of another New York Democrat, Rep. Gregory Meeks. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka (D) backs Mejia.
The other Democrats in the race to succeed Sherrill are Army veteran and businessman Zachary Beecher, attorney and comedian J-L Cauvin, former Obama staffer Cammie Croft, Morris Township Committeeman Jeff Grayzel, Chatham Councilman Justin Strickland, and community activist Anna Lee Williams.
The 11th District includes towns in Essex, Morris, and Passaic counties.

Meeting that challenge will require discipline, market-driven solutions and a firm commitment to policies that strengthen, not restrict, the state’s energy supply.
Missouri consumes far more electricity than it produces. As demand increases from advanced manufacturing, agricultural processing and new technologies, and as older power plants retire, expanding in-state generation is no longer optional. It is essential to maintaining economic competitiveness and grid reliability.
That is why proposals to impose moratoriums on utility-scale solar are deeply misguided. A moratorium does not stop demand, it limits supply. When government restricts supply, prices rise. Blocking the lowest-cost and fastest-to-build source of new generation forces Missouri to rely more heavily on expensive, out-of-state power and volatile wholesale markets, directly increasing electricity costs for ratepayers.
The consequences extend well beyond utility bills.
Companies considering investments in Missouri look closely at energy availability and price stability. Advanced manufacturers and agricultural processors cannot expand, or even operate, without dependable, affordable electricity. Artificially constraining generation through a solar moratorium creates an energy shortage by government decree, putting Missouri at a competitive disadvantage to neighboring states that are expanding supply and welcoming investment.
Solar development has already proven its value in Missouri. More than $1.1 billion has been invested, generating $3.7 million in state and local tax revenue that supports schools, public safety and infrastructure, without raising taxes. In rural communities, these projects provide stable, long-term revenue at a time when family farms face increasing economic pressure.
Equally important, solar respects private property rights. Farmers and landowners who voluntarily choose to host projects are exercising their right to use their land productively, strengthen their operations, and diversify income. A blanket moratorium replaces individual choice with government control, undermining the principles of property rights and free enterprise that Missouri conservatives have long defended.
Solar energy is not a government mandate or a political statement; it is a practical tool. It is affordable, reliable, and can be brought online quickly to meet rising demand. Expanding solar strengthens grid resilience, keeps energy dollars in Missouri and reduces dependence on outside suppliers.
Missouri’s success has always been driven by innovation, private investment and respect for property rights, not by government-imposed scarcity. As lawmakers consider the state’s energy future, they should reject moratoriums and embrace market-based solutions that lower costs, protect landowner rights, and ensure Missouri has the power it needs to grow.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Panels2-scaled-e1768426687144-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-15 06:57:42.074710

Would any of the doctors be willing to help provide abortion services?
The responses were similar, said Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which operates the Columbia location. 
“Could this affect my practice?” the physicians asked. “Could this put me at risk?” 
No providers agreed to come on board, Wales outlined in testimony this week as part of a trial focused on the constitutionality of Missouri’s dozens of regulations on abortion clinics and providers.
Three days into the trial, witnesses have illustrated how layers of regulations enacted in recent decades by a legislature intent on pushing abortion from the state ultimately succeeded in “making compliance confusing or impossible, and abortion gradually unavailable,” said Eleanor Spottswood, an attorney with Planned Parenthood Federation of America.
The dearth of physicians willing to provide abortion services — and who could meet the state’s rules — played a significant role.
“There are very few abortion providers in the state of Missouri and this community in general,” Dr. Selina Sandoval, associate medical director at Planned Parenthood Great Plains, testified Wednesday. “We know that a lot of this is related to the criminal penalties and the constant harassment and threat that abortion providers are under. I experience this regularly, almost daily, when I’m working.”
Testimony has painted a timeline of providers often sent scrambling for support as they tried to gain or maintain licensure required through the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. By 2022, when a near-total abortion ban went into effect in Missouri, there was no longer any point.
In late 2024, Missourians enshrined abortion protections in the state constitution. Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri sued the state a day later with the goal of striking down a few dozen abortion regulations they say are now unconstitutional under the new amendment. 
Last year, Jackson County Judge Jerri Zhang, who is presiding over the bench trial, agreed to temporarily block some of the regulations until a final conclusion could be reached at trial. This allowed Planned Parenthood to again begin providing procedural abortions at three locations: Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis. Medication abortions remain unavailable due to regulations that remained in place ahead of trial.
Missouri abortion regulations go on trial Monday. Widespread access is at stake

Among the myriad abortion regulations passed by the state legislature over the years is a requirement that only physicians perform abortions. 
Lifting this requirement and allowing advanced practice clinicians, including nurse practitioners, would double the number of abortion providers in the state, and could pave the way for offering abortion at additional Planned Parenthood clinics, Wales said in her testimony. 
Another law requiring physicians to have admitting privileges and a transfer agreement at a local hospital has also greatly inhibited Planned Parenthood providers over recent years, providers testified.
In 2012, the Columbia clinic employed two doctors with admitting privileges at two local hospitals. But both ultimately left the clinic, Wales said, because of harassment. Protestors showed up at one doctor’s home, she testified. They also showed up at the other doctor’s private practice.
Similarly, Wales testified, Planned Parenthood tried and failed to recruit a specialized sonographer to either its Kansas City or Columbia clinics after a new state statute requiring these more skilled and more expensive professionals be used.
Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood’s relationship with the state health department became increasingly “combative,” Wales testified, saying that both planned and surprise on-site health inspections intensified over the years. Some staff resigned as a result, Wales said.
Sandoval’s testimony detailed how hospitals are wary of giving abortion providers admitting privileges because of politics and OBGYNs fear potential criminal penalties if they provide abortions. 
Until the passage of the reproductive rights amendment, health care providers who performed abortions not deemed necessary under Missouri’s emergency exception could be charged with a class B felony, which means up to 15 years in prison. Their medical licenses could also be suspended or revoked.
By the time the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion in June 2022, there was only one clinic in Missouri still providing abortions.
Dr. Margaret Baum, chief medical officer with Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, based in eastern Missouri, Springfield and Illinois, was among the last doctors providing abortions there when Roe v. Wade was overturned.
Baum knows the risks. When she walks into work, she said protestors have called her name, as well as her husband’s, who is also an abortion provider. They have plans in place for their children in the event they are ever both prosecuted. 
“When these laws came into place, we had a very serious discussion about whether or not we could continue to provide abortion in Missouri,” she testified.  
The trial, which is expected to span 10 days, returns for the fourth day of testimony on Thursday. Attorneys for Planned Parenthood are expected to call more clinic employees to the stand.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_8060-e1768445179450-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-15 06:57:42.074710

(24th Judicial District photo)A Jefferson Parish judge who has been chosen king of a Carnival krewe can spend his campaign money on events surrounding his role, according to the Louisiana Board of Ethics.    
The board issued its decision Friday for 24th Judicial District Judge Adrian Adams, who reigns over the Mystic Krewe of Music this year. Adams, who is up for reelection this year, had sought an advisory opinion from the board confirming that his Mardi Gras expenses could be covered with campaign money. 

Specifically, Adams asked if he could use political contributions to purchase cups, beads and other carnival favors bearing his name and image to be given out at parades and other Mardi Gras festivities. 

“If I am able to use the funds, it will allow me to meet the constituents of Jefferson Parish,” Adams wrote in his request for an advisory opinion. 
The board agreed Mardi Gras paraphernalia could be a legitimate campaign expense. 
“[The law] does not prohibit you, as a candidate, from using contributions for expenditures related to Mardi Gras items, including cups, beads or carnival favors, provided that the items contain your name and image,” ethics administrator David Bordelon wrote in the approved opinion. 
A handful of older board opinions issued in the late 1990s already indicated Mardi Gras parade throws with the names and images of politicians on them were a legitimate campaign expense. 
The ethics board might be getting more requests for clarification because the Louisiana Legislature recently loosened restrictions on campaign spending for Mardi Gras. 
In previous years, the board prohibited using campaign funds for Carnival krewe membership dues and participation in parades if the elected official or candidate’s face was covered. But a broad rewrite of the campaign finance laws last year means those spending limitations likely don’t exist anymore. 
Politicians may now use their campaign and political action committee money for krewe dues as long as being a member of the krewe helps them interact with constituents, other elected officials or former elected officials. 
There’s also a specific provision to allow campaign money to be spent more freely on Washington Mardi Gras, which takes place in the nation’s capital every year. 
In November, the ethics board issued an advisory opinion to Mandeville Mayor Clay Madden, stating he can legally use campaign funds to cover his Washington Mardi Gras expenses. Madden intends to go to the event, which will take place the last week of January, in his official capacity as a city representative, he said in his request to the board.

Private equity firms have in recent years bought out some of the few school transportation companies available to school districts, sparking worries among advocates.

Years ago, when the Mountain Views Supervisory Union would bid for student busing services, officials would get several competing offers to pick from, the district’s superintendent recently pointed out.
Now, the district is lucky if they get a single bid, Superintendent Sherry Sousa said. And they’re not alone.
Over the past decade, Vermont has seen fewer and fewer companies available for student transportation services, according to interviews with school superintendents and administrators, and a report by the Vermont Agency of Education.
This has limited school districts’ ability to negotiate contracts at competitive prices. The Agency of Education’s report, released in December, highlighted the “rapidly rising and unpredictable cost of transportation services, driven in part by limited vendor competition.”
In a survey of supervisory unions and supervisory districts last year, officials described year-over-year cost increases ranging from 20 to 35 percent, “with some projecting even steeper future growth,” according to the agency’s report.
Without competition in the market, Sousa said it “makes it really hard to negotiate a contract that meets the needs of our communities and is fiscally responsible.”
Now, with the Legislature’s focus on education reform, transportation will almost certainly be on lawmakers’ minds. Act 73, Vermont’s generational effort to reform the state’s public education system, calls for consolidating the state’s 119 school districts and the 52 governing units that oversee them.
But it’s anyone’s guess what that consolidation could look like, or if lawmakers will even agree on a proposal. Issues with transportation will only make that endeavor more difficult.
Meanwhile, the few school transportation companies operating in the state have been bought up or are controlled by private equity companies.
At least four companies that are contracted with school districts in Vermont — including First Student, Butler’s Bus Service, Bet-Cha Transit and Mountain Transit — are owned by private equity companies, sparking worries about service quality among advocates.
Compounded by a general shortage of drivers, the state of the industry has made busing students all the more difficult, particularly for school districts in more rural areas.
“I think this is one of those sleeper issues,” said John Castle, the executive director of the Vermont Rural Education Collaborative and a former superintendent of the North Country Supervisory Union. “You contract out with a mega company that can do this. But how responsive are they to your needs? And at some point, when they control the market, they’re gonna jack up the price, and you’ve got very little say in what you can do.”

‘Not a whole lot of providers’ 
Vermont’s school districts are required by state law to adopt a school transportation policy but are not required to provide student transportation. 
The school districts that do provide transportation can get funding from the state’s transportation reimbursement grant program. Districts may apply to get 50% of their transportation costs covered but are limited by a statewide cap of about $25 million.
With a lack of competition, districts are left negotiating with companies from a position of limited leverage, contributing to disproportionately high per-student costs, according to the Agency of Education’s report.
It’s not clear how many school bus companies operate in the state, or how many districts offer transportation services. The Agency of Education does not track which school bus companies contract with school districts, nor does the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles, which manages the inspection of school buses and issues licenses to drivers.
One prominent company operating in Vermont is First Student, the largest student transportation service provider in the country, which was purchased by the private equity firm EQT Infrastructure in 2021 in a $4.6 billion sale.
First Student is contracted with the Washington Central Unified Union School District, which serves students in Berlin, Calais, East Montpelier, Middlesex and Worcester.
Steven Dellinger-Pate, the district’s superintendent, said First Student’s service has been satisfactory, but he is concerned with the lack of competition in school bus vendors.
“There’s just not a whole lot of providers in Central Vermont,” Dellinger-Pate said. “We have not always had other vendors bid for transportation contracts in the past, so, you know, we certainly appreciate competition where it exists, but we don’t always have that in our transportation bids.”
First Student spokesperson Brenna Rudisill wrote in a statement that the company is operating all planned routes and actively recruiting to offer competitive wages and benefits to increase staffing levels to continue to meet daily service needs. First Student and EQT Infrastructure did not immediately respond to subsequent inquiries on scant vendor competition and the impact of private equity on the student transportation landscape.  
Brooke Olsen-Farrell, superintendent of the Slate Valley Unified Union School District, said only one company, Bet-Cha, responded to the district’s last two bids for service. This is despite the supervisory union hiring a transportation consultant to drum up more bids across the Northeast, she said.
Olsen-Farrell said her district faces similar school bus workforce challenges and concerns with lack of vendor competition identified by the Agency of Education’s report.
“This year seems to be a little better than previous years, but there’s many years where we have had to combine runs (or) cancel runs due to lack of drivers,” Olsen-Farrell said.
Bet-Cha is owned by Student Transportation of America, which is owned by pension fund managers La Caisse and Ullico, according to Student Transportation of America spokesperson Mitun Seguin. 
Student Transportation of Vermont — the company’s arm here — works with 30 districts and communities, either through direct contracts or through the local divisions Student Transportation of America owns and operates: Bet-Cha Transit and Mountain Transit. 
La Caisse and Ullico both invest in private equity globally. But “unlike traditional private equity investors,” Seguin wrote, the pension funds have long-term interest in investments made — like Student Transportation of America’s operations in Vermont. 
There are “pocket areas of shortages” for bus workers, but Student Transportation of Vermont has invested in recruiting and retention efforts and has maintained adequate levels of staff, and Seguin rebuffed claims of a shrinking school transportation vendor pool. 
“It is important to note that there is, and always has been, competition among privately owned student transportation companies in Vermont,” Seguin wrote. 
Orleans Central Supervisory Union contracts with Butler’s Bus Service, which in January 2025 was purchased by Beacon Mobility, a national company operating in 25 states that is backed by private equity firm Audax Private Equity.
Jacquelyn Ramsay-Tolman, the Orleans Central superintendent, said staffing and scheduling problems caused routes to be canceled around four times in the first weeks of the school year.
Butler’s Bus Service representatives were communicative through the challenges, and route cancellations issues have since been resolved, although bus staffing for afterschool activities remain a concern, Ramsay-Tolman said.
Sousa, the Mountain Views Supervisory Union superintendent, which is also contracted with Butler’s Bus Service, said her district, too, has had trouble staffing routes due to a shortage of drivers.
Sousa said Butler’s is the only game in town. While she said the company is reliable, difficulties often arise due to driver shortages. The district was unable to support a school bus route for two months due to labor shortages that “put a huge pressure on families and on the school.”
“There are times, at least once a week, where a driver calls out sick, and within hours we have to inform families that there will not be a bus route,” she said. “It really makes it hard for our families when we don’t have the resources to meet the commitment we’ve made to those families.”

Private equity’s impact
Private equity’s presence in the market has generated concern among advocates and school officials around the quality of service available to school districts. Some fear it could magnify workforce shortages and the small vendor pool. 
Azani Creeks, a labor issues researcher and campaigner for the nonprofit Private Equity Stakeholder Project, said the trend is part of an emerging pattern at public schools of outsourcing and privatizing systems like health care, data management and food services to private-equity-affiliated companies.
Private equity companies have been investing in the student transportation sector for at least 15 years, Creeks said, according to tracking by the Chicago-based watchdog organization.
She pointed to a National Education Association article that argued that private outsourcing of student transportation negatively affects student safety and community accountability.
Employees often experience a shift in working conditions when private equity takes over, and private-equity-backed companies employ union busting tactics at higher rates, Creeks added.
Bus workers for the transportation company Travel Kuz experienced this firsthand. The company, which has a contract with the Windham Southeast Supervisory Union, locked out its Vermont workers right before this school year started at the end of August.
Travel Kuz — which was formerly called F.M. Kuzmeskus — was acquired by private-equity-backed firm Beacon Mobility, in 2022. Beacon Mobility did not respond to an email request for comment.
The union bus workers and the company eventually came to an agreement but only after nearly two weeks of an escalating labor dispute.
Since the purchase, the Vermont bus workers who the Teamsters Local 597 union represents saw worsening conditions and operations before the contentious contract negotiations, according to the Vermont Teamsters Local 597 President Curtis Clough.
“The way they operate came with the private equity fund, because F.M. Kuzmeskus was a very, you know, tightly run, very organized company a few years ago,” Clough said. “They were starting to pay late. They started to pay the wrong rates. They started to not give people raises on time. They started to charge the wrong amount for health care.”

‘Dependability of our transportation system’
While many districts contract out transportation services, some Vermont school districts, like South Burlington and Champlain Valley, operate their own systems — albeit not without their own workforce challenges.
Jean-Marie Clark, the South Burlington School District’s director of finance and operations, said having an in-house fleet with drivers on staff allows the district a certain level of flexibility and control that they may not get with a third-party company.
“It feels like we are in control of what’s happening and what routes are running and what routes aren’t running, as opposed to that being told to us,” she said.
Staffing shortages remain a persistent issue, officials said, although some districts have found more stability after they increased wages.
Gary Marckres, the chief operating officer with the Champlain Valley School District, pointed to the “stability and quality” provided by having drivers on staff. His district pays first-year drivers a starting wage of $37 an hour, while drivers with the South Burlington school district who have been employed for more than a year make $39.46 an hour, Clark said.
“I’m not saying that the contracted bus drivers are bad, but these are our drivers and mechanics — they’re our employees,” Marckres said. “They’re part of that team that helps us engage with students. They have consistent routes. They know the kids by name. It’s really about engagement and quality and dependability of our transportation system, which I think is the largest advantage.”
But for many districts in the state, operating a fleet or keeping drivers on staff is not a financial reality.
For years, the Colchester School District owned its own fleet of school buses, according to Amy Minor, the district’s superintendent. But she said they eventually moved away from owning their fleet to save money. They now contract with Mountain Transit, one of the local divisions operated by Student Transportation of America.
In the Mountain Views Supervisory Union, Sousa said operating its own school busing system would require a full-time employee. The district would also have to weigh the cost of depreciation and maintenance on a fleet of vehicles — something the district wouldn’t be able to afford.
In labor leader Clough’s mind, the lack of school bus vendors has an upstream cause: school districts’ practice of choosing the lowest bidder.
By solely looking at price, Clough said the districts make it more difficult for smaller transportation businesses to compete and makes it more likely the smaller company will be bought out by larger firms that may have private equity ties — shrinking the pool of vendors further. 
The cost of owning and maintaining buses and establishing depots is a “hurdle” for smaller companies starting up in the state and submitting a bid for a student transportation contract, Olsen-Farrell, the Slate Valley superintendent, said.
While the contracts may cost more, Clough said local, smaller bus companies’ bids may be better in other ways, like providing better services and wages for workers. This, in turn, may help in recruiting bus workers during an ongoing labor shortage.
“You can get yourself in a situation where you’re creating an uncompetitive environment, because the only thing that the bus companies have to concentrate on is cost,” Clough said. “We need to be willing to invest in local companies to do this.”

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)At the Wisconsin Farmers Union annual farm and rural lobby day on Wednesday morning, the organization’s members heard about how antitrust policy, environmental regulation enforcement and immigration law are affecting the state’s farmers. 
About 90 farmers union members sat around tables in a conference room at the Madison Public Library before heading to the Capitol to push their legislators on the group’s 2026 priorities. 
Gov. Tony Evers addressed the group in a kick-off address, discussing  what his administration has accomplished and what it plans to do moving forward as the “chaos and confusion” of the federal government under the Trump administration “continues to make an already strenuous job harder.” 
“Regardless of what happens in Washington, here in America’s Dairyland, we’re going to keep fighting for Wisconsin farmers and producers and their families because Wisconsin’s agricultural industry isn’t just core to our economy, it’s core to our culture, core to our heritage and who we are as a state,” Evers said. 
Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul addressed the group next to discuss how the Department of Justice is working to help the state’s farmers, noting the DOJ was involved in the lawsuit to keep federal food benefits available during the government shutdown last year.
He also discussed the DOJ’s work to protect fair markets and evenly enforce the state’s environmental rules to make sure that the state’s largest corporate farms are playing by the same rules as its smallest family operations. 
“One area that we are engaged in is ensuring that the market is fair, that there’s competition, and ensuring that there’s a level playing field for everybody to compete on. To me, that is fundamental to a lot of what we do,” he said. “So one way is regarding consumer protection. Another area where we take that very seriously is protecting our environmental laws and ensuring that the environmental laws in the state are evenhandedly enforced, because, as you all know firsthand, if massive corporate farms are able to cut corners, that puts them at a major competitive advantage, and all the farms that are out there doing the right thing, very carefully complying with rules and regulations that are in place. If the rules aren’t evenly enforced, that puts the small farmers, often small businesses, at a major competitive disadvantage.” 
Immigration crackdown
Among the farmers union’s top legislative priorities this year is protecting immigrant farm workers. 
On immigration, the organization said it is lobbying legislators to oppose a bill that would require all Wisconsin sheriffs to join the federal government’s 287(g) program, which grants sheriff’s deputies some authority to enforce federal immigration law. Under the bill, if counties refused to participate, the state would reduce the amount of shared revenue provided to the county by the state by 15%. 
Across the state, 18 sheriff’s offices have entered 287(g) agreements, including Kenosha County, which signed its contract to hold immigrants in its jail on behalf of ICE last week. 
The organization also wants to support a bill that would allow DACA recipients — people whose parents brought them to the country without documentation when they were children — to obtain occupational credentials such as licenses to practice medicine. 
In a panel on immigration policy, Amanda Martinez, a policy analyst at Kids Forward, said 287(g) can cause fear to spread throughout rural immigrant communities. 
“This could really deeply impact rural communities who already have those smaller budgets, and also impact the immigrant workers within local communities, because they are a big part of the workforce, whether it’s at farms [or] food productions,” Martinez said. “Bills like 287(g) and Assembly Bill 24 really creates that fear in communities, because immigrants don’t want to go to work, take their kids to schools, and can’t really participate in everyday life, and essentially will impact the workforce as a whole.”
Kaul was asked to respond to the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis and criticized the ICE activity that led to the shooting death of Minneapolis resident Renee Nicole Good, and the exclusion of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension from the investigation of that incident.
Attorney General Kaul says Minnesota ICE action harms public safety

Cottage-industry food makers
The Farmers Union is also opposing a bill that would regulate cottage foods makers in a way that advocates said would effectively kill the industry — which was only launched after a lawsuit in 2017 changed existing state law. The bill under consideration this year would require the business owner to use a commercial kitchen if their annual revenue exceeds $40,000. 
Advocates said this limit makes it impossible for these businesses to survive because $40,000 per year isn’t enough to support a family and the cost of renting commercial kitchen space, in communities where that’s even available, would make it harder to turn a profit. 
“If you do revenue of $40,000 your take home or profit is not going to be that, and it is not a living wage, and there is no amount of business you can do and put in an energy that is going to make this a sustainable business, even as a value-add product for farmers,” Jobea Murray, a Milwaukee home baker and president of the Wisconsin Cottage Food Association, said. “The amount of effort and time you put into this.

Members of the Joint Appropriations Committee split Wednesday over whether to put the quarter of a billion dollars into temporary or permanent savings accounts. 
The post Wyoming lawmakers clash over where to stash $250M in surplus revenue appeared first on WyoFile .","Amid ongoing budget fights over spending, Wyoming lawmakers clashed Wednesday on the proper way to stash a quarter of a billion dollars in savings.  
While Wyoming Freedom Caucus lawmakers called for placing $250 million of excess revenue into temporary savings to retain the ability to spend it at a later date, others supported Gov. Mark Gordon’s recommendation to put that amount into permanent savings, where it would remain inaccessible but would generate spendable investment income in perpetuity. 
Tensions have run high this week in Cheyenne as the primary budgeting arm of the Wyoming Legislature has been meeting at the Capitol to write a draft budget bill ahead of next month’s legislative session. Debate has largely centered on cuts, including unprecedented measures to dismantle the Wyoming Business Council and halt state dollars from funding Wyoming Public Media. Lawmakers also voted to axe $40 million from the University of Wyoming’s block grant and to strip tens of millions from the state’s health department. 
The driver of such cuts? Not a financial deficit, but a desire by a newly empowered group of Republicans, known as the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, to reshape state government. 
“We’re going to do everything we can to limit the growth of government, so it does not outpace your paychecks,” Joint Appropriations Committee Co-Chairman John Bear, R-Gillette, said at a Freedom Caucus press conference in November.  
The caucus has criticized previous legislatures for stowing revenue in permanent savings. Those past decisions recently led to a record $1.86 billion in investment earnings, surpassing state revenues from the mineral industry. 
Even so, Gordon urged lawmakers to “significantly increase our savings, which are invested so as to bring additional revenue to the state,” he wrote in a Jan. 7 letter to the Joint Appropriations Committee. 
“As you know, these earnings from our savings continue to help defray the costs taxpayers would otherwise have to pay to receive the services the legislature has required under the law,” Gordon wrote. “Consequently, setting aside savings from current surpluses facilitated during President Trump’s administration better sets the state up to mitigate against harder times.”
Gordon proposed lawmakers evenly split $250,000,000 into two permanent savings accounts — the Wyoming Permanent Mineral Trust Fund and the Common School Permanent Land Fund. Both savings accounts earn investment income, the former of which provides “significant stability for the operations of our state government and statutorily mandated services to our citizens,” Gordon wrote. 
“This income is now one of the top three sources of revenue for the state and, at times, has been the number one revenue generator. This keeps taxes low and provides a quality of life for residents,” Gordon wrote. “Thanks to the wisdom of these former legislators and governors, Wyoming has not been faced with the prospect of being broke in 25 years. That specter was not unfamiliar before that.”

Bear sought an alternative. He brought a motion Wednesday to place those dollars in the state’s “rainy day” fund, officially titled the Legislative Stabilization Reserve Account, or LSRA. 
The fund is consistently ranked as the nation’s largest state reserve as a share of its operating cost. And while it also earns investment income, unlike permanent savings, lawmakers can dip into the account principal — not just the investment income it generates — to cover expenses. 
“There are many arguments to be made that the Legislature is far too liberal about spending this money down the road, and it should be protected by putting it in a constitutionally protected account, which is what the governor has recommended,” Bear said. “But as I look at the long-term forecast with the potential of being in deficit spending on education, I think it’s important that the Legislature have funds available in the next two years, especially in the next four years, to be able to meet those needs in education funding, where this money being tied up in permanent savings would not be available to this body.”
Sen. Ogden Driskill, R-Devils Tower, spoke against Bear’s motion and pointed back to 2020 when the state was facing a $400 million budget shortfall. 
“We’re sitting on one of the biggest sovereign wealth funds in the nation, and our budget’s balanced with yet another year of excess money,” Driskill said. “We’re not arguing like I did back when we cut $400 million [that] we didn’t have.”
In response, Bear pointed to the committee’s attempt to spend less money and a forthcoming ballot initiative to cut residential property taxes — which fund local governments and education — by 50%. The reduction would be in addition to the 25% exemption lawmakers already put on the books. 
“What I’m proposing would help to keep local governments, which I’ve heard my colleagues across the aisle say is just draconian, what we’re doing to local governments, that they can’t afford these 2% to 5% cuts,” Bear said. “Well, there’s gonna be bigger cuts if people vote to relieve themselves from some tax burden.”

Bear’s comments piqued the interest of Jackson Democratic Sen. Mike Gierau. 
“We just got the tell right there. If you ever play cards, you always look for the tell. And there it was,” Gierau said. “Because we’re going to cut taxes and we’re going to need that money for spending.” 
The income that Wyoming’s investments generate “staves off the pain of the bust that we had time and time again,” Gierau said, speaking against Bear’s motion. 
“This is one of the most consequential decisions that we’ll make in this budget. Say you want to save, but you don’t want to save for the future. You want to hold this money out because you may want to spend it on something else,” Gierau said. “Well, I tell you what, when people in my party say that, they get called all kinds of names.” 
Rep. Jeremy Haroldson, R-Wheatland, asked the committee to understand that both options are savings and to find a compromise. 
“Ultimately, I think maybe we need to wake up to the fact that we can maybe achieve both ways and not just draw lines in the sand on this one,” Haroldson said. “Frankly, I’m frustrated.”
Before Bear’s motion passed, he told the committee that approximately $500 million is already statutorily earmarked for permanent savings. 
The committee will meet again Thursday to complete crafting the draft budget ahead of the session that begins Feb. 9. Once the budget bill reaches the House and Senate floors during the session, it’s subject to debate and amendments from the full Legislature.

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Legislation beefing up Indiana’s employment eligibility verification law no longer threatens violators with a yearlong ban from public works contracts following major edits Wednesday.
Instead, the reworked Senate Bill 87 offers employers — that, acting in “good faith,” misidentify a worker as eligible to work or vice versa — immunity from civil liability.
“This is a strong … statement proclaiming that Hoosier tax dollars invested in public works project will only be spent on legal workers,” said Sen. Linda Rogers, R-Granger.
Indiana employers face yearlong public works contract ban under immigrant work eligibility bill

Rogers brought a significant amendment before the Senate’s Pensions and Labor Committee, which she chairs. It was taken by consent.
The legislation explicitly extends the state’s existing E-Verify requirement to all public works projects, regardless of the construction delivery method. Witnesses previously complained of “loopholes” allowing certain construction managers to “self-perform” checks.
Rogers called the provision an “important” expansion of the state’s “commitment to being accountable to taxpayers.”
Before their employees begin work, contractors would have to provide the entity that hired the company with a notarized affidavit affirming they don’t knowingly employ unauthorized workers, and run employees working on the project through E-Verify.
The internet-based federal program cross-checks a new hire’s eligibility to work in the U.S. The system compares information from the employment eligibility Form I-9 to records maintained by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration.
Contractors would have three business days to provide an E-Verify number for specific employees upon the hiring entity’s request.

In response to concerns prime contractors would be responsible for their sub-contractors’ mistakes, Rogers’ amendment specifies the requirements apply to a firm’s direct employees.
Contractors would be prohibited from employing people that don’t pass E-Verify muster, although workers would be able to join the project later if they get a valid number.
A yearlong public works contracting ban for firms that “knowingly or intentionally” violate the bill was nixed in favor of a safe harbor provision for those “acting in good faith” — another response to critical testimony last week.
Current law offers 30 days to remedy violations but otherwise directs state agencies or local units to cancel the contracts. It also includes a rebuttable presumption that employers didn’t knowingly hire an unauthorized worker if the person came up clear in E-Verify.
Senate Bill 87, Rogers said, “dramatically expands the utilization of E-Verify in public works while maintaining an environment in which … contractors have the ability to do great work without undue administrative burdens.”
It was approved unanimously and now heads to the Senate floor.

(Photo by Tom Davies/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana’s cities and towns would have the option of moving their elections to even-numbered years under a bill advancing in the Legislature.
A House committee’s endorsement Wednesday of the optional proposal comes after a failed attempt last year to shift the next round of municipal elections — now set for 2027— to presidential election years starting in 2028.
The House elections committee delayed taking action on another bill that would require most counties to draw county commissioner districts so that they have roughly equal populations.
Moving municipal elections
Supporters of last year’s effort to change the city and town election years argued the shift could increase voter turnout and decrease costs by pairing municipal races with federal and state contests.
Rep. Jennifer Meltzer, R-Shelbyville, raised those considerations in presenting House Bill 1055 to the committee but emphasized moving municipal elections would be a local decision.

“Only having an election once every other year instead of three out of every four, might be the right thing for your community,” Meltzer said. “So leaving all of that up to the local elected officials to make their own decisions and determine what is best for them, not forcing them to move their elections.”
Committee member Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, cited concerns about local issues “getting lost in the noise” of federal and state campaigns if city elections are moved. 
A study led by the Indiana secretary of state’s office last year concluded that moving the municipal elections would lead to a boost in voter turnout that would “more than mak(e) up for” votes lost through “ballot fatigue.” That’s when voters lose interest in lengthy lists of choices.
Indiana’s cities and towns organization expressed opposition to the bill, although the group’s lobbyist said some municipal leaders support the move.
Amy Krieg, the government affairs director for Accelerate Indiana Municipalities, said the group worried about a diminished focus on local issues if the elections for mayors and other city offices were shifted.
“When those elections are moved to even numbered years, the conversation always, or typically, turns into the national hot topics,” Krieg said.
Committee members voted 9-3 to advance the bill to the full House for consideration.
County commissioner districts
The committee put off any action on House Bill 1342 that would require most counties to draw residency districts for their three county commissioners so that they “contain, as nearly as is possible, equal population.”
Bill author Rep. Tim Yocum, R-Clinton and a former Vermillion County commissioner, said that in some counties “the balance is totally out of whack and it needs to be in some way justified.”
Supporters of the bill testified about situations in Clay and Knox counties where one commissioner district has more than 17,000 residents and the other two have fewer than 5,000 residents.
Bill opponents argued that such variations don’t violate “one man, one vote” standards because while commissioner candidates must live in their districts, those positions are elected on a countywide ballot.
The bill would apply to all counties with a board of commissioners, except Lake and St. Joseph counties that currently elect commissioners by district rather than countywide.
Tyler Warman, executive director of the Indiana County Commissioners organization, argued that rural residents “would lose their voice in county government” if commissioner districts were based on population alone.
“For example, Johnson County has a northern urban district, a suburban central district and a rural southern district. Many counties have a similar map,” Warman said. “… It allows for representation from each part of the county. If population alone dictates these districts, one city could hold all seats on the board of commissioners.”

(Getty Images)The Wisconsin Department of Children and Families Sec.-designee Jeff Pertl told reporters that he is confident in the state’s child care accountability measures and isn’t concerned about the state potentially losing federal funding. 
Last week, the Trump administration froze over $10 billion in federal child care funds designated for Minnesota and four other states amid fraud allegations. The funds cover child care subsidies, social services and cash support for low-income families. 
Pertl told reporters that “nothing can stop the president from politicizing an issue.” 
“I think we all see that playing out in a variety of ways all across the country right now, and I think that concerns everyone frankly,” Pertl said. 
Even with the politicization of the issue, Pertl expressed confidence in Wisconsin’s system. 
The Wisconsin Shares program is a subsidy program for low-income families where funds are paid to parents on an EBT card that is then used to pay a child care provider. According to the agency, this program is the main way that federal child care funding is utilized in Wisconsin. There is also some funding that goes towards quality improvement for programs, training and technical assistance.
Pertl said January payments have already gone out to families and he said he doesn’t expect any issues with February payments or other future payments. 
“People are using them. Folks should have confidence in the system,” Pertl said. “We’re likely to see an increase, maybe, in reporting requirements, but our system is well positioned to be able to meet those and continue to move forward. It may be administratively burdensome, and maybe more paperwork and things we’ve got to collect, but we’re confident that our system, particularly because of its unique history, is probably one of the best systems in the country for being able to navigate some of the questions that are coming in.” 
Wisconsin dealt with significant fraud involving improper payments a decade ago, which led to the state beefing up its accountability measures. 
A 2009 Pulitzer prize-winning investigation by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel uncovered fraud within the WisconsinShares program that led to criminal indictments and prompted the state to implement protections. 
An audit that year by the Legislative Audit Bureau found there was an estimated $16.7 to $18.5 million in improper subsidy payments made and child care providers were estimated to have received an additional $4 million in improper subsidy payments as a result of errors or fraudulent reporting.
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester), who was in the Legislature at the time, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in December that he remembers the work that was undertaken to address the issue in 2009. 
“I want to definitely make sure it’s not happening again,” Vos said. He noted that he hasn’t heard of specific examples of fraud happening, but he doesn’t “want to assume that it’s not.”
Gov. Tony Evers also told reporters this week that Wisconsin is “in a good place.” 
“There’s lots of auditing going on… so I think we’re in a great place,” he said. 
Some of the reforms that the state has adopted relating to ensuring proper payments include expanding program integrity staff, improving attendance tracking and reporting, implementing fingerprint background checks, expanding the list of crimes that prohibit someone from running  a child care center, adopting YoungStar, which is the quality rating system in the state, and moving to using EBT cards. 
The state has also passed laws to allow DCF to collect money from providers if they go out of business and to suspend or revoke licenses and subsidy payments to people previously convicted of crimes relating to the operation of a business. 
Those measures can help ensure accountability.
“How do you know when it’s fraud? How do you know when a kid just stopped showing up?” Pertl asked. “When we do the licensing visit or get a tip or we’re checking the enrollment and attendance records, if there’s discrepancies… that’s going to trigger a review. It might trigger a claw-back and recovery of money.”
Wisconsin DCF also maintains a list on its website of child care centers that have been suspended or terminated from the WisconsinShares program. 
The federal government conducts monitoring checks every three years. In recent years, Wisconsin has had a low payment error rate. In 2023, the last time the check happened, Wisconsin’s error rate was 2.9%. In 2020, it was 1.81% and in 2017, it was 4.35%. In 2013, the error rate was 18.84%. 
Pertl noted that the changes made by the state were a bipartisan effort under the administrations of former Govs. Jim Doyle, a Democrat, and Scott Walker, a Republican. 
“There are certainly some very significant issues going on in Minnesota and there is no question that the president politicizes this for an agenda and targets folks for it,” Pertl said. “I think what you’ve seen [Gov. Evers] say and what you see Wisconsin leaders doing is showing that we have a strong system that has navigated these issues, that has high integrity, that addresses these things when they come, and so we’re confident about our ability to continue to run a robust and great child care system.”

Jim Pillen. Dec. 27, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Gov. Jim Pillen, while pressing the Nebraska Department of Economic Development in 2024 to tighten its belt, steered the state agency to award a $2.5 million no-bid emergency contract to a bioeconomy consultant and lobbyist he knew and had traveled with as part of state delegations. 
State Auditor Mike Foley alleges the Economic Development Department, in carrying out that Pillen-picked contract, broke state law by not specifying in writing what emergency justified skipping the required step of bidding out contracts worth more than $50,000, a step meant to save taxpayers money.
In a Jan. 6 audit letter Foley shared with the Governor’s Office, which was obtained by the Examiner and authenticated by the auditor, Foley dinged the department for leaving blank a required section for explaining the emergency on the state’s “Procurement Exception/Deviation” form.
Nebraska State Auditor Mike Foley. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)
That’s where department personnel must explain the circumstances justifying seeking no bids. Foley criticized the agency for leaving the second page of the May 2024 form blank, writing that it “contained questions regarding the reasons for designating the contract as an emergency.”
Foley’s letter alleges that omitting this information meant the contract did not comply with “the legal requirement to specify the nature of the supposed exigency” under the Nebraska State Procurement Act in Nebraska Revised Statutes 73-815. 
That section of state law requires the agency to provide the “justification of the emergency” and requires the state to “retain a copy of the justification with the contract in the state agency files.” Violating that law carries no criminal or civil penalty. 
According to Foley, the designation of the contract “as an ‘emergency’ is unsupportable.” The absence of a bidding process, Foley alleged in the letter, resulted in a $2.5 million contract for Global Sustainability Developers LLC, “a company handpicked rather than selected through the ‘time-honored’ and legally required open, competitive process.”
“I think it’s critically important, because competitive bidding is a bedrock, foundational tenet of government operation,” Foley told the Examiner of his findings. “When you sidestep a foundational tenet, it’s just waving a huge red flag for any public auditor. It smacks of favoritism.”
Contracting with GSD
Nebraska awarded the $208,333-a-month, remote work contract in May 2024 to GSD, a Lincoln firm that at the time had a single employee — owner Julie Bushell, a lobbyist with agricultural and telecommunications connections who also leads Ethos Connected, an agribusiness firm using sensors to wirelessly connect farm and ranch infrastructure, including water.

The state contract with GSD called for Bushell’s firm to drum up more bioeconomy business in Nebraska, including by accessing more federal funds for such developments.
Nebraska’s contract with GSD was the Department of Economic Development’s largest emergency no-bid contract since the COVID-19 pandemic, the Examiner found and state officials confirmed. 
It was far larger than a typical emergency no-bid contract, with some notable exceptions during the pandemic, based on a recent legislative performance audit of state handling of emergency contracts. The median emergency no-bid contract in Nebraska between 2014 and 2024 was about $350,000, it found.
The auditor’s report, as well as Examiner reporting, make plain that Pillen’s office recommended the contractor on behalf of the governor. Pillen’s chief of staff, Dave Lopez, was among staffers involved in the process, based on records and messages obtained by the Examiner. Chiefs of staff often communicate with state agency leaders.
DED leaders did not know firm
State correspondence indicates that top Economic Development Department leaders did not know the firm they were contracting with when the contract was awarded, based on the Auditor’s Office letter and backed by months of interviews, public records and reporting by the Examiner that started before learning of the auditor’s probe.

But Pillen knew Bushell’s work. She had joined Pillen on state trips to South Korea and Japan, records indicate. She also joined some state delegations when Pillen visited Washington, D.C. Both attended the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. A photo obtained by the Examiner shows Pillen and Bushell together at the 2024 Ak-sar-ben ball, held by a charitable foundation of business leaders.
To the Examiner, the Governor’s Office denied playing favorites. 
Foley said Pillen told him when they talked during the audit that he himself had recommended Bushell. 
The auditor said the governor, in the same conversation, described the decision as a joint one between Pillen and the DED director at the time, K.C. Belitz.
Emails between then-DED leaders, including Belitz, show the Governor’s Office’s involvement in the contracting process. Belitz did not return calls or messages seeking comment, but his correspondence says the language of the contract was “vetted thru Julie [Bushell] and the Governor.”
Governors hire and fire the leaders of many state agency departments, including the Department of Economic Development.
Belitz resigned in June 2025. Pillen replaced him with his general counsel for the Governor’s Office, Maureen Larsen, who also previously served as deputy director of Pillen’s Policy Research Office. 
“I’ve been in the [Capitol] building 25 years, 11 years as an auditor, and I can’t recall anything that had the direct involvement of the governor,” Foley said. 
Contract facts
Of about 4,200 contracts entered by the state in each of the past two calendar years, 22 in each year were emergency contracts for which the state sought no competitive bid, according to the Nebraska Department of Administrative Services, the state’s clearinghouse for such contracts. 
Under the Nebraska Procurement Act, DAS is “the sole and final authority on contracts for personal property by a state agency,” including for no-bid emergency contracts.

Including the GSD contract, only five of the state’s 44 emergency no-bid contracts over the past two years left the justification blank, DAS says. Three of the five were DED contracts, officials said. Two were on behalf of DAS itself. 
From mid-2020 through 2025, the Department of Economic Development signed a total of four emergency no-bid contracts, officials said. Two paid six figures. One was for five. GSD’s was for $2.5 million.
Pillen’s team blamed a former DED attorney for not adding the legal justification to the GSD contract and the others. But Pillen-led DAS signed off on the GSD contract without the justification, copies of the contract indicate. 
Lee Will, director of the Department of Administrative Services, said last week that the state contracting office, after Foley’s audit, had revised its Deviation Form to make clearer that the justification section must be filled out and added a step to its processes to make sure the required box is completed.
Foley said he would like his office to join the process. State Sen. Bob Andersen of Sarpy County introduced Legislative Bill 997 Tuesday on Foley’s behalf that would require an additional copy of state no-bid contracts, including emergency no-bid contracts, to be filed with the State Auditor’s Office, in addition to the agency and DAS.

The Governor’s Office, over several days last week, told the Examiner Pillen recommended contracting with Bushell because of her business connections, leads on potential development projects and experience in maximizing how much federal money Nebraska could secure at the end of the Biden administration. 
Pillen spokeswoman Laura Strimple said the Governor’s Office has supported two emergency no-bid contracts “when the Legislature passed requirements to engage vendors in a certain timeframe, and the cumbersome procurement process would not have met the deadline.” 
Both have helped taxpayers, she argued, and “delivered overwhelming value to Nebraska.” One was the DED contract with GSD. Another was a $10 million, four-year state contract with Utah-based Epiphany Associates and the Department of Administrative Services to help DAS use technology to find potential “systemic cost savings across state government.” 
“The bioeconomy contract delivered hundreds of millions to Nebraska, and the DAS cost-reduction effort continues to produce lasting reforms in cost-cutting efforts for the state,” Strimple said.
The Epiphany contract drew legislative scrutiny during the 2024 session, including questions from state senators about whether leadership of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services should have disclosed previous ties to the company.
Governor’s Office: Bushell helped state get funds
Team Pillen says Bushell’s business, GSD, helped Nebraska secure $550 million in federal funds — about $200 million of which have yet to arrive. Among the funds mentioned, the administration says Bushell helped the state secure $33 million in U.S. Department of Agriculture funds for Affordable Clean Energy Loans to Sandhills Energy and Bluestem Energy Solutions and $10.3 million in Rural Energy for America grants and loans. 
The $200 million USDA New Era grant to Nebraska Electric G&T is the part that had not yet been disbursed, Foley’s letter says.

Pillen’s staff also credits Bushell with a pledged investment of at least $5.5 billion to build a cornstalk converting biofuels plant in Phelps County, in the Holdrege area. 
Former Phelps County Development Corporation director Ron Tillery called Bushell’s help vital. 
Tillery said Pillen suggested during a visit to Phelps County in July 2024 that local economic development officials should meet with Bushell if they were serious about pursuing a sustainable aviation fuel plant, which locals wanted as a means to carve out a market niche in a world of ethanol and biodiesel plants.
Kenny Zoeller, who leads the Governor’s Policy Research Office and spoke for Pillen’s team, said Bushell came recommended by Nebraska business leaders and “Aksarben,” which is often shorthand in political circles for a group of statewide business leaders sometimes loosely tied to the Omaha-based Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben organization.
Three people with ties to the group questioned whether its leaders would recommend a contractor for a state bioeconomy consultant, and more than one said Pillen had introduced members of the group to Bushell. Bushell joined the group’s board in mid-2024, archives of the foundation’s website show. 
Bushell, in a sit-down interview last week, echoed the Governor’s Office in saying the economic benefit to Nebraskans of her work helped the state obtain more federal money than it might have otherwise. She said her contacts in the bioeconomy space helped land planned projects like Phelps County’s DG Fuels plant.
The Pillen administration, through Zoeller and Will, argued that Bushell’s work helped Nebraska secure nearly $290 million more in federal funds than a per-capita projection of what the state should expect to receive. 
“I think the deliverables of this contract speak for themselves,” Bushell said. “I am incredibly proud that the world knows that Nebraska is the leader in bioeconomy, and in an economic position that the state’s in now. I think it’s really important that we continue to grow and invest in these projects.”
Foley argued that the administration’s per-capita number ignores that most such federal projects run through more complex formulas that consider much more than population. He noted in his audit letter that “other states received comparable amounts of the same grant and loan monies, presumably without any involvement by GSD.”

Questions about DG Fuels
Foley’s audit letter also questions whether Nebraska and Phelps County economic development officials are banking on a $5.5 billion DG Fuels project that might not be built.
The audit team dug into 11 announced DG Fuels projects in 10 states since 2001, seven of which pledged investments of more than $1 billion. The Foley letter indicates that none of the DG Fuels projects his team reviewed has yet been built to completion, although the audit shows several of the projects have made progress.
Among them: a sustainable aviation fuel plant planned for the former Loring Air Force Base in Maine, where the audit said ground was expected to be broken in 2026, and a 2024 announced project in St. James Parish, Louisiana, which expects to start producing fuel in 2028.

Washington, D.C.-based DG Fuels, a biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel developer, did not return multiple Examiner attempts over several days to reach the company by phone and email. 
Michael Darcy, the owner of DG Fuels, originally agreed to sit down with Foley’s team, the auditor said. But Foley said Darcy and his company cut off communication before the two met, after Foley communicated that he planned to question the progress of projects in other states.
Bushell said Nebraska needs to be careful not to create an environment that costs the DG Fuels project. She and Tillery say the project is making more progress through the state and local permitting process. Bushell said DG Fuels told her the Nebraska project is among its top priorities. 
Foley’s audit letter also highlights that Bushell sought in October 2024 to amend the conflict-of-interest provision of her state contract so she could negotiate with DG Fuels about possible future work after the state contract ended. She did not respond to the Examiner’s follow-up questions about that push via text or email.
DED, with the Governor’s Office’s knowledge, approved the contract change. Will, in a statement to the Examiner, said the department “felt the revised terms would not lead to a conflict of interest.”
“In short, there was no risk for a conflict of interest, because there was no funding to create a conflict while under state contract,” Will said.
Foley said such conflict of interest language is meant to protect taxpayers and that he had unanswered questions about Bushell’s push to negotiate with a private company she had been working with on the state’s behalf.
“The Phelps County project is one of the trophy projects that supposedly came from this [contract],” Foley said. “There were a number of federal grant awards that they say came because of GSD. … When our auditors looked into it, other states were able to get similar amounts.”
Too little time?

Foley, in his letter, wrote that DED had enough time “to search for a qualified service provider in compliance with statutory competitive bidding requirements” for the $2.5 million bioeconomy contract that went to GSD.
But Zoeller and Will pushed back, arguing that Legislative Bill 1412, the mid-biennium budget bill, left the state too little time to act when it took effect in early April 2024. 
The bioeconomy provision in the budget bill required DED to coordinate work aimed at bioeconomy development, seek federal grants, and it gave the agency 15 months to report back on its progress. The law did not require immediate spending or entering into a contract.
The Governor’s Office pointed to the law’s requirement for a status report on the new bioeconomy initiative to the Legislature by June 30, 2025. According to Zoeller and Will, issuing and evaluating requests for proposals takes up to 60 days, followed by an RFP protest period of up to 50 days, which meant completion without the emergency approach could have taken up to 110 days.
But Foley said because the Governor’s Office sought that section of LB 1412, the Department of Economic Development had early warning and could have started its processes sooner to be ready to go out for bids and could have sought requests for information to gauge interest sooner from potential bidders.
Contract obligations questioned
Foley’s questions about the contract stretched into how little it required of GSD in terms of reporting how the firm spent state money. It did not require itemized receipts of expenses or time sheets. It required only the submission of monthly invoices summarizing the work done and dollar amounts, he said.

Those invoices largely say Bushell’s firm helped introduce state and local leaders to bioeconomy developers, scheduled and attended meetings, lobbied federal agencies and contacts, reviewed and discussed grant applications and communicated with project planners.
Will said that, while Foley was right that many state contracts are stricter with reporting requirements for the spending of state funds, some state contracts with consultants, including many in economic development, leave more flexibility to let consultants spend the funds more nimbly.
The State of Nebraska pushed to end Bushell’s contract two months early, at the end of February 2025. Zoeller told the Examiner the change in presidential administrations meant that Nebraska and Pillen had a more direct relationship with the Trump administration and no longer needed GSD’s connections. Foley said he started requesting information about the state contract in mid-January 2025.
In the end, the state paid Bushell’s firm $2.08 million. What Nebraska got for that money, Foley said, remains unclear. Pillen’s team says the state got a more than reasonable return on its investment.

Though dissatisfaction with the agency has been brewing for years, Gov. Gordon says he'll fight to preserve the state's primary economic development shop.
The post Stakeholders contemplate demise of Wyoming Business Council appeared first on WyoFile .","The fate of the Wyoming Business Council remains unclear following the Joint Appropriations Committee’s vote this week to defund the state’s primary economic development shop.
The committee informally agreed to consider sponsoring a bill that would presumably dismantle the Business Council statutorily. But the bill draft, as of Wednesday, had not been made public, and it’s unclear how far such an effort might go to reconfigure or reassign state economic development programs.
The legislative budget session begins Feb. 9.
If the Business Council is dismantled without a replacement, Wyoming might be the only state in the nation without a state-level economic development agency, proponents of the organization warned.
Though Gov. Mark Gordon said the committee’s defunding action “can be reversed during the full legislative session,” some economic development professionals say they’re prepared to work with the Legislature to reimagine how the state moves forward without the Business Council.

“It is clear that parts of the current economic development framework are not working as intended,” Wyoming Association of Municipalities Executive Director Ashley Harpstreith said in a statement to WyoFile. “Local economic development is ultimately about building and sustaining communities where businesses can locate, grow and remain competitive. That work starts with infrastructure and community readiness, not solely with programs or initiatives.”
Top of mind, according to Harpstreith and others who spoke with WyoFile, is maintaining vital programs like the Small Business Development Center, jointly administered by the Business Council and University of Wyoming.
“The most effective statewide economic development is going to have to prioritize empowering communities with the tools and resources they need to be ready for opportunity,” Harpstreith said.
The Business Council directly employs 38 full-time workers and two part-time workers, with an annual benefit and payroll of $5,894,845, according to the agency.
Council criticism
Dissatisfaction with the Business Council has been stewing for years, another economic development professional told WyoFile. The organization’s particular shortcomings, they said, depend on who you ask.
“We’re not finished yet. The full Legislature is going to come in, and they’ll have a conversation.”Amy Edmonds, Gov. Gordon’s office
The agency does not help everyone who comes knocking at its door, Business Council Chief Executive Officer Josh Dorrell has testified to Wyoming lawmakers. Through an application process, the agency chooses from a pool of applicants with legitimate needs for state help. The appearance of picking winners and losers has made Dorrell “unpopular” in some Wyoming communities, he’s said.
In August, for example, Dorrell pitched a proposal to a legislative committee to increase the mandatory dollar match for the Business Ready Community grant and loan program from a varied scale to a flat 25%. The “controversial” move, he said, was intended to concentrate state dollars in communities that demonstrated the most bang for the state’s buck. It also aligned with what Dorrell perceived lawmakers were asking of the Business Council, he said. Intrinsically, the move would exclude communities that couldn’t afford the higher match. It was a tradeoff that, “from an economic standpoint,” Dorrell said, made sense.
The Legislature’s Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee declined to take up the measure.

But frustration with the council extends beyond any one particular program, Harpstreith said. Essentially, the organization has become too bureaucratic to effectively connect with businesses and communities.
“Over time, emphasis has leaned toward programming and administrative approaches, while flexible, direct investment in infrastructure and community development has not kept pace,” Harpstreith said. “What is missing is consistent, meaningful partnership around infrastructure and community-level capital. Without that foundation, even well-designed programs struggle to produce real, lasting economic outcomes.”
If not the Business Council, what?
If the Business Council is eliminated without a replacement, Wyoming — technically — might be the only state in the nation without a state-level economic development agency, according to several sources.
But that distinction comes with a lot of nuance.
“[Economic development] work starts with infrastructure and community readiness, not solely with programs or initiatives.”Ashley Harpstreith, Wyoming Association of Municipalities
Wyoming, like every state, would still rely on various federal agencies such as the U.S. Economic Development Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which help meet myriad needs, including rural development, housing and food security. Other federal agencies, like the Environmental Protection Agency, offer funding for water systems.
In terms of other “homegrown” economic development agencies in the Cowboy State, there is the Wyoming Energy Authority, which administers things like the Energy Matching Funds program.
The Office of State Lands and Investments is also integral to many aspects of economic development. Somewhat unique to Wyoming, the office’s Mineral Royalty Grants program — funded via a stream of revenue from coal, oil and natural gas royalty payments — used to be a powerhouse source to help communities meet infrastructure needs. But the program has shrunk in pace with decreasing mineral revenue payments.
For now, Gordon is not entertaining the potential demise of the Business Council or concepts of how Wyoming might forge ahead without the organization.
“The governor wouldn’t have made the recommendations he did if he didn’t support economic development and the Wyoming Business Council,” his Communications Director Amy Edmonds told reporters during a Wednesday briefing.
“We’re not finished yet. The full Legislature is going to come in, and they’ll have a conversation,” Edmonds said.

Renee Nicole Good's killing in Minneapolis compelled columnist David Romtvedt to ask, what is the place of poetry in a troubled society?
The post Poetry and the news appeared first on WyoFile .","I was working as a planning and budget analyst for the State of Illinois when I received notification that I’d been accepted into the Washington State Artist in Residence program. This was the beginning of my work in K-12 schools helping young people write poetry. I also worked in a Senior Center where we started a poetry workshop with 10 senior citizens and 10 high school sophomores. I don’t know which group felt more nervous about the other. I watched them come to understand one another better, write more insightfully, and gain in both critical capacity and compassion.

Opinion

It was very moving and yet something nagged at me: I worried that poetry was trivial. No one much reads it. And what good does it do? William Carlos Williams said, “It is difficult to get the news from poems, yet men die miserably every day for lack of what is found there.” 
OK, but poetry feeds no hungry families. Poetry cures no disease. It ends no war. Williams was a doctor as well as a poet. Perhaps I should have been a lawyer. That’s what I thought. I was young. But I stuck with poetry and have written and published it now for 50 years. It’s too late for the law.
In the past few days, following the shooting by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer of Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis woman, I’ve thought again about the place of poetry in a troubled society. Ms. Good, poet, mother, citizen is now dead. As a student at Old Dominion University, Ms. Good received the Associated Writing Program poetry prize. Her award was for “On Learning to Dissect Fetal Pigs,” a poem about the struggle to understand the place where science and faith meet. The narrator has donated Bibles to thrift stores, both the Bibles “plucked from street corners from the meaty hands of zealots” and those that don’t go by the name Bible, those with “the slick rubber smell of high gloss biology textbook pictures; they burned the hairs inside my nostrils.” 
In high school biology class, I too was asked to dissect fetal animals and I too struggled to find where the soul resides. In Ms. Good’s poem, it’s “maybe there in between my pancreas and large intestine.” She called it the “piddly brook of my soul.” As the poet does, I too asked if faith and science could exist together: “this fickle faith and this college science that heckles from the back of the classroom.”
When I was a student at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, I submitted a poem for the Associated Writing Program competition. This was at the end of the Vietnam War. We were scarred by President Nixon’s lies and torn apart by both violent and nonviolent protests. National Guard troops had shot and killed students at Kent State University, while the police had shot and killed students at Jackson State University. My poem tried to stay away from politics. I didn’t win the prize, but did receive an honorable mention. I was just happy to be done with the war. 
Now here’s Renee Nicole Good, shot dead in her car by ICE agents going door to door trying to round up people who may or may not be undocumented residents of the U.S., who may or may not have committed a crime. 
I’ve watched several videos taken by both ICE agents and bystanders. It’s clear Ms. Good was neither threatening nor attacking anyone. As she backs up, an ICE agent grabs the driver’s side door of the car, saying, “Get out of the fucking car.” Another agent steps around in front of the car from the passenger’s to the driver’s side. Moving forward, Ms. Good turns to the right, away from this second agent, who pulls his gun and fires one shot through the windshield. As the car continues to turn away from him, he fires two more shots through the driver’s side window. Ms. Good’s car then crashes into the back of a nearby parked car. A bystander runs toward the scene; ICE agents look around, offering no aid. Then the agent who shot Ms. Good walks to the crashed car and, after a few seconds, turns back, telling his colleagues to call 911. Another bystander, his hands raised above his head, speaks:
“Can I go check a pulse?”
“No. Back up. Now.”
“I’m a physician.”
“I don’t care.”
That’s the poem of the day. In poetry, irony is a widely used writer’s device. Only it’s usually not so brutal.

The post Keeping the Republic: Franklin’s test for modern Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","As a small-town newspaper publisher, I’ve always considered it my mission to shine light on local government because I firmly believe citizens have a fundamental right to know what their government is doing for them — or to them. That principle is non-negotiable for those who understand the value of an informed citizenry and the importance of accountability for elected officials.

Opinion

Over the past year, the Wyoming Press Association proposed a draft bill to close loopholes in the Wyoming Public Records Act and make it more likely that officials who abuse the law will face consequences. We lobbied aggressively for this measure, and in November, the Legislature’s Joint Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee voted 13–0 to sponsor the bill for the session that begins next month. That rare unanimous endorsement sends a clear message that lawmakers recognize something needs to change.
As we pushed for reforms to deter secrecy, we readily acknowledged that many local governments already go above and beyond to keep citizens informed. These leaders don’t just follow the law — they embrace it. They welcome scrutiny, communicate openly and treat transparency as a public service, but they were not being recognized for it.
That’s why the Wyoming Press Association created the Benjamin Franklin Award for Open Government. This monthly recognition honors Wyoming’s most transparent local governments. Awards will be given through 2026 in conjunction with the state’s observance of the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. This honor highlights agencies that partner with their local press and make good faith efforts to share information, conduct public business in the open and empower citizens.
The award is named for the pioneering printer and publisher who famously declared to citizens that he and the other Founding Fathers had created “a republic, if you can keep it.” Franklin’s warning indicated that citizens would have to be informed and engaged if the new republic was to survive, and that admonition is as true for Wyoming today as it was for the United States nearly 250 years ago.
The first recipient of the Ben Franklin Award is Converse County, whose officials were nominated by Matt Adelman, publisher of the Douglas Budget and Glenrock Independent. He cited their consistent and proactive approach to informing the public — from publishing more public notices than legally required to using multiple forms of media to update residents regularly on projects like major roadwork.
Converse County provides a model for how government can work with the media to keep citizens in the loop, and our intent is that their recognition will inspire others. We hope that transparency will prove to be contagious, but we remain certain that recognition alone will not change Wyoming’s culture when it comes to open government. That’s why we will continue to push for legislation that promises to close existing loopholes and introduce real consequences for bad actors.
This two-pronged effort will allow us to both celebrate the good and deter the bad, and we encourage statewide associations that serve local governments — like the Wyoming Association of Municipalities, Wyoming County Commissioners Association, and Wyoming School Boards Association — to partner with us in motivating their members to commit to greater transparency. We encourage them to nominate officials or boards who are “doing it right” for this recognition, and the Wyoming Press Association welcomes the chance to hold open conversations with their boards, share best practices or make presentations about transparency to their members.
We believe the most meaningful way for Wyoming to celebrate 250 years of “keeping the republic” is by renewing and reinforcing our shared commitment to informing and empowering the state’s residents to be more engaged citizens and more knowledgeable voters. This award is obviously a “carrot” meant to move local governments in that direction, but it will ultimately be meaningless and ineffective if the corresponding “stick” isn’t created to encourage compliance with the state’s open government laws. That will be up to the Legislature, and we encourage citizens to let their representatives know that transparency and accountability are important to them.

(Photo by PeopleImages/Getty Images)Indiana’s Senate Education Committee on Wednesday advanced two bills aimed at reshaping how young Hoosiers interact with technology — one that would restrict minors’ access to social media platforms and another that would require schools to strengthen technology plans and give parents greater control over at-home device use.
Senate Bill 199, authored by committee chair Sen. Jeff Raatz, R-Richmond, passed the panel 11-2 and was recommitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee, where it must be approved before moving to the full chamber.
Democrats Sen. Andrea Hunley, D-Indianapolis, and Sen. Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington, were the only “no” votes against the social media.
The measure contains multiple provisions, but a highly-discussed section would substantially restrict minors’ access to social media. Under the proposal, social media companies like Meta would be required to obtain written parental permission before a minor under age 18 could create an account.
A bill with similar social media restriction language passed the Senate in the 2025 session but ultimately stalled in the House.

Supporters argued in committee that the bill is a response to growing concerns over social media’s impact on children’s mental health and school environments. 
Indiana Secretary of Education Katie Jenner emphasized the toll she said social media is taking on students across Hoosier schools.
“For most of us in the room, social media arrived when we were already well into adulthood,” Jenner said, adding that “our children growing up today do not have that same luxury” of a childhood free from constant comparison, cyberbullying, algorithm-driven content and addictive features.
But critics raised concerns about enforcement, privacy and rights of students. 
Samantha Bresnahan with the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana, for example, argued that such restrictions could infringe on minors’ constitutional rights and require intrusive data collection to verify age and consent.
Parents get more say
Senate Bill 159, authored by Sen. Spencer Deery, R-West Lafayette, takes a different tack on technology.
The measure, which passed the education committee 12-1, would require Indiana’s traditional public and charter schools to include in their technology plans a description of how they will enable parents to exercise control over school-provided devices when they are not in school and strengthen internet use and wireless communication policies.
If approved, schools must adopt policies by Jan. 1, 2027, that would let parents increase the strength of content filters on school-issued devices and limit the time students can use those devices outside school hours. The bill also directs schools to prohibit use of school equipment “for noneducational purposes during instructional time.”

Hunley was the lone vote against the proposal.
“I think that our school boards can already do this if they would like to,” she said. “I’m a big fan of home rule and local control, and I think that the level of government that’s closest to the school building should be the one to make this decision and enact this policy, not the state.”
Sen. Stacey Donato, R-Logansport, voted in favor but urged additional consideration of how parental controls might apply during e-learning days. 
“We talked about the parental controls on an e-learning day, that (parents) may not want a YouTube video or a TikTok or pick-your-poison that may be used in structure for the educational experience,” she told Deery. “I just encourage you to look into that.”
Democrats also pressed for clarity on potential costs to schools. 
Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis, asked whether districts might need to spend money to implement stronger parental controls. 
Deery said his office could not identify any examples where Hoosier schools would take on additional costs because most already contract with vendors that offer such functionality. “
We’ve yet to find any institution that does not have a contract with a vendor that does not offer this,” he said. “I’ve confirmed with virtually all of the major vendors. So, I’m not aware of (any costs schools would incur).”

After five decades of protecting North Idaho’s forests and water, the Kootenai Environmental Alliance has a new focus: making climate change feel local.
Over the past year, KEA has ramped up efforts to translate abstract climate data into terms North Idaho residents can see and act on. The strategy includes publishing local climate impact reports, partnering with the Coeur d’Alene Tribe on environmental education and launching creative community events — including a film series.
“After explaining carbon fee and dividend a dozen times only to see people’s eyes roll, I realized, it’s got to be local. People have to see the impacts for it to resonate,” said Dave Muise, KEA board president.

Founded in 1972 and incorporated as a nonprofit in 1974, KEA is Idaho’s oldest nonprofit conservation group. For more than 50 years it has worked to protect the region’s land and water as development pressures increased, challenging illegal timber sales and influencing land-use planning.
Now the organization is focusing on climate conservancy, advocacy and education — and finding new ways to make the case for action.
 Local data, local impact

The centerpiece of KEA’s climate education effort is the Coeur d’Alene Climate Adaptation Project, published in May 2024 by KEA’s Climate Action Team. The report documents rising temperatures in Coeur d’Alene at a rate that cannot be explained by natural cycles.
“It can be explained by including human impact on our environment, specifically the burning of fossil fuels, and the resulting increase in greenhouse gas concentrations (GHG) in our atmosphere,” Muise said.
Coeur d’Alene is not an anomaly; globally, the three hottest years on record since temperature tracking began in 1850 are 2024, 2023 and 2025. Kicking 2016 out of the top three.
Climate data can often feel abstract — until its impact is made clear on a local level.
While living in northern California, Muise was introduced to the Citizens’ Climate Lobby, a nonprofit, nonpartisan, grassroots advocacy climate change organization focused on national policies to address the national and global climate crisis. He liked the idea of taking action as a country by putting a tax on carbon emissions. Muise, a former nuclear engineer who spent 30 years in telecom equipment, resonates with climate policy on a national level, and the numbers behind it.
Muise said the Coeur d’Alene Climate Adaptation Project was inspired in part by the idea that people are more likely to change their behavior when they can see the impacts of climate change in their own communities.
The CCAP report specifically looked at the impacts of climate change already occurring in their hometown. The report includes historical data and future projections.
“There are two things that probably resonate the most with people. One is the chart. There’s a temperature chart that has kind of a worst case scenario in red, and then a best case scenario in blue, and then we’re going to end up somewhere in there. Do we know where? No, it just ain’t good no matter what,” Muise said.
The second are the trickle down impacts. Muise said when people hear that the temperature in Coeur d’Alene has risen a couple degrees, most think, “big frickin deal,” but in the CCAP they are faced with the direct impact.
For example, more of the region’s precipitation is falling as rain rather than snow. As snowpack shrinks, runoff comes earlier and rivers and lakes warm, increasing the risk of drought and wildfires and placing added pressure on agriculture. Warmer waters also fuel toxic algae blooms, an issue Coeur d’Alene Lake knows well, while exposing a more unique threat.
“As oxygen levels drop, heavy metals from legacy mining in lake sediments can go back into solution in the water. Put it all together … hotter summer days; warmer streams, rivers, and lakes; a greater risk of harmful algae blooms; heavy metals in the water; threats to fisheries; and more wildfire smoke — and it all threatens our tourism economy, which drives the local economy,” Muise said.

Muise presented the findings of the CCAP report during the first North Idaho Green Summit in 2024.
“After that, I was invited to join the KEA board,” Muise said.
In their current work they continue to focus on protecting natural resources, climate conservancy, advocacy and education. They’ve put this into practice while collaborating and learning from other local groups.

Work between KEA and the Coeur d’Alene Tribe has taken place through education, policy and public outreach events surrounding the environment and more specifically Coeur d’Alene Lake.

“That’s been really helpful on our side because that is a goal for us, to get our message out there. We want to make sure that our lake and our environment as a whole is protected and taken care of,” Matheson said.
Muise also notes how the collaboration has been helpful to KEA’s Climate Action Team. Muise and the Climate Action Team drove down to Plummer, Idaho, to learn more about sustainable energy utilized by the Tribe for its senior housing.
“We actually went down to Plummer, Idaho, and visited with Laura Laumatia — she’s involved in climate resiliency — and it was super nice to see right where she works there are solar panels on the roof. What really intrigued me was each apartment had its own heat pump, which is considerably more efficient, providing both heat and air conditioning,” Muise said.
One of KEA’s focuses includes narrowing in on smaller lakes around the region.
“What really is being impacted is the smaller lakes, and KEA is in the process of trying to work with some of the watershed commissions. An issue that we have is watershed commissions are primarily made up of people who own property around a lake. What we don’t have is these associations talking to each other, working together,” Muise said.
Muise said that this work can often be a double-edged sword: bringing awareness to declining lake health.
“Yes, the current homeowners are very aware of it, but do they want to sing it from the rafters? No, because it might affect their property values. So they don’t want to talk about it, or they don’t want to talk about it as much as I would think they would want to,” Muise said.
Despite some resistance, KEA will be kicking off the Small Lakes Commission in the spring.
 Kootenai Environmental Alliance engages community with creative events 

KEA has come up with creative ways to connect with the community. One such event is its annual Junk2Funk fundraising event. It’s a fashion show event where all of the outfits must be at least 80% garbage.
Janet Torline, KEA board vice president, came up with the idea years ago. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the event was slow to come back, and took a few cancellations before restarting in 2024.
Junk2Funk 2025 was held on Oct. 18, 2025. “Artists were asked to focus their works on Air, Fire, Water and Earth,” Cynthia Rozyla, board director and treasurer said. (Photo by Gen Heywood/FāVS News)
The event is organized by a dedicated committee, which has grown in membership as the event regained momentum post-pandemic. Each year the group selects a distinct event theme. Board Director and Treasurer Cynthia Rozyla is the event’s committee chair and main organizer.
Rozyla said the first year after the pandemic the event resumed, they had to focus on just jumping back in. Then on Oct. 18, 2025, KEA had their second Junk2Funk event post-pandemic. The event’s theme was “The Elements” where artists were asked to focus their works on Air, Fire, Water and Earth.
KEA uses the funding from these events toward the organization’s expenses. This includes conservation initiatives for lakes and forests, educational programs for students and the broader community, organizing events and building partnerships with other regional environmental organizations.
Another event offered for the first time in early November was the Green Screen Series & Eco Film Forum. Three panelists spoke after the film’s completion, one of which was Aiyanna James, climate resilience coordinator for the Coeur d’Alene Tribe.
Muise said he chose a relatively positive film in part because he fears like-minded people who support climate action are discouraged.
“That’s what I want to fight. If I can stop three people from being demoralized, I will feel that it’s been a success.”
The film series event featured “Trashed,” a documentary about wasteful human consumerism, its negative impact, and how around the world waste reduction is, and can be, successfully achieved. The event took place on Jan. 10 at 2 p.m. in the Community Room at Coeur d’Alene Public Library.

(Photo: Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)Seven years ago, the revelation that Tennessee had stockpiled $732 million earmarked for low-income Tennessee families drew a near-universal outcry that united fiscal conservatives and progressive advocates in questioning the state’s spending decisions.
On Wednesday, leaders of the Tennessee Department of Human Services told lawmakers that the state’s reserve for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, now stands at $305 million with a plan in place to expend the excess funds. 
TANF is a federal block grant program that delivers dollars to each state to provide temporary financial assistance and programs such as job training and child care to families that have fallen on hard times. Tennessee receives $191 million annually. 
Years after public outcry over unspent funds for needy families, Tennessee has $717M stockpile

After years of underspending the funding, Tennessee had accrued the $732 million balance, dwarfing nearly every other state in the nation and prompting lawmakers to enact legislation requiring expenditures of the funding by the end of 2026. The legislature also enacted a law setting a ceiling of $191 million for TANF reserves.
Clarence Carter, who leads the Tennessee Department of Human Services, told lawmakers the state had successfully implemented a plan to spend down the funds after distributing millions to seven community based organizations that implemented pilot projects intended to break generational cycles of poverty. 
The agency now spends all of its annual federal allotment each year, Carter said. Funds not spent directly to aid needy families are now offered as grants to nonprofits. Last year, the agency directed $27 million of its $191 million TANF grant to nonprofits.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/grocery-cart.jpeg,,,2026-01-15 06:57:42.074710

(Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)Helena Moreno enters the New Orleans mayor’s office with a mandate by winning 55% of the vote in the primary and defeating a large slate of candidates without a runoff. Due to her electoral success, there is a great deal of hope that her administration will improve the delivery of city services, fix the streets and other infrastructure, attract new jobs and investment to the city and stop the outmigration of residents. However, the new administration will need to overcome several challenges to achieve these objectives.
The first challenge will be the budget. The original budget submitted to the council at the end of 2025 had an estimated $222 million deficit. Mayor LaToya Cantrell proposed to balance the budget with 30 percent across the board cuts. Moreno and her colleagues on the council instead chose to balance the budget with a series of department mergers, layoffs, furloughs, and strategic service reductions.
The council passed the current $1.6 billion operating budget by overriding a Cantrell veto. While the budget is balanced, the process of surgical cutting necessary to balance it means that the new mayor will have fewer employees and less money to spend. To keep her plan of hiring 100 additional street workers to fill potholes, she will need to shift money from other programs.
In addition to road repairs, the Moreno 100-day plan calls for improving basic city services and infrastructure such as garbage pick-up, streetlights and storm drains. Funding those priorities will require reductions in funding for lower priorities, which will cause some pain for the residents who depend on those lower priority programs. Residents should prepare for some austerity measures for the first year of the administration until the budget stabilizes.

The second challenge will be continuing the public safety improvements the city has achieved during the last three years. The city has seen a reduction in homicides for the last three years and ended 2025 with its lowest number of homicides in 50 years. The NOPD also has recently been released from its nearly 13-year federal consent decree. While the NOPD experienced these successes, it continues to struggle with retaining police officers and currently around 900 officers, far below the department’s official goal of 1,200. As the city moves into Carnival season, followed by festival season, it will need money to make sure residents and tourists are protected.
The third challenge is the upcoming session of the Louisiana State Legislature in March. In addition to regular funding requests the city makes to the state for capital outlay money for infrastructure, and resources for port operations, Moreno will ask for structural changes to the Sewerage & Water Board. She wants to change its technical status from a state-regulated agency to a city agency and remove state authority. Previous bills reforming the structure of the Sewerage & Water Board have not fared well, but this is a new session, and the devil is in the details of the bill.
The fourth challenge will be an attractive economic development plan. The city cannot cut its way out of the budget crisis. It must grow its way out of the budget crisis by increasing revenue. Since the voters are opposed to new sales or property taxes, the only feasible way to increase revenue is to attract new jobs and new residents to the city. Low-hanging fruit in this process would be streamlining the safety and permits office to make it easier for new business to get licensed.
Attracting new business to the city is a multi-year effort and will not happen in the first 100 days. However, the beginning of a new mayor’s term is the period when potential investors will have their eyes on the city. Moreno will need to roll out an attractive comprehensive economic development plan during the first 100 days to immediately catch the attention of anyone thinking about investing in the city. She needs to communicate that the business climate in the city has fundamentally changed for the better.
Moreno has said that she will know she is achieving success when current residents stop leaving the city, and the population grows as new residents move in. Growing the population will take more than the efficient delivery of services. The biggest challenge will be creating a diverse economy with high-paying jobs that make the city a more attractive place to work and live.

Jan. 13, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceAt his speech at the Detroit Economic Club on Tuesday, President Donald Trump announced that he would cut federal funding to any state or city with sanctuary policies.
“Starting February 1, we’re not making any payments to sanctuary cities or states having sanctuary cities, because they do everything possible to protect criminals at the expense of American citizens and it breeds fraud, crime and all of the other problems that come, so we’re not making any payment to anybody that supports sanctuary cities,” Trump said.  
According to the Department of Justice, only one Michigan jurisdiction — the city of East Lansing — is designated as a sanctuary city. However, the Center for Immigration Studies, an anti-immigration think tank lists six Michigan counties — Kalamazoo, Leelanau, Muskegon, Oakland, Washtenaw and Wayne counties —as having some level of sanctuary policies as well.

Trump did not further explain the funding cuts — exactly what money would be cut and how the decision on which jurisdictions would lose funding were not clear in the speech.  
Someone who is familiar with funding threats from Trump is Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, who has filed, or joined in, more than 40 lawsuits suing the federal government in some capacity.
“We’ve filed lawsuits where we can, and predominantly we’ve been successful on that front,” Nessel said following a roundtable in East Lansing on Wednesday. “It’s these broad strokes executive orders that really don’t carry the weight of the law.”
This is not the first attempt by the Trump administration to limit or place stipulations on federal funding — at the end of 2025, his administration announced that states would be required to provide “justification” that federal child care funds they receive are spent on “legitimate” providers in order to get those dollars, as well as limiting access to SNAP funding based on error rates. And Attorney General Dana Nessel has sued the administration over two separate grant stipulations — for Federal Emergency Management Agency and Department of Transportation funding — that would have imposed immigration enforcement requirements on states.

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)An East Baton Rouge Parish judge is expected to rule as soon as this week on whether to dismiss a two-year-old lawsuit against the state of Louisiana over a 2023 law that bans medical professionals from providing transgender health care for minors, following a U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding a similar law in Tennessee.
In January 2024, five Louisiana teenagers and their families sued the state to block Act 466, which had gone into effect after the state legislature voted to override then-Gov. John Bel Edwards’ veto of the legislation. In their initial complaint, they argued that the ban interferes with parents’ ability to make health decisions for their children and unlawfully denies trans kids access to necessary medical care on the basis of their sex, violating the rights of privacy and equal protection under the law that are guaranteed in the Louisiana Constitution.
But that was before the June 2025 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in U.S. v. Skrmetti, which upheld a Tennessee law banning the use of puberty blockers and hormone replacement in treating youth who have gender dysphoria. Transgender youth and adults, their friends and families and a variety of LGBTQIA+ and civil rights groups decried the ruling and many warned that it would result in a worsening in the mental health of trans youths and that it could lead to a nationwide ban on providing treatment to both minors and adults.
“Our plaintiffs, like a lot of people, were profoundly disappointed in the Supreme Court in their decision in Skrmetti,” said Nicholas Hite, a senior attorney at the LGBTQIA+ organization Lambda Legal. Despite the unfavorable ruling in Skrmetti — which addressed questions of federal constitutionality — the plaintiffs, who are listed in the suit under pseudonyms to protect their privacy, have continued their push to have Act 466 ruled unconstitutional as a matter of state law.

The case was originally filed in Orleans Civil District Court, but the state successfully argued in the months after the lawsuit was filed to have it transferred to the 19th Judicial District Court in Baton Rouge, whose jurisdiction includes the state capitol.
The case has been slowly moving through the pretrial process since, held up in part by a back-and-forth over discovery requests to Murrill’s office. When it was moving through the legislature in 2023, attorneys in the office — headed at the time by now-Gov. Jeff Landry — analyzed the bill, vetting it for whether it would pass constitutional muster. Plaintiffs’ attorneys sought to find out about those discussions, which Murrill claimed at first were not subject to disclosure.

Then last August, Murrill’s office filed a motion for dismissal, arguing that the case should be thrown out due to the Supreme Court’s ruling in Skrmetti, arguing that the court ordered lower courts to mind the ruling.
Hite told Verite News that despite the ruling in Skrmetti, the plaintiffs have a case against the state of Louisiana because they are making claims that rights granted to them by the state constitution — not the federal constitution, which is the purview of the U.S. Supreme Court —  are being violated. Ezra Young, a trans rights scholar and lawyer, said that was a smart move by the attorneys for the plaintiffs.
“They have a few state constitutional claims. So that would be wise, because the U.S. Supreme Court has no say on what the constitution of another state means or says. So that hasn’t been foreclosed by Skrmetti,” he said.
Judge Ronald R. Johnson, who is presiding over the case, delayed ruling on the motion so that both sides could finish discovery, but he’ll hear arguments on whether to dismiss the case on Thursday.
‘Unworkable in practice
In late July, after a year of repeated attempts to try to get the AG’s office to comply with their requests for information during the discovery phase of the case, Hite, on behalf of the plaintiffs in the case, asked Johnson to hold Murrill in contempt of court. Hite said at the time that the AG’s office had roughly 170 pages of documents that could be relevant to the case that they did not want to hand over to the plaintiffs.
According to court records, the AG’s office had been claiming for months that they had turned over all relevant records that they could, and that any records they hadn’t turned over were privileged and not subject to disclosure.
The plaintiffs’ legal team, which includes Hite and New Orleans local civil rights attorney William Most, were trying to understand the intent of public officials who were pushing to get the law passed while the bill was moving its way through the legislature.
“There’s not anything in there that I think either of us anticipate to be ultimately determinative in this case,” Hite said. “But they would still be useful so that we can get a full idea of what kinds of conversations were going on inside of our government as they were preparing and passing this legislation.”
The attorney general’s office did not respond to requests for comment for this story.
Although Johnson eventually denied the motion for contempt, he also ordered the AG’s office to release dozens of records over the following months Included in those exhibits are emails between staffers in the AG’s office, peer-reviewed studies on trans health care, and a copy of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s standards of care.
Among the documents was a previously confidential legislative analysis of the youth trans health care ban as it was moving its way through the state legislature. The analysis was completed by Joe Donahue, who was an assistant attorney general during Landry’s term as AG.
Donahue wrote that the bill, which mandates that professional licensing boards revoke the licenses of health care workers who provide trans health care to minors for at least two years, could make state medical licensing boards targets for federal civil rights claims.
“The statutes would also likely be unworkable in practice,” he wrote later, adding that implementation of the law “would create conflicts with existing standards of conduct imposed upon certain professions leaving practitioners with no clear means of compliance and potentially subjecting them to additional liability.”
Sisyphean task
Natalie Rupp, executive director of Trans Income Project, said that before the Skrmetti decision, it was promising to know that there was a legal challenge against Louisiana’s youth trans health care ban.
“It was exciting to have something at our state level that could help define and decide what the rights for trans youth were here,” she said.
But her optimism shifted after the Supreme Court’s ruling, which guaranteed that the legality of trans health care bans would have to be decided on a patchwork, state-by-state basis, similar to what has happened with abortion since the high court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.
“It became very clear that while having a remedy for … this type of case could be helpful, this ‘return to the state’s model,’ the same way they did with abortion, really just disenfranchises anyone who lives in conservative states,” she said.
Still, she said, it’s important to try to stand up to bigotry despite the odds of losing.

“Being in trans politics right now is like being Sisyphus, where we are constantly pushing an uphill battle that we know we’re going to take huge losses on,” she said. “But we also know we’re going to keep pushing the boulder back up the hill every single time, because our lives matter, and it is essential that we keep doing the work.”
Hite took a similar long view of the work needed to try to secure rights not just for transgender youth, but all LGBTQIA+ people. Before joining Lambda Legal, he spent a decade in private practice fighting for the rights of LGBTQIA+ Louisianians.
“My entire legal experience has been devoted and built around the idea that the most marginalized among us deserve robust representation in court. Robust representation in court means that things don’t usually happen quickly. You know, when you’re fighting a whole system, when you’re fighting a whole government. It takes time.”
He said that if the judge rules in favor of the AG’s office on Thursday, the plaintiffs will likely appeal the decision.

(Photo by Leann Ray/West Virginia Watch)A child in West Virginia foster care was injured while living in an Airbnb short-term rental property after the state placed the minor there.
“The child injured in the Airbnb property received appropriate medical care and is doing well, and the situation is being addressed in accordance with state law and child welfare policy,” Angelica Hightower, spokesperson for the state Department of Human Services, confirmed to West Virginia Watch in an email. 
DoHS is using Airbnb short-term rental properties to house foster children because West Virginia doesn’t have enough foster homes or appropriate facilities for kids in the child welfare system. 
There are around 6,000 children in West Virginia foster care.
There are currently 17 foster children living in Airbnb properties and hotels, according to DoHS.
“DoHS occasionally uses Airbnbs, as temporary placements when appropriate,” Hightower said. “These settings can provide a more home-like environment, additional space and access to basic amenities such as kitchens and laundry facilities, which can be especially helpful for youth who need stability and comfort during transitional periods.”
Del. Jonathan Pinson, R-Mason, who has pressed DoHS to end the use of hotels for foster children, said Wednesday he wasn’t aware that the state had been using Airbnb rental properties to house kids. 
“It is important for the Legislature and the executive branch to have a clear picture of children who are being housed in foster placements, children who are being housed in kinship placements, and children who are being housed in any other situation outside of those two traditional family settings,” Pinson said. He and his wife are foster parents who have adopted children through fostering. 
“We, the Legislature and DoHS, want families and children to do better. That’s the goal,” Pinson said. “But until we get to that goal, we have to make sure that we’re being responsive to the obstacles that DoHS is facing, which means we have to have a clear picture.”
Senate Minority Leader Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell, also wasn’t aware that West Virginia foster children were being housed in Airbnbs.










I was not aware of that going on. I am aware that the system has been broken for more than a decade... 


– Sen. Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell


“I was not aware of that going on,” he said. “I am aware that the system has been broken for more than a decade, and so I would expect the agency to treat the situation as is — at a critical stage now where kids certainly can’t be left like this. I expect (DoHS) and the administration to immediately pull the fire alarm and address what we’re seeing here.”
Hightower added that, “DoHS continually reviews safety protocols for all placements and remains focused on the health, well-being and safety of every child in its care.”
DoHS spent part of 2025 under a court monitor to address issues related to foster children temporarily living in hotels and 4-H camps in Kanawha County. Kanawha County Circuit Court Judge Maryclaire Akers ordered the monitor after learning that a foster child involved in a case in her court had attempted suicide in a hotel.
In November, WCHS reported that DoHS had updated its temporary lodging of children policy to require that staff notify the judge and treatment team within 24 hours of any child’s attempted suicide or other medical emergencies resulting in medical attention or call to law enforcement. 
Additionally, DoHS changed its policy to include that all children in lodging have two staff on duty for supervision. 
Pinson said that the use of Airbnbs presents similar concerns as the state’s use of hotels for children.
“All of those same concerns still exist in renting an Airbnb in order to place a foster child, even if it’s just for temporary placement,” he said.
Woelfel called on Gov. Patrick Morrisey and DoHS Secretary Alex Mayer to immediately create a committee to look at “how bad the situation is” in West Virginia’s foster care system.
Lawmakers prioritize foster care reform as system still in crisis
As state lawmakers gaveled in Wednesday for the 60-day legislative session, foster care reform is on the priority lists for Republicans and Democrats.
Pinson will introduce a bill that would require DoHS to create a “central reception center” and emergency resource homes for foster children for up to 72 hours. This would be an option for children only if a home couldn’t be found immediately, and the goal is to end the use of hotel placements.
“We’re going to bring this child here into a home-like environment that’s well staffed and can begin to love on these children and try to help them during this time of crisis to prevent them from having to go to an Airbnb or a hotel,” Pinson explained. He introduced a similar bill last year. 
Morrisey has also made foster care reform a priority of his administration and announced plans to create a $6 million fund to bring hundreds of foster children in out-of-state facilities back to West Virginia. There are 380 kids in out-of-state institutions in states including California, Florida, Texas and Utah, according to DoHS data.
The governor’s plan includes renovating in-state hospitals to house foster children, and Pinson said expanding the in-state options could help reduce the use of hotels and Airbnbs for foster kids. 
Pinson stressed that the answer to the ongoing shortage of foster placements was to recruit  and retain excellent foster families.
“ … So that when children are taken into state custody, we can immediately place them with a foster family, and that child can have continuity of care for the length of time that they’re in state custody, and unfortunately, that has proven to be a long time,” he said.

(Photo by Robin May/The Current)Interim University of Louisiana-Lafayette President Ramesh Kolluru racked up several endorsements at the inaugural meeting of UL’s presidential search committee held Wednesday.
While not “intended” as a forum for advocating for any one candidate — as described by committee chairman Rick Gallot — several speakers used the meeting’s public comment period as a platform to explicitly back Kolluru.
Supporters pointed to his role in building UL’s research division in making the case for his appointment.
“This man turned this university into a Carnegie Research 1 institution,” said E. Gerald “T-Boy” Hebert, a former UL system board member.
Kolluru has made no secret of his ambition to lead UL, and was at one time reported to be in-line to get the job without a search, despite system rules requiring one.
He took over as interim president in November, replacing provost Jaimie Hebert, and announced a reorganization of the university’s administration, eliminating three vice-president positions.
UL is at something of a crossroads, working through a $50 million budget gap and declining full-time enrollment, as the search for a president to guide the university through those challenges gets underway.
Search committee members were named in December. From here, the committee is poised to move quickly with a review of finalists scheduled for Feb. 27.

(Photo: EPA) A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency inspection of the Smitty’s Supply Inc. petroleum packaging plant in Tangipahoa Parish discovered hundreds of other chemical spills and hazards in areas unaffected by the August explosion and fire. 
EPA officials detailed their findings in an inspection report that formed the basis of a consent order that requires the company to address violations inspectors documented during an Oct. 7 visit to the Roseland facility. The agency made the report public Tuesday, stating in a news release that inspectors found an estimated 250 damaged containers, 200 chemical spills and more than 300 containers of unlabeled or unidentified substances.
Clay Garside, a New Orleans environmental law attorney, said the findings depict a “horror show” unlike any he has seen. He is representing the advocacy group Louisiana Environmental Action Network in a lawsuit against Smitty’s Supply to ensure the company fully addresses the impact of the disaster.
“I’ve seen some pretty bad stuff but nothing this egregious,” Garside said.
Smitty’s Supply did not respond to a request for comment. It has filed its own lawsuit against the companies that made and maintained the tanks that exploded. 
The EPA conducted the inspection a month and a half after the Aug. 22 Smitty’s Supply disaster sent millions of gallons of hazardous materials onto neighboring properties and pouring into waterways, including the Tangipahoa River. 
The report includes alleged violations discovered in two undamaged warehouses that are the apparent focus of a related environmental crimes investigation, though the agency has said little about that case. The EPA Criminal Investigative Division, with assistance from the FBI, served a search warrant at the facility Nov. 18 that paused recovery operations near Warehouse 6 and Warehouse 10 for two days, according to information from other EPA records.
Records reveal federal criminal search warrant served at Smitty’s Supply

The October inspection was led by the EPA’s compliance division, which gathers evidence for the agency’s more common civil enforcement proceedings such as the administrative consent order. 
According to its report, EPA inspectors found evidence of active and old chemical spills, many from unlabeled containers that were haphazardly stored. The containers included large 275-gallon totes, 55-gallon drums and 5-gallon buckets. Hundreds were found damaged, corroded, bulging, crushed, leaking, punctured, fallen or at risk of falling from high stacks or shelves. 
Many containers had no labels except for rudimentary hand-written notes with vague warnings such as “Danger,” “Waste,” “Bad,” “Expired,” and in one instance “Do Not Touch must do Labs.” Some labeled with “Corrosive” placards had their tops cut open with oily liquids, trash and debris inside. 
In one area of the facility called the Truck Stop, inspectors found a collection of drums with “Radioactive” placards, with yellow police crime scene tape wrapped around the barrels. 
Oily liquids were found in open drums, buckets and other containers — many without lids or with pieces of cardboard serving as makeshift covers. Some open drums sat outside with unidentified oily liquids, trash and random discarded items inside. Others were in patches of grass with no containment area to prevent spills from escaping.
Many containers had spilled or were actively spilling chemicals at the time of the inspection, the records said. Some unlabeled containers were surrounded by weeds and visibly deteriorating, and others were surrounded by barren patches of soil saturated with an unknown oily material. 
Some totes, which are large, plastic containers with metal support cages, appeared damaged, corroded or bulging with pressure. In one section of pavement used as an outdoor storage area, many unlabeled totes and drums were precariously stacked on top of others without the support of pallets and dangerously leaning over.  Some stacks were leaning, and others had fallen over with puddles of chemicals on the ground nearby. None of the containers were labeled, except for one with the word “Bad” written on it.
In one warehouse, a 55-gallon drum of oil was roped off with red caution tape bearing the word “Danger.” The drum was sitting on a crushed wooden pallet next to sealed pallets of brake fluid.
Also inside of that warehouse was evidence of other spilled chemicals on the floor underneath totes and bulging containers. One  tote contained an industrial form of concentrated hydrogen peroxide, a volatile chemical that can cause skin burns and explode under certain conditions.
Inspectors were unable to fully examine one storage area because its access points were blocked by a grease spill approximately 3 inches thick and spanning about 100 square feet, according to the EPA report. 
In some cases, inspectors said Smitty’s Supply employees made half-hearted attempts to clean spilled chemicals by covering them with cardboard. Other spills were left untouched, forming puddles on the floors of warehouses and on the ground outdoors. 
Animal tracks were found on the floor inside one of the warehouses, indicating wildlife had access to the space. The animal appeared to track an unknown white substance across the floor.
Bottled and packaged chemical products on shelves were leaking and in danger of tipping over. 
Some incompatible products were hazardously stored together in the same area with one pallet of corrosive chemicals placed next to a pallet of flammable chemicals. 
Sealed drums labeled “corrosive” had an unknown liquid leaking onto them, and totes of other corrosive chemicals were actively leaking onto the floor at the time of the inspection with no evidence of cleanup attempts. 
Other findings included:

Concrete containment walls surrounding large permanent tanks had cracks with unknown liquids seeping through, some flowing offsite. There was no evidence of repairs, though someone had painted arrows on one wall to mark a crack.
A tote of sulfonic acid had a leaking spigot dripping its contents onto the floor of the facility’s grease plant. A worker had stuffed a rag in the spigot to try to plug the leak.
Grease tanks had pipes and valves caked with an accumulation of leaking contents.
Containers of open unidentified substances were stored at the top of a staircase.
Old lead-acid vehicle batteries were strewn randomly across the property. In one workshop, a collection of old batteries was leaking next to a pair of unlabeled compressed gas cylinders.  

The report totals 230 pages, most showing photographic evidence of the findings.
Many of the containers looked old and weathered and as if they hadn’t been moved in years, while others looked as if they had been moved more recently possibly as part of the recovery operations following the Aug. 22 disaster, according to the photos in the report. 
Although Smitty’s Supply voluntarily agreed to the EPA’s consent order, the company has neither admitted to or denied the allegations in the inspection report. The order doesn’t prevent the EPA from enforcing other allegations including any criminal allegations that might be under investigation. 
Candy Cardwell, whose home is among those closest to the Smitty’s Supply plant, was packing up her life in Roseland when reached by phone Wednesday. Unable to go outside without becoming physically ill, Cardwell said she is moving to California this week.
“I never thought in a million years something like this would happen,” Cardwell said, adding that she hasn’t been able to sell her house.
The EPA’s inspection findings show a company with little regard for human life, she said.
“The owners have taken every opportunity in front of them and exploited it … to the extent that I question their ethical and moral standards,” Cardwell said. “And I think this has gone on for a long time.
“I think that the company has taken every shortcut, trying to maximize profits and putting their employees at risk and the residents in surrounding areas at risk with no qualms about what they were gonna destroy.”

Rob Brown opened Da Sammich Spot Restaurant and Resource Hub in Orange Mound in March 2025 to be a “cultural hub for regular, everyday people in the community,” he said. The dining room’s walls are covered in wavy patterns of yellow and white. The space is dotted with positive quotes, hand-painted in bright-orange, bold text: “Respect humans. Protect children. Lettuce be friends.”
But on Sunday night, the restaurant became a scene of fear and confusion when dozens of law enforcement and military officers staked out the parking lot, although Da Sammich Spot was closed. The National Guard and several other local, state and federal law enforcement agencies have been patrolling the city since September as part of President Donald Trump’s Memphis Safe Task Force.
Community members said they saw people wearing military uniforms standing in front of several businesses along Park Avenue on Sunday night. “A friend texted me and was like, ‘Hey, I was riding past and saw the National Guard setting up in front of your restaurant.’ So I turned on my camera first and saw them,” Brown told MLK50: Justice Through Journalism.
Brown was at his home, just minutes away from the restaurant. After seeing the live camera footage, he showed up and asked them to move their van. It was blocking the restaurant’s entrance, Brown said. They agreed to move, but soon after, more than 20 law enforcement and military officers filed into the cramped parking lot.

(Scenes from Rob Brown’s Facebook Live on Jan. 4, 2026.)
Almost instinctively, Brown started a livestream on Facebook at 8:22 p.m. on Sunday. A social media video showed that the National Guard was present first. Moments later, federal agents from the FBI, the U.S. Marshal’s Service, and Homeland Security Investigations arrived. Officers from the Memphis Police Department were also on the scene around 9 p.m. Officers were responding to a “disturbance at Park and Semmes,” an MPD spokesperson told MLK50 via text.
“I’m getting more and more scared for my life,” Brown said during the livestream as he pointed out all the weapons task force members were carrying. Brown went into “fight-or-flight” mode as a result of PTSD, he said.
“My adrenaline (was) pumping,” Brown said. “Things will go from zero to 100 in Memphis.”
The sudden police and military presence felt like an affront to the restaurant’s mission as “a safe space for the community,” Brown said. That mission is part of the reason Brown accepted the offer to put a new sign on the front door of his restaurant from a community organizer when the task force began its work in the fall.

(Scenes from Hunter Demster’s Facebook Live on Jan. 4, 2026)
“Come to find out, I’m one of the only businesses in the city that actually put it up,” he said.
Taped to the front door, the sign is a laminated sheet of printer paper. “Stop. No ICE access in this business. Notice to all law enforcement & immigration agents,” it reads. “If you attempt to enter this business without a valid judicial warrant, you will be asked to leave. This policy is in compliance with: U.S. Constitution, 4th Amendment.”
“It’s just crazy that the one space in the whole neighborhood that has this sign up, y’all come park in front of it,” Brown said while livestreaming on social media. “It’s an occupying force right here…This shit don’t make no sense.”
When Brown told guard members that he felt unsafe, one responded: “We’re patrolling this whole area.”
As Brown aired his experience on social media, other community members showed up to support him. Their presence seemed to “de-escalate the situation,” Brown said, and by 9:43 p.m., the parking lot was mostly empty. No arrests were made, nor any citations given.

Tyler Foster, a law student and vice president of the Memphis Interfaith Coalition for Action and Hope, said in an email that community members were threatened with arrest for disorderly conduct as they protested law enforcement’s presence. Foster was one of the people who arrived Sunday night to support Brown.
Jackson Brown, a spokesperson for the National Guard, said the guard was aware of the interaction in front of Da Sammich Spot.
“Our mission is to make Memphis and Memphians safe by providing assistance to local and federal law enforcement agencies in their duties,” he said in a statement. “We are committed to the communities of Memphis and all Memphians.”
The U.S. Marshals Service, which oversees the task force, referred a request for comment to the Memphis police, saying, “Though the task force is indeed multi-agency, the MPD is the agency that works most [with]  the Guard. They would have a better firsthand explanation of the situation.” An MPD spokesperson described the National Guard as “extra eyes and ears in our city.”
Now, Foster and others are calling on MPD to release all body-worn camera footage from the Sunday night scene, and to adopt and publish written policies governing cooperation with the National Guard and federal law enforcement agencies.
 The task force left. The community showed up.

By Tuesday afternoon, Da Sammich Spot had returned to its normal state. Sunshine filled the dining room. The front door stood open, welcoming fresh air from an unusually warm January afternoon. Faint sounds of traffic faded into the background as classic R&B tunes filled the air. Several people were hanging out in the dining room, talking, playing games and sharing meals.
So many customers visited the restaurant on Monday and Tuesday that it sold out of food both afternoons. Like many there, Wayne VanDeveer had visited Da Sammich Spot after he saw the videos from Sunday night’s incident on social media. VanDeveer, a resident of Central Gardens, wore a Smokey the Bear T-shirt. “Only you can prevent fascism,” the T-shirt read.
“(I) had to come support the neighborhood,” VanDeveer said. “Here it is, a property [manager] can’t get people off his property. Normally, you’d call the police, but here’s the police doing the crime.”
Daniel Bader, a lifelong Memphis resident, drove from Midtown during his lunch break on Tuesday to place a to-go order. It was his first time visiting the restaurant to “support local businesses” and to “show love,” he said.
“I don’t mind the National Guard. …They’re following orders, which is not a great thing to do all the time. They don’t want to be here,” Bader said. “We don’t need the Memphis Safe Task Force here.” State and federal agents “want to be here…causing chaos,” he added.
Brown described the police and military’s presence as “just another day in Memphis.” “This ain’t new,” he said. “We’ve been dealing with this way before the task force got here. MPD will pull up the exact same way with those aggressive tactics,” Brown said, referencing the U.S. Department of Justice’s report, which found MPD has a pattern of violating people’s civil rights. The 70-page report was released in December 2024.

Bluu Davis, a friend of Brown’s, also visited the restaurant on Tuesday. She agreed that the “Memphis experience” includes seeing retaliation by police officers, and that Sunday’s interaction could have escalated into something much worse.
“They could’ve gotten into an altercation,” she said. “Rob could’ve been arrested, or guns could’ve been drawn. We’ve seen it happen for something less.”
Despite this, “Da Sammich Spot will continue to be a positive place because the right person is occupying this space,” she said. “The sun came out perfectly after that incident. We’re not going to be scared to go into a space that the task force – that we didn’t ask for – is here trying to intimidate.”
Brown’s focus is back on building “stability for the restaurant,” he said, after months of dealing with poor building conditions and a contentious relationship with his landlord. Since the Sunday-night incident, he’s faced surprise visits from the Shelby County Health Department, which is threatening to shut down the restaurant due to “missing paperwork: a certificate of occupancy,” Brown said.
Brown has also received several supportive phone calls from people in Memphis, Chattanooga, Chicago and other places across the country. “I’m just trying to get back to doing some of the stuff I’ve been doing since I opened the restaurant … community events and inviting people and organizations in,” he said.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/260107_TN_MLK_Da_Sammich_Spot_BV_0022-scaled.jpg-1024x768.webp,,,2026-01-15 06:57:42.074710

(Getty Images)Imagine starting the new year with the promise of at least a $147 million payout from the federal government.
But there are strings attached.
In late December, President Donald Trump’s administration announced how much all 50 states would get under its new Rural Health Transformation Program, assigning them to use the money to fix systemic problems that leave rural Americans without access to good health care. Now, the clock is ticking.
Within eight months, states must submit revised budgets, begin spending, and show the money is going to good use. Federal officials will begin reviewing state progress in late summer and announce 2027 funding levels by the end of October.
The money — divided into unique allocations for each state, ranging from $147 million for New Jersey to $281 million for Texas — represents the first $10 billion installment from the five-year, $50 billion program. Congress created the fund as a last-minute sweetener in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act last summer to offset the outsize fallout anticipated in rural communities from the statute’s nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid spending cuts over the next decade.
Federal officials crafted the fund to give states “space to be creative,” Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said on a call with reporters after announcing the funding Dec. 29. “Some states will fail, and we will learn from that.”
The money was divided according to a complicated formula.
In 2026, each state will receive an equal $100 million share under the law for the first half of the money, plus additional funding from the second half. Oz’s staff steered payouts from the second portion based on each state’s rural score, as well as results from a “technical” scoring system for project proposals.
Within hours of the announcement, academics and researchers began to parse the awards to better understand why some states received more than others, including whether the awards reflected any partisanship or political favoritism.
At first glance, total awards do not appear to favor states governed by either Republicans or Democrats. But one academic data analysis teased out the amount awarded for each state’s technical score, which is the part determined by the discretion of agency officials.
The analysis was performed at the University of North Carolina’s Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, which specializes in rural health. A KFF Health News review of the Sheps Center data found that states with Republican governors tended to receive more money for the parts of their application based on the technical score. Democratic-controlled states crowded the bottom quarter of those technical score awards.
Overall, though, the state awards reveal wild variation in how much money each state will get per rural resident, almost a hundredfold difference between the top and bottom.
In an emailed statement to The Arizona Republic, a spokesperson for Arizona’s Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs accused the administration of shortchanging rural residents in the state, which was awarded $167 million this year from the program.
CMS spokesperson Chris Krepich said in an emailed statement to KFF Health News that “politics played no role in funding decisions.”
On the December call, Oz pushed states to start working on policy actions championed by the administration — such as approving presidential fitness tests and restricting food benefits — that could require legislative approval.
Half of states promised to mandate the presidential fitness test, Oz said. Many states also proposed food waivers under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, which would limit low-nutrition items such as soda. He also said some states promised to teach health care professionals about nutrition. And others confirmed they will repeal certificate-of-need laws, which require companies to prove that new health facilities they want to open are necessary.
Krepich said CMS’ new Office of Rural Health Transformation is hiring program officers to serve as point people for three or four states. Many states are setting up their own offices to oversee the new funding.
Oz highlighted Alabama’s “big maternity initiative with robotics doing ultrasounds” and said states are tackling issues ranging from behavioral health to obesity.
A KFF Health News review of state “project abstracts” and “spotlights” released by CMS shows that many states plan to address the workforce challenges in rural areas. Delaware, for example, plans to use its funding to create the state’s first four-year medical school with a rural primary care track.
A third of states said they want to improve electronic health records, and every state mentioned telehealth.
Many state legislatures must pass laws to distribute the funding to their state offices. Meanwhile, state officials are hiring staff, organizing advisory committees, and preparing to dole out money.
“I’m excited about what’s next,” said Terry Scoggin, former interim chief executive of the Texas Organization of Rural & Community Hospitals, or TORCH. Texas was awarded the biggest allocation. The money will bolster a rural hospital funding bill Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed last year, Scoggin said.
More than two dozen cash-strapped rural hospitals in Texas have closed or been converted to clinics since 2005, a nationwide trend that hit the Lone Star State particularly hard. The state has the largest rural population in the United States. Texas’ allocation amounts to about $66 per rural resident, according to a KFF policy analysis. By contrast, Rhode Island was granted about $6,300 per rural resident.
Scoggin said he has “a ton of concerns” about companies taking the money instead of it helping rural hospitals and residents. “I was blown away about how many for-profit companies reached out.” The companies have also called rural hospitals and asked to work with them to apply for state money, he said.
The awards should be judged on how they benefit rural residents because “the stated goal of the program is to improve rural health,” said Paula Chatterjee, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania who co-authored a Senate Finance Committee memo on the transformation fund.
Researchers at the Sheps Center conducted the analysis to estimate how much money states received from the technical score, which is the portion of funding based on the quality of their proposals and state policy actions that align with “Make America Healthy Again” priorities.
New Mexico won the least amount of technical funding, with less than 10% of its award based on the discretionary metrics. Alaska won the largest technical award, according to the Sheps Center data.
Texas, Nebraska, New Hampshire, and Hawaii rounded out the top five recipients of technical funding. In addition to New Mexico, the other lowest technical awards went to Michigan, New Jersey, Arizona, and California.
Mark Holmes, director of the Sheps Center, declined to comment on whether he saw any political bias in the awards but said the nuance in the final portion of discretionary awards based on technical scores is important because those dollars can be redistributed and potentially clawed back in future years.
“We can be fairly certain that every state will get at least a slightly, if not a vastly, different amount next year based on this re-pooling and reallocation piece,” Holmes said.
States now have a limited time to show they’re using the money effectively to secure future funding.
But they can’t start spending yet. CMS followed standard grant procedures and is requiring each state to submit revised budgets before they can draw down money, Krepich said.
States have until Jan. 30 to resubmit their budgets, and CMS then has 30 days to respond, according to the standard Notice of Award. Under that timing, some states may not have cash in hand until March.
“CMS is working closely with states to complete this process as efficiently as possible,” Krepich said.

(Photo by Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)As Idaho lawmakers convene for the 2026 legislative session, a new statewide poll shows voters are generally optimistic about the state’s direction but want policymakers to focus on transparency, tax relief, and regulatory reform rather than expanding government.
The 2026 Idaho Poll, released on January 12 by the Mountain States Policy Center, surveyed 600 registered Idaho voters and provides a clear snapshot of public priorities heading into the session.
Idahoans are telling lawmakers they like the state’s trajectory, but they want reforms that improve accountability, affordability and opportunity. This poll helps citizens and policymakers prioritize the policies that matter most as the session begins.
Key findings include:

A reform-minded electorate: Nearly half of voters say Idaho is headed in the right direction, but a majority believe reducing regulations and improving the business environment would do more to improve the state than expanding government programs.
Overwhelming support for transparency: Large majorities support measures requiring advance public notice of legislative hearings, clearer disclosure of gas taxes at the pump, and stronger transparency requirements for public school spending.
Strong appetite for tax relief and guardrails: Voters favor automatic income tax reduction triggers when revenues exceed expectations and support requiring a legislative supermajority to raise taxes. Property and income taxes top the list of taxes voters would most like to see reduced.
Education concerns paired with accountability: Most voters rate Idaho public schools as fair or poor and support policies that expand parental options and improve transparency, rather than simply increasing spending.
Housing affordability as a top concern: An overwhelming majority view housing affordability as a serious problem, with broad support for regulatory reforms such as allowing accessory dwelling units and speeding up permitting approvals.
Stable approval of state leaders: Idaho’s governor, legislature, and U.S. senators maintain net-positive approval ratings, signaling an electorate open to constructive policy leadership.

The poll was conducted online by RMG Research from January 2–9, 2026, and has a margin of error of ±3.9 percentage points.
The takeaway is clear. Idahoans want lawmakers to focus on transparency, affordability, and removing barriers that make it harder for families and businesses to succeed.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The ability to acquire cheap, fertile land drove much of American history. Ordinary people — many of them recent immigrants — could obtain land on which to sustain families with very little more than hard work. Land in America is generally owned in “fee simple,” meaning that the owner possesses every aspect of ownership and every possible use. But recent efforts around the country by extractive industries and their legislative allies are threatening this historic type of land ownership. We saw it here in West Virginia during the 2024 legislative session and may see it again in the upcoming session.
Ownership in fee simple enables the landowner to retain the property while conveying pieces of his ownership rights to another, such as by leasing the property or selling the right to develop minerals. An owner can also sell the right not to develop the property through a land protection agreement. In that way he can ensure that the property remains farmland or naturally beautiful land forever. Large timber, coal and gas companies hate this because land protection agreements remove land from the market that could be exploited by them for tremendous profits.
There are two types of land protection agreements, sometimes called “conservation easements.” Both are private contracts made voluntarily by the landowner. One type of agreement is made between the landowner and a government-supported entity, like the Nicholas County Farmland Protection Board. In that type, the landowner keeps the property, but sells the right to use or develop it for non-agricultural purposes. The owner receives income, while the Farmland Protection Board — which buys the development rights — ensures that the land remains farm or agricultural land forever.
A second type of land protection agreement does not involve the government. This type is made between a private landowner and a charitable group like the Land Trust of the Eastern Panhandle to preserve the natural character of valuable scenic or historic land by prohibiting development, including commercial mining and timbering. In this type, the owner donates the development rights and gets a tax deduction for the value of the donation.
Both types of land protection agreements are voluntary choices by the landowner, and both generate income to the landowner while preserving the character of the property for future generations.
But in 2024, an effort was made in the West Virginia Legislature to limit the ability of landowners to protect land and generate income while doing so. The irony of this is palpable. Our Legislature is controlled by Republicans, who purport to be the political party most interested in limiting government intrusion into private affairs.
The vehicle for this effort was Senate Bill 822, which remained alive until the last day of the legislative session when it was removed from the Senate’s calendar. That bill declared it to be state policy to promote land and mineral development and timber harvesting “for the economic benefit of the citizens of the state.” It went on to declare that any land protection agreement interfering with mineral development and timber harvesting would be void if its term exceeded 20 years.
If it had passed, SB 822 would have removed the historic right of landowners to determine how to use their land — or not use it. It would also have eliminated the land protection agreements used as a tool by land trusts to protect land into the future. This is because a federal tax deduction would not be available for the donation of a conservation easement that is not perpetual. And a land protection agreement that becomes void after 20 years would certainly not be perpetual. With no tax deduction, these land protection agreements would simply cease to be attractive to landowners.
The West Virginia effort coincided with the introduction of HR 2773 — the “Landowner Easement Rights Act”–- in the U.S. House of Representatives. That bill would have forbidden the Secretary of the Interior from entering conservation easement agreements with private landowners for longer than 30 years and would have permitted the renegotiation of existing easements with a longer term. That might happen when, for example, an oil company makes a subsequent owner of the protected land an offer he can’t refuse. The feeble justification for HR 2773 offered by its sponsor was concern for future owners who may want to do something else with the land.
I hope the reader will excuse me for not believing that justification. When have large extractive industries been primarily motivated by the land ownership rights of others, particularly those who haven’t even acquired ownership yet? To make sense of this, you have to follow the money. The effort to undermine land protection agreements — and land ownership freedom—- is purely driven by the profit motive of these industries, and they are wrapping that unattractive motivation in the cloak of concern for the future landowner.
The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a right-wing think tank that produces model legislation available for use by state legislators, recently considered model legislation limiting conservation easements to 20 years. The argument made in support was that landowners are somehow defrauded by government, land trusts, and “radical environmentalists” into surrendering their development rights perpetually, thereby binding future generations and freezing the land’s use “according to today’s practices and societal goals.”
To their credit, ALEC recognized a bogus policy idea when they saw it and refused to adopt the model legislation. Reference to it has been completely removed from ALEC’s website.
People often refer to the West Virginia Legislature as a “bad idea machine.” Interfering with a landowner’s property rights and destroying the land protection agreement in the process is a colossal bad idea. Let’s hope that the Legislature resists the temptation to inject government into private land ownership simply to satisfy big industry.

FRANKFORT — During the past two years political committees supporting Republican Attorney General Russell Coleman have quietly raised $1 million, most of it from out of state, including massive contributions from tobacco interests.
One committee is Coleman’s own reelection committee, which formed in 2024 and reported to the Kentucky Registry of Election Finance last week that it has raised $479,379 and currently holds a balance of $350,283.
The other is a super PAC called Safer Kentucky that supported Coleman in 2023 and apparently supports his reelection. Safer Kentucky has raised $517,724 in the past two years and currently holds a balance of $351,086.  
Unlike Coleman’s campaign committee, a super PAC like Safer Kentucky can accept contributions of unlimited amounts in an independent effort to support political candidates. Safer Kentucky reports these big contributions from tobacco interests:

PMI (Philip Morris International) Global Services, of San Rafael, California, gave $50,000 to Safer Kentucky last October. PMI is registered to lobby the Kentucky General Assembly. Super lobbyist Patrick Jennings represents its interests in Frankfort. Jennings is also a donor of $2,200 to Coleman’s reelection campaign.
RAI Services Company (Reynolds American), of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, has given $52,900 to Safer Kentucky and another $2,100 to Coleman’s reelection committee. It also actively lobbies the General Assembly.  
Altria Client Services, of Richmond, Virginia, has given $50,000 to Safer Kentucky and another $2,200 to Coleman’s reelection committee. Altria’s top Frankfort lobbyist is John McCarthy, who gave $2,200 to Coleman’s reelection committee as did his wife Cindy.
Xcaliber International, of Pryor, Oklahoma, which advertises itself as “America’s largest deep-discount tobacco manufacturer’: $30,000 to Safer Kentucky. Two of its executives have each given $2,200 to Coleman’s reelection committee.
Juul Labs Inc., of Washington, D.C., an electronic cigarette maker, gave $15,000 to Safer Kentucky last November.

Other large donors
Tobacco-related companies are not the only large donors to Coleman’s reelection committee and Safer Kentucky:

Churchill Downs gave $29,070 to Safer Kentucky, and Churchill chief executive William Carstanjen gave Coleman’s committee $2,200.
Lawyers with the personal injury law firm Morgan & Morgan, of Orlando,  combined to give $26,200  to Coleman’s reelection committee.
William Austin, chair of Starkey Hearing Technologies, of Brownsville, Texas, gave $15,000 to Safer Kentucky. He and two other top Starkey officials combined to give another $6,500 to Coleman’s committee.
Justin Thompson, owner of the coal company Iron Senergy, of St. Matthews, gave $30,900 to Safer Kentucky. He also gave $2,100 to Coleman’s committee. Another Iron Senergy executive Brian Settles, gave $3,000 to Safer Kentucky and $2,100 to Coleman’s committee.
Galls LLC, the Lexington company that describes itself as the “trusted source for uniforms, tactical gear and essential equipment for America’s public safety professionals,” gave $20,600 to Safer Kentucky. Three of its executives combined to give $4,921 to Coleman’s committee.

Reports filed last week by Coleman’s reelection committee and Safer Kentucky with the Kentucky Registry of Election Finance list scores of other donors giving smaller amounts, many of them lawyers.
 What is unusual is the large  amount raised by the two committees and that so many of the donors are from out of Kentucky. The reports show that people and groups from 37 other states and the District of Columbia donated to one or both of the two committees.
The Office of the Attorney General referred questions about the Coleman fundraising to Coleman’s campaign, but Coleman’s campaign declined to answer questions emailed to it by Kentucky Lantern, including  why tobacco interests donated so much and the relationship between Safer Kentucky and Coleman.
Coleman’s campaign replied with only this statement from Coleman: “It is an honor to serve Kentuckians as Attorney General. Every day our Office is fighting to support law enforcement and make Kentucky a safer place to live, work and raise a family. We are just getting started and will continue putting our all into serving Kentucky!”
The phone number listed in election registry records for Safer Kentucky is also the phone number for C&L Compliance, a Washington-area consultant for Safer Kentucky. Messages left at that number by Kentucky Lantern were not returned.
PMI Global Services, RAI Services Company and Altria Client Services did not respond to phone messages from Kentucky Lantern.
Here’s what Kentucky Lantern found in the reports filed by the two committees.
Coleman’s committee
Coleman is the only candidate for statewide office in 2027 who has raised significant money so far. No one from either political party has registered a campaign committee for the 2027 governor’s race.
Only two other candidates for the 2027 statewide offices — like Coleman, Republican incumbents — have raised any money at all. Agriculture Commissioner Jonathan Shell reports raising $42,800.Auditor Allison Ball reports raising about $5,700.
Stephen Voss, an associate professor of political science at the University of Kentucky, said the $479,379 raised by Coleman’s committee is a huge amount for a candidate in a down-ballot race so early in a campaign. Because Coleman holds the advantages of incumbency plus his years as a U.S. attorney, the added advantage of such a sizable war chest “almost guarantees victory,” Voss said.
Kentucky law firms that have given the most to Coleman committees in the past year include the Paducah-based Bryant Law Center, whose attorneys and their spouses gave $11,000 to Coleman’s reelection committee and $4,000 to Safer Kentucky. Eighteen attorneys at Frost Brown Todd and that firm’s political action committee combined to donate $16,034 to Coleman’s committee. Other Kentucky donors include Nate Morris, the Lexington entrepreneur who is running for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate this year. Morris donated $2,100.
Among the scores of attorneys from across the country who gave is former U.S. Attorney General William Barr, an attorney with Torridon Law Group, in Washington, listed as giving $1,000 last month. Barr served as attorney general during President Donald Trump’s  first administration.  That role made him Coleman’s boss  during part of the time Coleman served as U.S. attorney in the Western District of Kentucky.
Coleman’s committee reported that a major expense so far has been $34,346 to Delullo & Associates for fundraising consulting.
Delullo & Associates is a Republican political consulting firm based in Alexandria, Virginia. Election registry records show the firm has worked in Kentucky for only two committees, Coleman’s attorney general committee and Safer Kentucky.
Safer Kentucky
Safer Kentucky was formed in 2023. Its  registration form posted on the Kentucky Registry of Election website says its purpose is to make independent expenditures that “support candidates that share our ideals and values.”
Records filed with the election finance registry show that its only expenditures to promote a candidate came late in the 2023 campaign — about $70,000 for text messaging and phone calls in support of Coleman’s first run for attorney general.
Since then, its periodic reports show it remains very active raising and spending money. Like Coleman’s reelection committee, a  major expense over the past two years has been payments to Delullo & Associates (totaling $86,424) for fundraising consulting. 
Those records also show that many donors to Safer Kentucky also gave to Coleman’s reelection committee.
Safer Kentucky’s next largest expense over the past two years has been for strategy consulting: about $60,000 paid to SW2 Political, a Washington area consulting firm. The two top officials of SW2 are Scott Will and Seth Wimer, both formerly top officials of the Republican Attorneys General Association. Will and Wimer are each listed as having given $2,200 to Coleman’s reelection committee last month.
Big Tobacco and optics 
As attorney general, Coleman is the Kentucky official most responsible for enforcing the terms of the Master Settlement Agreement,a landmark pact between nearly all states and large tobacco companies in which the companies were released from state lawsuits seeking recovery for costs incurred for treating illnesses caused by smoking. In exchange the participating companies agreed to make annual payments to the states and restrict their marketing of cigarettes.
Perhaps the most contentious tobacco legislation during Coleman’s first two years as attorney general was House Bill 11 in the 2024 session. Backers of the bill said HB 11 would curb underage vaping by limiting vaping products that can be sold in Kentucky to those products authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or that have a “safe-harbor certification”based on their status with the FDA.
But opponents, organized under the name Kentucky Smoke Free Association, said the bill was a move by Big Tobacco to grab market share. That’s because, opponents say, the vaping products of the large tobacco companies already had FDA authorization, while smaller companies were still awaiting authorization.
After the bill was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, Kentucky Smoke Free filed suit to block its enforcement.
Coleman’s office defended the bill in Franklin Circuit Court. After Judge Thomas Wingate dismissed the suit, Coleman praised the ruling. “Our General Assembly is empowered to make laws protecting Kentuckians’ health and charting our course to a bright future,” Coleman said of the court’s action. “This ruling once again underscores that reality.”
Greg Troutman, attorney for Kentucky Smoke Free, said of the Big Tobacco contributions supporting Coleman, “Based upon what I have seen in other states, the legacy tobacco companies are focusing on state attorneys general with direct and PAC contributions to influence policy. State AGs are responsible for ensuring that legacy tobacco companies comply with the 1998 Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. A key element of that Agreement prohibits the legacy tobacco companies from engaging in actions which are likely to lead to increased youth tobacco use. It always creates an optics problem when a regulator accepts campaign contributions from regulated parties.”

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)While more than 400,000 Virginians get their health insurance through the state exchange, over 300,000 utilize special subsidies that expired last year, State Corporation Commission data obtained Wednesday by The Mercury shows. 
The numbers, reflective of June 2025, crystallize how many people are facing the choice between higher premiums this year or forgoing health insurance altogether.
US House backs extension of health insurance subsidies after Dems force vote

Renewing the subsidies has been a paramount debate among federal lawmakers for months, spanning last fall’s government shutdown and persisting into the new year. Last week, when the U.S. House greenlit a measure to extend the credits for three years, U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, was the only GOP member of Virginia’s congressional delegation to join the state’s Democratic representatives in voting to pass it. 
Wittman was one of just 17 Republican congressional representatives nationwide to support the three-year extension effort. The bill still has to pass the Senate and then be signed by President Donald Trump — a vocal critic of the credits. 
 What are ACA tax credits and where are they being used in Virginia?

The subsidies, formally called the Enhanced Premium Tax Credits, help people purchase insurance through the Affordable Care Act. The 16-year-old federal law created government-run marketplaces for people without employer-provided insurance, but who earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid, to be able to buy coverage. The special credits make health care accessible for millions living in lower income brackets around 100 to 400% of the federal poverty level. 
That includes Williamsburg-area resident Natlie Tyer, who said she is able to maintain health insurance thanks to the credits, while she works part time and finishes her master’s degree to become a school counselor. Tyer attends William and Mary in Williamsburg, a historic city in the 1st Congressional District, which Wittman represents. About 30,000 people living there have utilized the subsidies, according to SCC data. 
When asked to explain his vote, Wittman said he was thinking about his constituents when he aligned with his Democratic colleagues to advance the measure to extend the credits.
“This vote was about responsible governance — protecting families from sudden cost increases today while fighting for better, conservative solutions tomorrow,” he said in a statement emailed to The Mercury after declining a phone interview request. 
The Mercury followed up by email asking for more details about health care solutions Wittman would like to seek beyond what he called the “strictly temporary” extension of the subsidies, but did not receive a response by the time of this publication. 
With higher premiums, financially burdened people have been left with the choice to pay more for health care or forgo it and risk being without insurance in case of medical emergencies. 
If the subsidies are not renewed, Tyer has said she may have to go without health insurance coverage in the upcoming year.
“Do I just rely on a strategy of hope until I graduate from grad school, and I get a job in the public school system?” she asked in an interview last summer.
 Analyst: Congressional Republicans’ votes on health care could put them at odds with voters

Before Wittman emerged as the lone congressional Republican in Virginia to side with Democrats on the matter, his colleague in the 2nd District, Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, pressed for one-year and two-year extensions of the subsidies. She voted no on the latest effort to resurrect the credits because the House proposed a three-year extension, she told The Virginian Pilot. 
Political analyst Bob Holsworth said that “Kiggans voted her beliefs, and one can always credit somebody for doing that.” 
“But,” he added, “I think politically this was a damaging vote.”
He noted that Democrats have eyed the districts as potentially flippable, at a time where both affordability issues like health care and a referendum on Trump can motivate people to the polls. 
The Trump-backed reconciliation bill Congress passed last sumer is expected to cause thousands of Virginians and millions nationwide to lose Medicaid health coverage and changes to hospital funding mechanisms could trigger service cuts or closures. Eventually, people with private insurance could see rate raises as hospitals will occasionally negotiate with private insurers to offset costs. 
Both Wittman and Kiggans had been outspoken against previous versions of the bill but ultimately supported it. 
“A lot of people who aren’t affected (by ACA or Medicaid) are still concerned about affordability and the votes of somebody on these high profile issues can kind of leak over into the broader affordability issues as well,” Holsworth said. 
Those reconciliation bill changes, however, won’t fully kick in until after the congressional midterms. 
In the meantime, the ACA subsidy debate is not yet over. While Trump has signaled he would likely veto the matter should it get to his desk, Republican Ohio Senator Bernie Moreno plans to lead the charge to bring the credits back to life on his side of the aisle. 
Moreno has framed supporting the extension as a way to align with Trump’s motto of putting “America first.” To triage immediate financial injury to Americans and Virginians, Wittman described his vote as a short fix for now. 
“Allowing those costs to spike overnight would have punished working families while doing nothing to fix the underlying problems in the system,” he said.

(Photo by VCU Capital News Service)On the first day of the 2026 legislative session, Virginia lawmakers on Wednesday finally adjourned the 2024 Special Session, officially ending a meeting that lasted 612 days.
In the midst of a budget battle after the regular legislative session wrapped, Gov. Glenn Youngkin called lawmakers to Richmond for a special session starting May 13, 2024, to resolve differences between the governor’s and lawmakers’ spending plans. The special session then remained open because the Senate never gaveled out, creating an ongoing opportunity for lawmakers to address the budget — and other matters.
Virginia redraws its congressional districts every 10 years after each census. But last fall, Democratic lawmakers put forward a constitutional amendment to allow the legislature limited power to redraw the state’s congressional districts. It is a strategy to bring Virginia in line with other states that are redrawing voting districts for political leverage. 
President Donald Trump praised states like Texas for their mid-cycle redistricting efforts last summer, in an effort to bolster the GOP majority in Congress ahead of midterm elections. 
House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said the 2024 special session’s achievements included passing a bipartisan budget that prioritized education — including teacher raises and more k-12 public school funding— and other Democratic priorities. 
But sending the redistricting amendment to voters was also a key victory, Scott said.
“I’m proud of the fact that we were able to get the redistricting amendment completed,” Scott said at a Wednesday press conference. “We put it in front of voters, and they knew about it. Now, voters are watching Virginia — not only in the commonwealth, not only in the United States, but all over the world — to see if America has lost its damn mind.”
He added, “I think we have an opportunity now to send a message to the rest of the country that we’re not going to stand by while you rig this election. We will do everything in our power to level the playing field we were talking about.”
Senate Republican Caucus Chairman Mark Obenshain, R-Harrisonburg, said failing to end the session was a move to keep the governor from making his nominations to multiple boards and commissions, and not the “purported purpose” of addressing the budget.
He said one reason Senators were able to reject the 22 appointments to three public university governing boards last year was because the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee was able to meet while the Senate was still in session.
“We’ve been in a special session almost continuously during the course of Governor Youngkin’s term, which is really unprecedented,” Obenshain said. “It was used to keep the governor from making appointments (and) that was largely what it was used for. There was nothing that would have prevented the legislature from being called back, had it been necessary to do so, but we have just entered this hyperpartisan phase in which we’re gonna try and prevent governors from exercising their constitutional prerogatives.” 
House Minority Leader Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, told reporters on Wednesday that he understands the need for a special session on the state budget, but was disappointed that time was spent developing the constitutional amendment to redraw congressional districts right before the gubernatorial election in November.
The results favored Democrats, who will now control the governor’s mansion in addition to the House and Senate.
“Hopefully, we’ll get beyond where we have to be in a special session all the time,” Kilgore said.
Republican Caucus Whip Del. Michael Webert, R-Fauquier, agreed.
“We went into a special session to solve a very specific problem. It was not meant to be used as a tool to continuously identify issues and keep what they’re doing,” Webert said. “We shouldn’t (have been) in two sessions at the same time (and) because of that confusion, I believe … it delegitimizes specific legislative processes.”
But Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, was pleased with the legislative work completed.
“I’m very proud of the progress we were able to make, even with the obstruction of a Republican governor who vetoed a historic number of important bills that Virginians really needed,” Price said.  ”I’m really looking forward to the bills (that) we’ll be able to pass and actually get a signature on this time.”
The proposed constitutional amendment, which will be considered by both chambers, would allow voters to give the legislature the authority to redraw the lines as early as this year. The General Assembly must approve the measure during two consecutive sessions.
Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, added more context about the purpose of Virginia Democrats’ redistricting push.
“I’m glad we were able to be in session to protect American democracy, which is what this redistricting amendment is about. We didn’t want to have to redraw congressional districts, but when a bunch of … Trump Republicans want to figure out a way to keep themselves and Trump in power as long as possible, it became necessary for us to figure out a temporary solution to address that before our bipartisan redistricting commission can act again in 2031.”
The 2024 special session also addressed the reversal of cost-cutting measures to the Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program, which provides tuition-free college for some military families. 
Legislators also wrestled with measures on skill games in the 2024 special session. New bills to create a commission that would oversee skill games and other forms of legal gambling in the state have been introduced in both chambers in this year’s session, which is set to adjourn March 14.

For decades in Virginia, public and private developers who encroach on protected wetlands and streams have been required to offset the impacts by paying to restore similar ecosystems nearby.
The Virginia Department of Transportation, for example, had to buy many credits to compensate for construction to expand the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel.
The process, called mitigation banking, operates as a marketplace where builders and restoration groups trade credits.
But it has become somewhat of a black box, said Jonathan Rak, chief policy advisor for the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality.
“It’s a very inefficient market. It’s not transparent,” he said. “It’s very difficult for the participants to see what’s available, what the price of credits has been. That means that there are some very wild fluctuations from place to place within Virginia and from time to time.”
The state recently launched a website to streamline the market by making this information more accessible. It’s produced in partnership with Water Ledger, a technology company focused on water management.
The Stream, Wetland and Nutrient Credit Exchange, or SWaN, allows anyone to toggle through an interactive map and dashboard to find available credits by watershed and type, such as tidal or non-tidal wetlands.
Market participants can register to use the platform more deeply for trading and research. Eventually, Virginia will charge subscription fees to recoup the cost of launching the website, which was about $500,000, Rak said. The basic website will remain free.
The new platform does not change the way mitigation banks are permitted or operated in Virginia, he said. It’s meant to make it easier for people to move through the process, allowing wetlands to be built more quickly and efficiently.
The wetland credits system is governed by state and federal regulations.
Mitigation banking gained momentum locally in the 1990s. The national practice was formalized in 2008 through joint regulations by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency.
First, developers must prove they can’t avoid ecosystem impacts, Rak said. When they’re deemed necessary, mitigation is required.
Permittees can restore or build new wetlands if they find an appropriate site. Otherwise, they typically pay a nonprofit or private company to create the mitigation bank, or purchase credits available from an existing one.
The credits system is somewhat opaque for members of the public, but it has drawn more attention in recent years from people concerned about development and land conservation.
Residents near Pleasure House Point in Virginia Beach, for example, unsuccessfully fought against the city’s plans to convert a section of maritime forest into wetlands to earn mitigation credits.
City officials said they could not find readily available credits on the open market and needed them quickly to complete flood protection projects elsewhere in the city. Residents conducting research claimed they found other credits that the city could have used instead.
Surry County residents voiced concerns last year about a planned wetlands bank by the nonprofit Nature Conservancy that could drain the beloved Sunken Meadow Pond.
Last summer, environmental groups in Hampton Roads spoke out against an Army Corps decision for a mitigation bank in Prince George County. The groups argued that the project should not be allowed to sell credits in Hampton Roads, because it’s too far from the impacted ecosystem.
The SWaN platform could be used in such situations to provide more transparency for all involved, Rak said.
The credit system could also soon shift because of changes at the federal level.
A 2023 Supreme Court decision, Sackett v. EPA, narrowed the scope of the Clean Water Act, changing the definition of wetlands such that fewer areas will require mitigation. But Virginia’s regulations remain the same.
“There will be an increasing number of permits we expect that will be solely issued by Virginia and will not involve the federal regulations,” Rak said.

(Photo | Isiah Holmes)The Joint Finance Committee unanimously approved the release of $53 million for the University of Wisconsin system to support campuses struggling with declining enrollment. 
The UW system will have $26.5 million in the 2025-26 fiscal year and $26.5 million in the 2026-27 fiscal year that can be used for grants to campuses. The funds were initially set aside for the system in the recent state budget. 
In each year, $15.25 million will be distributed to campuses with declining enrollment over the last two years and $11.25 million will be distributed through a formula dependent on the number of credit hours undergraduates complete.
In 2025, enrollment across the system’s 13 campuses remained stable with about 700 more students enrolled in the fall when compared to 2024. The slight increase represents the third consecutive year of increased enrollment. 
UW President Jay Rothman thanked lawmakers and Evers in a social media post and said the release of the funds “affirms our shared commitment to student success and Wisconsin’s workforce.” 
“Together, we’ll keep more talented graduates in Wisconsin and ensure our universities are delivering the education students deserve and parents expect,” Rothman said.
At the time of the budget process in June, committee co-chair Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) said the funds would “put the thumb on the scale” to help campuses with declining enrollment over the last decade including UW Platteville, which is in his district.
Lawmakers did not debate the release of the funds, though Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto), who voted to release the money, noted that the system has had a growing number of staff members even as enrollment has declined.

Kelly Ayotte speaks with Matt Mayberry, president of the New Hampshire Home Builders Association, as she receives an award from the association praising her signature of 2025 pro-housing bills, Jan. 14, 2026. (Photo by Ethan DeWitt, New Hampshire Bulletin)It has been months since Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed a suite of bills intended to help housing construction, but Matt Mayberry says he’s already seeing results.
Mayberry, the outgoing president of the New Hampshire Home Builders Association, said Wednesday a slight uptick in the number of new listings and homes sold in the past month suggests some of those reforms — like a bill creating a 90-day expedited state permitting process for large developers — are working.
“Housing inventory has gone up in New Hampshire, a little bit, and prices have come down a little,” he said. 
But despite the new laws, many of which prohibit cities and towns from zoning actions that might block new housing, the state’s housing affordability crisis continues. And the debate over how to alleviate it is far from settled. 
In Concord this week, lawmakers in both parties have sparred over weighty, fundamental questions around who should dictate the pace of housing construction and whether limits should exist over local control. On one side are those who say the state stepped too far into an arena that should be the purview of communities. On the other are those who think the state is holding back and should play a bigger role in balancing the housing market.
Sailing through the middle of that divide is Ayotte, who has hailed the top-down deregulatory approach of last year’s anti-zoning bills. With those now law, the state should sit back and watch how the laws that do exist affect the market, Ayotte argued.
“I think it’s very important that we make sure that this legislation that was passed, that we’re following up and seeing how it’s working and making sure it’s working effectively,” Ayotte said in a brief interview Wednesday. “I think it’s good policy.”
She spoke moments after receiving an award from the Home Builders Association celebrating her signature on the 2025 zoning overhaul bills. Among those are a law allowing the construction of detached accessory dwelling units by right; a law allowing developers to build residential housing units in commercial zones, with exceptions; and a law stopping cities and towns from imposing certain parking requirements for new developments. 
Some lawmakers are less willing to hold back. On Monday, Democratic representatives proposed a pair of bills that would seek to tackle housing inequities by taxing second homes. One, proposed by Rep. Jonah Wheeler, of Peterborough, would impose a statewide, 0.75% property tax on homes valued over $500,000 and occupied by their owner less than six months of the year. That tax, which would apply only to the amount of valuation of the house over $500,000, would be kept by the town and could be used to offset local property taxes paid by all residents. 
Another bill, proposed by Rep. Ellen Read of Newmarket, would impose an “unoccupied housing tax” on any property that sits vacant for more than 6 months of the year, which would amount to a doubling of the existing property taxes on the home. 
“We should not be allowing all these empty homes to sit there when we are in the middle of a housing crisis,” Read said. 
Others are seeking to dismantle last year’s law. On Tuesday, Rep. Len Turcotte, a Barrington Republican, led the backlash, speaking in favor of 12 separate bills that would undo pieces of the 2025 zoning overhaul bills and give cities and towns more freedom to set their codes. 
To Turcotte, the new laws have trampled on basic rights.
“If the federal government came and put a federal regulation into place, some kind of a zoning regulation that said … ‘all concrete cement production facilities shall be allowed by right in any zone in the United States,’ we would be up in arms, because that would be the federal government telling us what to do at the state level,” Turcotte said. “The analogy is the same here. … One size fits all mandates are not the way to go.”
At the heart of the policy divide are major unresolved questions. Polling has shown that housing affordability has dominated Granite Staters’ concerns in recent years, and that many support housing construction. An August survey of New Hampshire voters by St. Anselm College found that 62% of respondents wanted more affordable housing built in their neighborhoods, 64% think there should be more state investment in affordable housing, and 68% support allowing owners to convert single-family houses into up to four apartments provided they are connected to water and sewer services. 
But other polling has shown a more mixed picture. A May University of New Hampshire survey found that 40% of respondents opposed requiring cities and towns to adopt zoning codes to increase housing, compared to 38% who supported it, 14% with no opinion, and 9% who didn’t know. That same survey found respondents ranked housing as the “most important problem facing New Hampshire.”
Shortly after that survey, the New Hampshire Municipal Association, which has opposed the zoning overhaul bills, published a newsletter arguing that the survey showed “the claims that there is widespread support to change local zoning is a bit of, pardon the pun, a Potemkin village.”
Recent data suggests the housing market is beginning to cool — or at least is not accelerating so fast. But prices remain staggeringly high and home sales are still far below their levels a decade ago. 
The number of sales in December 2025, traditionally a slow month, increased by 15% over December 2024, according to the latest monthly snapshot from the New Hampshire Association of Realtors. The number of homes for sale rose by 16% over the same time period. The “months supply” of housing — the time it would take to sell all houses on the market if no new ones were added — increased modestly from December 2024 to December 2025, from 1.4 months to 1.5 months. 
The median sales price for a home, however, was $520,000 last month, up 5% from a year before and down only slightly from the 2025 average of $535,000. And last month, the median New Hampshire household income provided just 61% of the recommended income needed to buy a median-priced home, according to the snapshot. 
Amid those persistent cost barriers, Wheeler and Read say their approaches could help provide equity. “We’re looking at a situation where all these homes that are being bought up are being left empty, and that home could be used for somebody who could purchase a $500,000 home and use it as their primary residence,” Wheeler said. 
The proposals to increase property taxes face long odds in the Republican-led Legislature. And they have drawn scorn from owners of short-term rentals and those with second homes, many of whom testified against the bills Monday.
“It’s becoming really impossible to own a second home,” said Chelsi Christensen, a North Hampton resident who owns an Airbnb that she says is “her retirement plan.” “And I don’t feel like that we should be punished for having a second home.”
Christensen said a new tax could threaten her ability to keep the Airbnb. “…Utilities go up, everything goes up. Guest expectations go up. There’s a lot more competition. I can’t raise my rates. So I’m holding on to this property by a thread as it is right now.” She and others argued that short-term rentals provide necessary boosts to the state’s tourism economy, and that imposing higher taxes would price out the ability for individuals to run Airbnbs and advantage corporations. 
Turcotte’s approach against state intervention also faces political difficulty. After hours of testimony, the House Housing Committee voted Tuesday to recommend killing all of Turcotte’s proposed repeal bills. Many of his bills would have reversed legislation that the committee endorsed last year.
Rep. Calvin Beaulier, a Littleton Republican, challenged Turcotte’s assertions that local zoning codes preserve individual property rights more effectively than state zoning mandates. 
“Why is it, in your estimation, OK for a local community to as you frame it, take away someone’s property rights, but somehow at the state level, we’re not supposed to touch it?” he asked. 
For her part, Ayotte says the state has already made meaningful legislative strides. “It was probably the most active legislative session on housing issues, at least in a couple of decades,” she said. And she said the state has already struck an effective balance.
“We’re going to continue to make sure that we respect the local decision-making, but then provide opportunities in areas like conversion of commercial (buildings) to residential (buildings), or ADUs where it makes sense, so that we can expand the housing supply in the state,” she said. 
Mayberry agreed: The state has already passed major legislation, and now the state should let the developers build, he argued. 
”We set the machine in motion,” he said. “Let’s see if it works. Let’s tweak it. Because a good thing with a very responsive Legislature is we can tweak it.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1145537-Ayotte-Mayberry-1-1024x737.jpg,,,2026-01-15 05:56:54.793357

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderI have a recurring nightmare, a nightmare that becomes more realistic with each passing day. It goes like this:
It is November 2026. Here in Georgia and elsewhere, the midterm polls have been looking bad for Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans, but the ballots have finally been cast and are being counted. Tensions are high.
That’s when President Trump sends the National Guard or ICE agents to Fulton County, DeKalb County and other blue-trending areas, claiming massive fraud, seizing voting machines and voiding the election.
If it sounds too crazy to be plausible, I’d like to think so too. 
But let me ask:
Is that scenario more crazy than what happened five years ago, when Trump summoned thousands of supporters to charge the Capitol, also in an effort to overturn an election? Is it more crazy than trying to seize Greenland by force? Is it more crazy than what is happening in Minnesota? Are we moving away from chaos, or hurtling at it?
And it’s clearly on Trump’s mind as well. 
Last month, in a meeting with House Republicans, he expressed disbelief that Democrats might triumph in the midterms, suggesting it’s only because of fraud.
“How do we have to even run against these people?” he said. “I won’t say ‘cancel the election, they should cancel the election,’ because the fake news would say, ‘He wants the elections canceled. He’s a dictator.’ They always call me a dictator.”
And in a recent interview with the New York Times, Trump was reminded that in 2020 he had explored using the National Guard to seize ballot boxes in states where he had alleged fraud. 
“Well, I should have,” Trump said.  
Trump went on to tell the Times that he balked at using the National Guard in 2020 not because he lacked the authority, but because he didn’t think the Guard was “sophisticated enough” to pull it off. He had already tried to pressure the Department of Justice to seize state voting machines, but Attorney General William Barr had refused. Through Rudy Giuliani, Trump then reached out to the Department of Homeland Security to seize machines, but DHS officials also told him that they had no authority to do so.
Somehow, I think Trump’s request would get a very different response this time from the likes of Pete Hegseth, Pam Bondi and Kristi Noem.
Indeed, when asked by Times reporters whether he would consider such a step in 2026, Trump changed the subject.
In those previous requests to seize election equipment, Trump had reportedly focused his attention on a specific but unknown state, a state “that had used machines built by Dominion Voting Systems, where his lawyers believed there had been fraud.”
Georgia uses Dominion voting machines. Dominion was acquired by Missouri-based Liberty Vote in 2025.
In recent social media posts, Trump has continued to rail against voting machines, voting by mail, counting votes beyond midnight of Election Day and the use of QR codes, all of which are standard features of Georgia elections. He has even issued executive orders that claim to abolish such standard features of election operation. In his mind, apparently, that makes it illegal.
According to the Constitution, of course, states are empowered to run their own elections, but the Constitution as it is written on paper is often not the Constitution as recognized by Trump.
“Remember, the States are merely an ‘agent’ for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes,” Trump wrote recently on his social media platform. “They must do what the Federal Government, as represented by the President of the United States, tells them, FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY, to do.”
And what does the president of the United States tell them, “for the good of our country?”
He tells them:
“THE MAIL-IN BALLOT HOAX, USING VOTING MACHINES THAT ARE A COMPLETE AND TOTAL DISASTER, MUST END, NOW!!! REMEMBER, WITHOUT FAIR AND HONEST ELECTIONS, AND STRONG AND POWERFUL BORDERS, YOU DON’T HAVE EVEN A SEMBLANCE OF A COUNTRY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER!!!”
So no, while I do not think it likely, I also do not believe it unthinkable that Trump might claim fraud and dispatch heavily armed, armored, masked federal agents to interrupt vote-counting here in Georgia, and in other swing states as well.

There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.
States are passing laws to prevent artificially intelligent chatbots, such as ChatGPT, from being able to offer mental health advice to young users, following a trend of people harming themselves after seeking therapy from the AI programs.
Chatbots might be able to offer resources, direct users to mental health practitioners or suggest coping strategies. But many mental health experts say that’s a fine line to walk, as vulnerable users in dire situations require care from a professional, someone who must adhere to laws and regulations around their practice.
“I have met some of the families who have really tragically lost their children following interactions that their kids had with chatbots that were designed, in some cases, to be extremely deceptive, if not manipulative, in encouraging kids to end their lives,” said Mitch Prinstein, senior science adviser at the American Psychological Association and an expert on technology and children’s mental health.
“So in such egregious situations, it’s clear that something’s not working right, and we need at least some guardrails to help in situations like that,” he said.
While chatbots have been around for decades, AI technology has become so sophisticated that users may feel like they’re talking to a human. The chatbots don’t have the capacity to offer true empathy or mental health advice like a licensed psychologist would, and they are by design agreeable — a potentially dangerous model for someone with suicidal ideations. Several young people have died by suicide following interactions with chatbots.
States will keep pushing AI laws despite Trump’s efforts to stop them

States have enacted a variety of laws to regulate the types of interactions chatbots can have with users. Illinois and Nevada have completely banned the use of AI for behavioral health. New York and Utah passed laws requiring chatbots to explicitly tell users that they are not human. New York’s law also directs chatbots to detect instances of potential self-harm and refer the user to crisis hotlines and other interventions.
More laws may be coming. California and Pennsylvania are among the states that might consider legislation to regulate AI therapy.
President Donald Trump has criticized state-by-state regulation of AI, saying it stymies innovation. In December, he signed an executive order that aims to support the United States’ “global AI dominance” by overriding state artificial intelligence laws and establishing a national framework.
Still, states are moving ahead. Before Trump’s executive order, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis last month proposed a “Citizen Bill of Rights For Artificial Intelligence” that, among many other things, would prohibit AI from being used for “licensed” therapy or mental health counseling and provide parental controls for minors who may be exposed to it.
“The rise of AI is the most significant economic and cultural shift occurring at the moment; denying the people the ability to channel these technologies in a productive way via self-government constitutes federal government overreach and lets technology companies run wild,” DeSantis wrote on social media platform X in November.
‘A false sense of intimacy’
At a judiciary committee hearing in the U.S. Senate last September, some parents shared their stories about their children’s deaths after ongoing interactions with an artificially intelligent chatbot.
Sewell Setzer III was 14 years old when he died by suicide in 2024 after becoming obsessed with a chatbot.
“Instead of preparing for high school milestones, Sewell spent his last months being manipulated and sexually groomed by chatbots designed by an AI company to seem human, to gain trust, and to keep children like him endlessly engaged by supplanting the actual human relationships in his life,” his mother, Megan Garcia, said during the hearing.
Another parent, Matthew Raine, testified about his son Adam, who died by suicide at age16 after talking for months with ChatGPT, a program owned by the company OpenAI.
“We’re convinced that Adam’s death was avoidable, and because we believe thousands of other teens who are using OpenAI could be in similar danger right now,” Raine said.
AI vs. AI: Patients deploy bots to battle health insurers that deny care

Prinstein, of the American Psychological Association, said that kids are especially vulnerable when it comes to AI chatbots.
“By agreeing with everything that kids say, it develops a false sense of intimacy and trust. That’s really concerning, because kids in particular are developing their brains. That approach is going to be unfairly attractive to kids in a way that may make them unable to use reason, judgment and restraints in the way that adults would likely use when interacting with a chatbot.”
The Federal Trade Commission in September launched an inquiry into seven companies making these AI-powered chatbots, questioning what efforts are in place to protect children.
​​“AI chatbots can effectively mimic human characteristics, emotions, and intentions, and generally are designed to communicate like a friend or confidant, which may prompt some users, especially children and teens, to trust and form relationships with chatbots,” the FTC said in its order.
Companies such as OpenAI have responded by saying that they are working with mental health experts to make their products safer and to limit chances of self-harm among its users.
“Working with mental health experts who have real-world clinical experience, we’ve taught the model to better recognize distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward professional care when appropriate,” the company wrote in a statement last October.
Legislative efforts
With action at the federal level in limbo, efforts to regulate AI chatbots at the state level have had limited success.
Dr. John “Nick” Shumate, a psychiatrist at the Harvard University Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and his colleagues reviewed legislation to regulate mental health-related artificial intelligence systems across all states between January 2022 and May 2025.
The review found 143 bills directly or indirectly related to AI and mental health regulation. As of May 2025, 11 states had enacted 20 laws that researchers found were meaningful, direct and explicit in the ways they attempted to regulate mental health interactions.
They concluded that legislative efforts tended to fall into four different buckets: professional oversight, harm prevention, patient autonomy and data governance.
“You saw safety laws for chatbots and companion AIs, especially around self-harm and suicide response,” Shumate said in an interview.
Medicare’s new AI experiment sparks alarm among doctors, lawmakers

New York enacted one such law last year that requires AI chatbots to remind users every three hours that it is not a human. The law also requires the chatbot to detect the potential of self-harm.
“There’s no denying that in this country, we’re in a mental health crisis,” New York Democratic state Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, the law’s sponsor, said in an interview. “But the solution shouldn’t be to replace human support from licensed professionals with untrained AI chatbots that can leak sensitive information and can lead to broad outcomes.”
In Virginia, Democratic Del. Michelle Maldonado is preparing legislation for this year’s session that would put limits on what chatbots can communicate to users in a therapeutic setting.
“The federal level has been slow to pass things, slow to even create legislative language around things. So we have had no choice but to fill in that gap,” said Maldonado, a former technology lawyer.
She noted that states have passed privacy laws and restrictions on nonconsensual intimate images, licensing requirements and disclosure agreements.
New York Democratic state Sen. Andrew Gounardes, who sponsored a law regulating AI transparency, said he’s seen the growing influence of AI companies at the state level.
And that is concerning to him, he said, as states try to take on AI companies for issues ranging from mental health to misinformation and beyond.
“They are hiring former staffers to become public affairs officers. They are hiring lobbyists who know legislators to kind of get in with them. They’re hosting events, you know, by the Capitol, at political conferences, to try to build goodwill,” Gounardes said.​​
“These are the wealthiest, richest, biggest companies in the world,” he said. “And so we have to really not let up our guard for a moment against that type of concentrated power, money and influence.”

Ohio’s 136th General Assembly has reached its halfway point, as the lawmakers operate on two-year cycles. Bills have until the end of 2026 to pass or else they die. 
The Ohio Senate plans to return at the end of January and the Ohio House is expected to come back in February. 
Charlie Kirk American Heritage Act 
Ohio House Bill 486, also known as the Charlie Kirk American Heritage Act, would allow public schools and public universities to teach the positive impacts of Judeo-Christian religion on American history. 
Republican state Reps. Gary Click and Mike Dovilla introduced the bill, which the Ohio House passed in November.  
The bill outlines several examples that could be taught including the history of the pilgrims, the religious background of signers of the Declaration of Independence, the religious influence on the U.S. Constitution, Benjamin Franklin’s call for prayer at the constitutional convention, the separation of church and state, the role of the Ten Commandments “in shaping American law,” how religious influence shaped the Civil Rights movement, and the impact of evangelist Billy Graham, among others, according to the bill’s language. 
Baby Olivia Act 
Ohio House Bill 485, also known as the “Enact Baby Olivia Act” would require schools to show either the ‘Baby Olivia’ video or a similar video to students every year starting in fifth grade all the way up through twelfth grade beginning with the 2026-27 school year.
Ohio State Rep. Melanie Miller, R–Ashland, introduced the bill, which the Ohio House passed in November. 
The three-minute “Meet Baby Olivia” video was produced by Live Action, which advocates against abortion, and it shows fertilization and fetal growth.
Planned Parenthood calls the “Baby Olivia” video “inaccurate, misleading, and manipulative.” 
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has issues with the bill, saying the video shows gestational age two weeks earlier than starts and shows fetal development as more advanced than it is. 
Ten Commandments in classroom 
Ohio Senate Bill 34 could allow the display of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms. 
Ohio State Sen. Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, introduced the bill which the Ohio Senate passed in November. 
The bill would require public schools to display “historic texts in the classroom.” 
The list includes the Declaration of Independence, U.S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Articles of Confederation, the mottoes of both the U.S. and Ohio, the Magna Carta, the Mayflower Compact, the Northwest Ordinance, and the Ten Commandments.
School districts would have to pick four of the documents. If a document is donated to the schools though, the bill requires it to be displayed.
Success Sequence
Ohio Senate Bill 156 would require schools to teach students to graduate high school, get a job, and get married — in that order — before having a baby. This order of events is known as the success sequence.  
State Sen. Al Cutrona, R-Canfield, introduced the bill, which passed in the Senate in October and has had one hearing so far in the Ohio House Education Committee. 
The bill requires the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce to create a model curriculum for the success sequence for grades 6-12 and this would be a graduation requirement.
Academic interventions 
Ohio Senate Bill 19 would allow a public school student who scored below proficient in a state assessment test in math or English language arts to receive academic intervention services at no cost.
The academic interventions in the bill must be evidence-based and could include high-dosage tutoring at least three days a week, additional instruction time, and an extended school calendar. 
The bill passed unanimously in the Senate in November and the bill now heads to the Ohio House for consideration. Ohio Sen. Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware, introduced the bill.

This story was originally published by Canary Media.
In the far reaches of Appalachian Ohio, DeepRock Disposal Solutions and other companies pump salty, hazardous waste from oil and gas fracking thousands of feet underground at high pressure. Last year, the state gave DeepRock permits to drill two more injection wells for pumping such waste underground. The new wells are slated for rural Washington County, which sits on Ohio’s southeast border.


The state’s approval has drawn fierce opposition from surrounding community members and local governments that fear waste from the wells could escape and pollute their drinking water supply. Leaks have happened before, including from some DeepRock wells. But these opponents haven’t been able to stop the company’s latest drilling plans.


This lack of local authority highlights an unfair discrepancy in Ohio, according to legal experts and clean energy advocates: While state law allows counties, townships, and disgruntled residents’ groups to delay or even doom many solar and wind developments, it blocks almost all local decision-making power over fossil fuel endeavors.


The difference between how Ohio law deals with renewables and petroleum ​“is night and day,” said Heidi Gorovitz Robertson, a professor at Cleveland State University College of Law.


On one hand, state law gives the Ohio Department of Natural Resources ​“sole and exclusive authority” to permit oil and gas activities. ​“So the local governments are cut out entirely,” Robertson explained, noting a 2015 Ohio Supreme Court decision that held that the state’s comprehensive regulation of oil and gas activities preempts even city zoning ordinances that would otherwise restrict that work.


On the other hand, a 2021 law lets counties ban new solar and wind development for most of their territory. Even for ​“grandfathered” projects that are technically exempt from such bans, the Ohio Power Siting Board has used opposition from local governments as grounds for finding such developments were not in the ​“public interest.”


“What you have looks like total inconsistency” when it comes to deciding which energy projects should go where, Robertson said.


That has serious implications for the energy transition: It holds back the projects that would slash planet-warming and health-harming pollution while further entrenching the lead that the oil and gas industry has in Ohio’s electricity sector.


Ohio also treats renewables differently than it does fossil fuel projects when it comes to letting the community participate in permitting decisions. The state lets disgruntled residents intervene as official parties in wind- and solar-permitting cases, which allows those individuals to appeal permit approvals to the Ohio Supreme Court. Yet residents cannot intervene or appeal in cases about where oil and gas activities go.


Advocacy groups such as the Buckeye Environmental Network say this imbalance is making communities like Washington County, where DeepRock plans to inject more fracking waste, less safe.


Fracking — a drilling technique to extract fossil fuels from rocks thousands of feet deep — produces millions of barrels of waste per year. Regular wastewater treatment plants can’t handle those super-salty fluids, which can contain heavy metals, radioactive chemicals, and company ​“trade secret” compounds. That’s why the waste is typically disposed of in deep wells.


Ohio had more than 200 active fracking-waste injection wells as of late 2024, with several already in Washington County.

Marietta, a city of about 13,000 on the Ohio River, abuts Warren Township, where DeepRock will drill the new wells. The city’s leaders worry that the waste could migrate out of the rock layer where it will be stored. A 2019 investigation found that waste had escaped from another injection well in Washington County, although it wasn’t discovered in drinking water at that time.


The Marietta City Council passed a resolution in October that noted problems with waste escaping from other wells, and it urged the state to place a moratorium on disposing of more fracking waste in the area. The city also tried to appeal one of DeepRock’s permits, but the Division of Oil and Gas Resources Management at the Department of Natural Resources responded that its Oil and Gas Commission, which reviews those administrative appeals, lacks jurisdiction for Marietta’s claims.


“People are saying we don’t want these injection wells,” said Roxanne Groff, an advisory board member of the Buckeye Environmental Network. ​“And the main reason is the water.”


Groff’s group is taking another approach to stopping the DeepRock project: It’s suing leaders at the Ohio Department of Natural Resources over the permits issued for the wells. The lawsuit, filed in November, argues the agency illegally relied on outdated regulations that were in effect when DeepRock first filed for its permits but that were replaced in 2022 by stricter rules meant to better protect public safety and health.


“The law is very clear in our view that [the department] should be applying the rules in place at the time of permitting,” said James Yskamp, a senior attorney at the nonprofit Earthjustice, which is representing the Buckeye Environmental Network. When DeepRock applied for its permits in late 2021, the current siting rules were already in draft form, and the public comment period on them had ended. Moreover, the agency didn’t complete technical reviews, provide public notice about the permits, or accept comments on them until last year.


Karina Cheung, a spokesperson for the Department of Natural Resources, said her agency has no comment on pending litigation. But she did note that any permit to operate the wells after they’re drilled will need to comply with current rules in the Ohio Administrative Code. That permit would control how the company pumps waste underground under pressure, but not where that waste goes. And the wells would already have been drilled.


Lawyers for the officials at the Department of Natural Resources and for DeepRock want the case dismissed. The department had no duty to apply the current law, the filings claim. And any harm is speculative, they argue, because it wouldn’t happen until after fracking waste is pumped down.


The Buckeye Environmental Network’s petition before the Franklin County Court of Appeals indicates the two DeepRock wells are approximately 2 miles from protected groundwater resources for people in the city of Marietta and Warren Township. Already-operating wells in the area pump tens of thousands of gallons of fracking waste underground each day. Injecting yet more fluids under high pressure could cause waste to migrate out of deep rock layers and up through rock fissures, abandoned wells, or other conduits, the group alleges.


These concerns are founded on evidence, Groff noted, unlike people’s objections to solar projects, which she said tend to be lacking in factual support or based on false information.


Robertson at Cleveland State has the numbers to back up that claim: She analyzed the grounds for testimony against a utility-scale solar project in a permitting case in 2024. Most objections either had no basis in fact or had already been addressed by permit conditions. The rest were statements of opinion.


To the extent there is any consistency in how Ohio treats different types of energy projects, ​“it’s that the oil and gas industry wins every time,” Robertson said. ​“The oil and gas industry benefits by blocking local voices in oil and gas industry decisions. And the oil and gas industry benefits by having local voices involved in the wind- and solar-energy decision-making.”

(Illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Cellphones have quietly transformed K-12 classrooms into battlegrounds for focus and learning, pulling students’ attention away from their education and toward an endless digital feed. While smartphones have undeniable value outside of school, their presence during the school day has come at a steep cost to learning, mental health and school culture.
As a mom of two teenage daughters, a former school board member and an advocate for children’s well-being, I’m concerned about the effect of cellphones and devices on children’s development. Over the past year, I’ve been researching the effects of consistent cellphone access on children’s development.
What I’ve uncovered should alarm all of us.
We all know the experiences of children today are not the same that you or I experienced growing up. Technology has moved far beyond where most of us probably thought possible even a decade ago. Parents and educators haven’t been able to keep up to ensure we design environments with children’s safety and well-being in mind.
For companies creating these platforms, children’s addiction to them balloons their bottom lines. While these businesses need to change how they target children, we don’t have time to wait for them to change how we integrate technology into kids’ daily lives.
Right now, the Kansas Legislature is considering passing a consistent restriction on use of personal digital devices in K-12 schools. The bipartisan proposal already has support from much of the Senate.
Limiting access to cellphones for students in a school setting isn’t about going backward or trying to artificially resurrect some nostalgic childhood, but it’s about honestly assessing and asking ourselves how kids are doing. In this case, what is nearly constant access to screens, the internet and social media doing to our kids?
States that have implemented similar consistent policies are already seeing results. Conversations in the hallways between classes, improved test scores, more engagement between teachers and students — and I hope, happier kids — tell us this is the right direction for Kansas.
In addition to educational benefits, we expect to see improvement in children’s mental well-being. Adolescence is a precarious and precious time for children to develop and learn more about themselves. Kids who are more often exposed to frequent social media and internet access are vulnerable to more social comparison, self-consciousness, online bullying and chronic anxiety than children in past generations.
We know children are struggling. A decade of data and observations repeatedly show a negative relationship between how much a child is using their digital devices and their happiness, attention, and ability to learn. According to the Kansas Health Institute:

Kansas had the 10th-highest suicide rate in the nation for youths and young adults age 15-24 and the 11th highest for early adolescents age 10-14 in 2016-2020.
From 2016-2020, suicide was the second leading cause of death for Kansas kids and young adults age 10-24.
The Kansas youth suicide rate increased 63.8%, from 13.0 per 100,000 population in 2001-2005, to 21.3 per 100,000 in 2016-2020, which outpaced the 41.1% increase in the United States overall (9.9 to 14.0 per 100,000).

Even without the supporting data, we can sense and see the impact of digital devices on our children. For younger kids, it’s the inability to self-regulate or be in public settings without digital distractions. For teens, it’s often the lack of real-life social connections, poor sleep, the lack of reading real books, and difficulty making eye contact or holding conversations. I dare say that adults are facing these same challenges.
As educators and parents grapple with declining attention spans, rising anxiety, and disrupted classrooms, restricting cell phones in K–12 schools isn’t about taking away access to technology or punishing students — it’s about restoring classrooms as places for curiosity and connection.

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)JD Vance famously admitted he was willing “to create stories” to attract media attention during the 2024 presidential campaign. 
It was his stunning defense of knowingly spreading false, racist rumors of pet-eating Haitian immigrants in his home state of Ohio. 
The lie demonized the large, legally welcomed immigrant population in Springfield to stoke anti-immigrant hostility (against a powerless community) and fuel MAGA zealotry for mass deportations.
Vance’s unconscionable deceit about Springfield Haitians brought terror and bomb threats to the southwestern town but he doubled down on the story he created to win votes and the vice-presidency. 
It was, to say the least, a low point of self-serving shamelessness for the power-drunk Millennial. 
But Vance went lower last week. His take on a Kent State-sized moment that shook the nation to its core was next level Orwellian head games. 
Repulsive hardly describes Vance’s performative spectacle last week justifying the public execution of an American citizen by state militia. 
The horrific killing was all over social media but Vance, to borrow from, Orwell’s 1984 dystopian novel, told us to reject what we saw with our own eyes. 
The vice-president insisted what we saw recorded on multiple cell phone cameras on a street in Minneapolis in broad daylight did not happen as we all saw it happen.
Those cameras caught every angle and the last-words of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in her maroon Honda Pilot before she steered the wheels of her car to leave an intense encounter with masked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. 
“I’m not mad at you,” a smiling Good said to them while resting her arm on the rolled down window of her vehicle. She had just dropped her six-year-old off at school. Her dog was in the back seat. Seconds later she was dead. 
One of the ICE officers, with a pulled-up neck gaiter and cell phone in one hand, whipped out a gun with the other and summarily shot her through the windshield. Then twice more through the driver’s window.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Good’s SUV careened into a parked car. 
Onlookers, including a self-identified physician, who rushed to her aid were waved off by ICE officers. 
It took emergency responders, apparently blocked federal law enforcement vehicles, an estimated 15 minutes to get to the lifeless woman on foot. 
Almost immediately Trump and his minions blamed the victim for being shot in the face. They all but insinuated that she had it coming because she did not obey conflicting ICE commands. 
They wove an official account out of whole cloth without investigation or evidence. 
They exonerated the shooter they decided acted in self-defense. 
They smeared the dead woman as a “domestic terrorist” who “weaponized her vehicle” to kill law enforcement officers. 
They claimed she was part of a left-wing radical network bent on violence with no verification. 
Trump posted that Good “violently, willfully and viciously ran over an ICE officer” who was lucky to be alive and “recovering in the hospital.” It. Never. Happened.
The videos clearly showed a woman in a beanie cap try to drive away from a bad scene. 
In a blink, we see rapid gunfire. Images of a bloody front seat. A glove compartment overflowing with stuffed animals. She had a six-year-old. 
We see the ICE agent lean into the driver’s window to shoot, hear apparent audio of him call Good a profanity and watch him walk to the crash before departing the crime scene altogether. 
Yet Vance, wearing his Trumpy uniform of red tie, white shirt, and blue suit, told us not to believe our lying eyes. 
Good, he declared without equivocation or proof, “was trying to ram this guy with her car and he defended himself.” 
Vance repeated the lie to denigrate the victim who, he was certain, “tried to run someone over” and “incite violence against ICE.” His “torrent of untruths” hit a crescendo. 
“This was an attack on federal law enforcement. This was an attack on law and order. This was an attack on the American people.” Vance framed the fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen by a trigger-happy ICE agent as “a tragedy of her own making.” 
It was “classic terrorism” he said, “what you see is what you get in this case” and I will tell you what you see and believe, he implied.
In Vance’s telling, the ubiquitous videos of a state-sanctioned killing — that crossed the Rubicon — revealed “a woman who aimed her car at a law enforcement officer and pressed on the accelerator,” not an unarmed neighborhood mom who did no such thing. 
The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes.
Vance suggested we owe a “debt of gratitude” to the paramilitary thug who shot Good three times in the head for noncompliance. 
Besides, he stipulated, (on no legal basis) the ICE agent who killed the mother of three is protected with “absolute immunity on the job.” 
He excoriated the media for “prejudging this guy as if he’s a murderer” while prejudging the victim as a “deranged leftist.” 
But as a true Orwellian prototype, Vance must control the narrative — regardless of how twisted or hateful. 
He dehumanized Haitian immigrants in Ohio. 
He disparaged a woman shot dead in Minnesota. 
His knowing lies “justifying the death of Renee Good are a moral stain on the collective witness of our Catholic faith,” wrote the National Catholic Reporter. 
Indeed. But Vance’s calling card is unconscionable.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/Maine Morning Star.)A Maine lawmaker wants to ensure lawfully present immigrants are able to access food assistance after the federal government limited their eligibility to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
The proposal, introduced by independent Rep. Bill Pluecker before the Health and Human Services Committee on Wednesday, would allow lawfully present immigrants who lost access to federal food assistance under HR 1, the Trump administration’s sweeping budget bill, to receive state-funded SNAP benefits. Under the Republican-led bill passed this summer, some immigrants including refugees, domestic violence survivors and human trafficking victims were deemed ineligible for food assistance, despite their legal presence and humanitarian protections. 
In Maine, these groups of legal immigrants have not needed to depend on the state’s SNAP program because they were eligible for its federal counterpart. But with the loss of federal support, Pluecker hopes to clarify that they can instead receive state-funded benefits.
“LD 2051 simply clarifies the definition of non-citizen legally admitted to the United States to ensure that those who should currently receive SNAP benefits in Maine can continue to receive them if they experience a hardship,” said Alex Carter, senior policy advocate at Maine Equal Justice. 
“The intent is not to expand eligibility, but rather to preserve it for as many people as possible under existing law and help make benefit determinations more efficient,” Carter explained.
Maine is one of few states that has a state-funded SNAP program, which, like its federal counterpart, offers food assistance benefits to low-income people. 
While Maine can’t make up for the significant gap left by federal safety net cuts, advocates supported LD 2051, calling it a “targeted, practical step that uses existing infrastructure to prioritize those most impacted,” according to testimony submitted by Ruben Torres of the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition. 
Carter told Maine Morning Star that the bill is an important step to ensuring food security for vulnerable groups, but is an “imperfect solution” because to qualify for Maine’s SNAP program, people have to meet a higher threshold and receive a hardship exception, which means not everyone eligible for federal food assistance would be eligible for state-funded SNAP.
Patterns of food insecurity impact immigrant communities disproportionately in Maine and beyond, and challenges are compounded for immigrant populations of color, according to Sam Zuckerman, policy coordinator of the Permanent Commission on the Status of Racial, Indigenous and Tribal Populations.
Zuckerman cited a 2025 Maine Health report that found 7% of English-speaking patients faced food insecurity, while 20% of non-English speaking patients had. Another study of food insecurity disparities among immigrants found that noncitizens are 1.28 times more likely to face food insecurity than citizens born in the United States. That gap was closed when immigrants had access to SNAP benefits, Zuckerman said, pointing to the need to continue state-funded SNAP for these groups.
Meanwhile, since federal disruptions in SNAP funding late last year, food pantries are continuing to see an unprecedented demand, according to testimony from Preble Street and Good Shepherd Food Bank. Preble Street has had to increase prepared meals from 2,000 to 2,600 a day to meet the need, and now sends out 1,000 food boxes per week, said advocacy director Terence Miller.
There’s also increasing fear of federal immigration enforcement,  according to Miller and Anna Korsen, deputy director of Full Plates Full Potential, who told the committee this has impacted access to food.
“We have been hearing from food pantries who tend to see higher numbers of immigrant families … that there has been a decline in those families because they don’t feel safe to leave their homes,” she told the committee. “And so access to SNAP is even more important for those households.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1125-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-15 04:57:11.778364

DOVER, Del. — The police departments in Dagsboro, Ellendale, and Selbyville have earned state accreditation from the Delaware Police Accreditation Commission, state officials announced.
The accreditation follows a multi-step evaluation process that included on-site inspections, reviews of departmental policies and procedures, and interviews with officers and staff. Assessors confirmed that each department met more than 100 professional standards required by the commission.
“State accreditation requires a commitment to excellence and determination,” said Joshua Bushweller, secretary of the Delaware Department of Safety and Homeland Security and chair of the accreditation commission. “Each agency embraced the challenge and completed the process.”
The Delaware Police Accreditation Commission, established in 2008, sets professional standards for law enforcement agencies across the state. Officials say accreditation is designed to improve officer and public safety, reduce high-risk management issues, strengthen operational efficiency and increase public trust.
Under House Bill 206, all Delaware police agencies are required to obtain accreditation by 2028. State officials said departments are actively working toward compliance through the Police Officer Standards and Training section of the Department of Safety and Homeland Security.
Delaware police agencies range in size from one sworn officer to more than 700. Larger departments often seek national accreditation through the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies, known as CALEA, while smaller departments typically pursue state accreditation due to staffing and funding limitations.
As of this year, 64% of Delaware police agencies are accredited, including 12 with national accreditation and 20 with state accreditation, according to the commission.
The Police Officer Standards and Training Commission, a division of the Department of Safety and Homeland Security, oversees training and certification for police officers statewide and provides guidance to the accreditation commission.
More information is available through the Police Officer Standards and Training Commission.

(Photo by Max Nesterak/MInnesota Reformer)A federal immigration agent shot a man Wednesday evening after a scuffle in north Minneapolis, drawing a crowd of protesters blowing whistles and engaging in minor skirmishes with law enforcement who deployed chemical irritants. 
The shooting comes one week after the killing of Renee Good by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross in south Minneapolis touched off a wave of protests. 
DHS said the man who was shot was pulled over in a “targeted traffic stop” but ran away. When the officer caught up to him, they got into a fight, after which two bystanders also attacked the officer, according to DHS. 
The weapons used on the federal officer: “a shovel or broom stick,” according to DHS.
Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said in a press briefing that he’d heard there was a snow shovel and a broom on the scene. 
“Fearing for his life and safety as he was being ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired a defensive shot to defend his life. The initial subject was hit in the leg,” DHS said. 
Their account couldn’t be confirmed. 
O’Hara said in the briefing Wednesday night that at 6:51 p.m., MPD received 911 calls about the shooting. 
The incident began on I-94, O’Hara said, where federal agents were trying to apprehend a man. The man drove towards a house on the 600 block of 24th Avenue North in north Minneapolis, where he wrecked the car, ran towards a house and got into a struggle with federal agents when a federal agent shot him. 
The man went into the house and refused to come out; eventually, federal agents entered the house. The man was transported to the hospital. His injuries are not life threatening, O’Hara said. 
The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, the state agency that investigates law enforcement shootings, was on the scene along with FBI agents to process evidence.
It’s unclear if state authorities will be allowed to continue investigate the shooting. The U.S. Department of Justice blocked the BCA from participating in the investigation into the fatal shooting of Good, leading local prosecutors to open their own probe. 
Scores of demonstrators showed up to the scene, shouting expletives at federal agents and telling them to get out of Minneapolis. Federal agents deployed tear gas and flash bangs, while some protesters shot fireworks at law enforcement. Two people were detained by federal agents after someone threw fireworks at the agents. At least two vehicles used by federal officers were vandalized.

By 11:30, law-enforcement and demonstrators mostly left the scene, though some remained.
O’Hara said the crowd had crossed the line into an unlawful assembly and State Patrol and Hennepin County sheriff’s deputies responded to requests for help with crowd control. 
Mayor Jacob Frey renewed his call for residents to remain peaceful and not “take the bait.” 
“Go home,” Frey said. “We cannot counter Donald Trump’s chaos with our own brand of chaos.”
Frey also renewed his call for DHS to end its aggressive operation in the city, which the agency calls its largest operation ever. Minnesota along with the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul filed a lawsuit seeking to force DHS to end its operation, calling it a “federal invasion.” 
The roughly 3,000 federal agents in the state far outnumber Minneapolis’ roughly 600 police officers, who are struggling to respond to 911 calls and investigate crimes on top of near round-the-clock confrontations between federal agents and residents. 
“This is not sustainable. This is an impossible situation that our city is presently being put in,” Frey said. 
Shawn Jackson was parked nearby the scene with his kids in the car. A law enforcement agency — unclear which one — set off flash bangs that detonated the airbags in his car. Officers then sprayed tear gas. The Minneapolis Fire Department took the children — including a baby suffering breathing problems, Jackson’s mother said — to the hospital. 
“They out of control,” Jackson said. 
Patricia Abrams was driving past with her sister when they saw the commotion and stopped. 
She told the Reformer that the ICE incursion into Minnesota is illegal and should end.
“The public should know to get these motherf*cking ICE people outta here. They over here illegally trying to lock immigrants up. B*tch, y’all over here illegally — excuse my French — y’all here illegally trying to lock people up.” 
She added: “D’f*ck’s wrong with you?” 
Local and state politicians were also on the scene: Rep. Mohamud Noor, DFL-Minneapolis, and Minneapolis Council Members Jason Chavez, Aisha Chughtai and Jamal Osman. 
The shooting happened just moments before Gov. Tim Walz made a statewide address encouraging Minnesotans to record federal immigration actions, promising that “accountability is coming” for abuses by federal officers.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0465-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-15 00:57:25.575169

(Peña-Melnyk photo by Christine Condon, Ferguson photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Maryland’s presiding officers opened the 2026 General Assembly by reminding their respective chambers that pocketbook issues should be their primary concern as lawmakers try to address rising costs without adding to them with new taxes.
The speeches by new House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) and Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), now in his seventh year leading the chamber, come as the legislature faces an estimated $1.5 billion budget deficit in the fiscal 2027 budget and demands for increased spending on education and health care, among other areas.
They also come at a time when state residents face steadily increasing costs for utilities, health care and housing, issues that must be at the top of lawmakers’ concerns when making decisions, the leaders said.
“The big issues for us to tackle are far from a secret,” Ferguson said during a roughly 10-minute speech after being unanimously reelected to lead the chamber. “Despite the actions we took last year, our state faces another $1.4 billion deficit. We still must invest in kids and health care. We continue to have an energy affordability crisis in Maryland, and Marylanders are getting whiplash from the increasing cost of their utility bills.”
Peña-Melnyk, elected by acclamation to her first term as speaker, said she fears her children will not be able to buy a home, and told the story of the surging utility bills faced by one of her daughters, a medical student in Baltimore.
“She keeps her thermostat at 60 degrees,” Peña-Melnyk said, “because her last utility bill was more than $300.”
89 days to go, but on day one of the legislative session it’s all back slaps and applause lines

The rising cost could mean that the House of Delegates takes a harder tack with utility companies, Peña-Melnyk said in a meeting with reporters after the House session.
“I told my members to be innovative, to be creative, and to leave it all out there, all right? We need to get relief,” she said. “Now, I will work with the companies, and I will sit down … and talk it out and compromise. But the number one issue that I’m concerned [about] are the people of Maryland.”
Peña-Melnyk has already voiced her support for House Bill 1, a measure that would prohibit certain utility companies from using ratepayer funds for employee bonuses.
The solutions to Maryland’s affordability challenges could come from delegates on either side of the aisle, Peña-Melnyk noted, even though Democrats hold a super-majority in both House and Senate.
“See your fingers?” she said, raising her hand into the air during a roughly 30-minute speech. “They’re not the same. Not the same, but you need them all for your hand to function. There is no reason why we can’t do that here.”
She asked all 141 delegates in the chamber to make suggestions, including about how to respond to a series of damaging audits for Moore administration agencies, which have included reports on lapses by the state foster care system and costly leases for state office buildings.
“How can we provide stronger oversight to ensure that agency audits are addressed and the taxpayer funds are wisely protected? Think about that,” Peña-Melnyk told the House.
Despite the need for cuts to close the budget shortfall, Peña-Melnyk said funds in the state’s multibillion-dollar edcucation reform pan, the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, shouldn’t be among the cuts. As a young girl who immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic and did not speak any English, Peña-Melnyk said the education system lifted her up, allowing her to become an attorney, then College Park city council member and, finally, a delegate and speaker of the House.
“The Blueprint is important,” she said. “I know that we have to figure things out, but we will. But can we all agree that education is a change-maker? Can we do that?”
‘Rooted in justice’
Both leaders worried that any gains lawmakers can come up with could be upended by Trump administration cuts to federal programs and federal jobs — Maryland lost 25,000 federal jobs through the first 11 months of 2025, the most of any state in the nation, according to recent state data.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Ferguson said the legislature “must do three things this year.”
“One, we must grow our economy by capitalizing where Maryland can excel in industries like health care, higher education, quantum biomedical research, transportation and logistics and other private sectors that diversify our economy in the future,” he said. “Second, we must make decisions that ask this simple question: Did we enhance affordability for Marylanders, particularly in areas of health care, energy and housing?
“And third and finally, the Senate of Maryland must protect our state’s residents from what has been too often needlessly cruel [federal] government policies that have too often sown distrust,” Ferguson said.
After the Senate adjourned, Ferguson spoke with reporters on several topics, including immigration. He emphasized that Maryland will always protect immigrants, and has already thrown his support behind legislation, which failed last year,  to ban 287(g) agreements, which allow local police to perform certain immigration enforcement roles to support U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
“We are a country built on immigrants,” Ferguson said. “Of course, we should enforce the law, but we don’t need to do it in a way that disrespects humanity. I think that’s what ICE has become, is a paramilitary force that has disrupted and been offensive to humankind, frankly.”
Those thoughts were echoed by Peña-Melnyk, who said immigrants in the U.S. “deserve to live with dignity and respect.”
“How can we as Americans stand by the disrespect, the abuses, people losing their lives, racial profiling, civil rights violation?” she said of recent aggressive ICE tactics. “It doesn’t matter whether you’re a Republican, a Democrat: What’s right is right. What’s wrong is wrong. You don’t treat any human being that way. My God that I believe in loves everyone.”
Both leaders also support legislation to prohibit face coverings for law enforcement officers in the state, including ICE agents. Under both Senate Bill 1 and House Bill 155, face coverings include a ski mask, neck gaiter or tactical mask. The bills wouldn’t apply to an individual “actively engaged in an undercover operation.”
With another budget deficit in Maryland, Republicans see an opportunity

SB1, sponsored by Sen. Malcolm Augustine (D-Prince George’s), has been scheduled for a Jan. 22 hearing before the Judicial Proceedings Committee. No hearing has been set yet in the House Judiciary Committee for HB155, sponsored by Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s).
When asked if it would pass the House, Peña-Melnyk said, “Yes.”
Ferguson brushed off questions about how state laws would apply to federal officers.
“How a law enforcement entity operates in the state of Maryland is subject to Maryland state laws and constitution,” he said. “I know there is contention about this, but that will have to be figured out in the courts.”
This year’s session is the last of the cycle for lawmakers, all of whom are up for reelection this fall — one of the reasons higher taxes were taken off the table early in the discussion on the current $1.5 billion budget shortfall. But the demands of this year make it different than a typical election year, Ferguson said.
“The old adage used to be that the election year sessions are quiet, where the General Assembly tries to punt on the hard topics and avoid rocking the boat too much. That will not be the case for the 2026 legislative session,” Ferguson said. “Circumstances dictate policy, and circumstances our residents are facing require bold and immediate action.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/speaker_president-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-15 04:57:11.778364

You’d see scenes of golden waves of grain and farmers tilling their crops, and you’d hear a woman talking in glowing terms about the world’s largest phosphate miner.
“Our promise is to always take our commitment to the environment seriously,” the ads would say.
Speaking of glowing, one word you never heard in those TV ads was “radioactive.”  
The process of mining phosphate unearths a certain amount of radiation. That’s what led the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to decree that the waste from phosphate mining and processing would have to be stacked up in gigantic mounds, to protect everybody who’s not in the phosphate business.
The land where the mining once occurred tends to remain radioactive, which means builders do their best to avoid building on top of it. Ha ha, just kidding! Builders in Florida have never cared much about what happens to their buyers.
An estimated 50,000 Floridians now live atop what used to be mining pits. Conditions are still the pits.

“The owners think the property is safe, but it’s not — it’s hazardous,” said Glenn Compton of the environmental group ManaSota-88. “It poses a serious health risk for people.”
Now some of those people are suing Mosaic for leaving behind so much poison.
“The ground and soil that support and form the very foundation upon which [the plaintiffs’] homes sit is contaminated with uranium and radium-226 caused by Mosaic’s phosphate mining operations,” one lawsuit says.
Poor, pitiful (but highly profitable) Mosaic is s-s-scared the company is going to lose — so scared, in fact, that the Fortune 500 company has turned to the Legislature for help.
The Florida House is leaping to shield the big polluter from having to pay for what it’s done. It’s on today’s Special Order Calendar in the House floor, meaning the floor debate will begin.
An X-ray a week
If you ever get sick of the flatness of the Florida peninsula, take a drive through the soaring 200-foot gypsum stacks in the region known as “Bone Valley.”
Bone Valley got that name because it’s the location of an ancient fossil bed full of such extinct animals as giant sloths and saber-toothed tigers. Thanks to the pressure of the 20 to 40 feet of earth above them, those prehistoric creatures’ bones have turned into phosphate rock.
Ever since 1899, when ex-Confederate soldier Albertus Vogt discovered the original phosphate deposit while digging a well near Dunnellon, people have been digging the stuff up and converting it into fertilizer. Phosphate mining now extends through 450,000 acres of Central Florida. Most of the mines are owned by Mosaic, based in Tampa.
When the miners are done, the law requires them to undertake what’s known as “reclamation.” In other words, they put back all the soil, sand, and other “overburden” that they excavated. But there are no rules that say to get rid of the radiation, so the radioactive material that they exposed tends to stay at or near the surface.
Erik Crown via IMDB
A filmmaker and cancer survivor named Erik Crown discovered the results when he traveled through Bone Valley with a Geiger counter while shooting a documentary called “Phosfate.”
“We checked the radiation levels in every place we stopped,” Crown told me. In every place they checked — parks, playgrounds, housing developments — the radiation levels were far above what’s considered safe.
The reclaimed areas all looked nice, Crown told me — “as long as you don’t think about the fact that radiation is everywhere.”
In 2017, residents of Lakeland’s Oakbridge and Grasslands communities sued the developer who built their homes on top of old mining sites.
They reached a confidential settlement in 2024, but, in announcing the deal, their law firm pointed out that “testing before development of the subdivisions showed radiation levels 11 to 21 times higher than the acceptable risk limit.”
Yet the company never warned homebuyers of the danger.
In 2020, residents of two more Mulberry communities, Angler’s Green and Paradise Lakes, filed suit against Mosaic, hoping to hold the company liable for any health damage to the homeowners.
“Exposure to levels of radiation similar to those identified in the Angler’s Green and Paradise Lakes communities,” the suit contends, “translates to residents receiving over one chest X-ray per week — with obviously no diagnostic or health purpose whatsoever.”
Piney Point and other disasters
Phosphate mining has had a huge economic impact on Florida. It also has had a disastrous impact on its ecosystems, contrary to what those TV ads claimed.
For instance, in 1997 a dam full of acidic water atop a gypsum stack at a Mulberry Phosphates fertilizer plant broke during heavy rains. It spilled 56 million gallons of acidic wastewater into the Alafia River, killing every living thing in the 42 miles between Mulberry and Tampa Bay. The company declared bankruptcy.
Or look at the horrific Piney Point disaster five years ago, which resulted from state regulators repeatedly bending the rules to accommodate the mining industry.
Mosaic has played a major role in quite a few of these environmental disasters.
In 2004, to pick just one example, Tropical Storm Frances broke the dam atop a gypsum stack at Mosaic’s Riverview plant. Some 65 million gallons of waste flowed into a creek flowing into Tampa Bay, killing fish, mangroves, and seagrass.
The company generates a lot of pollution to dump, so in 2012 it got a state permit to suck 70 million gallons of water out of the aquifer every day. Mosaic uses the water to dilute its waste before spewing it into various waterways. The permit allowed Mosaic to tap more than 250 wells in Hillsborough, Manatee, Polk, Hardee, and DeSoto counties, an area that since 1992 had been under tight water-use restrictions.
In 2015, the company reached a $2 billion settlement with the EPA over its handling of hazardous waste in both Florida and Louisiana. A government spokesman called it “the most significant enforcement action in the mining and mineral processing arena” in the U.S.
Bruce Bodine via Linkedin
I don’t think the penalty made much of a dent in the company’s finances, though. Its CEO, Bruce Bodine, makes $9.9 million every year.
Anyway, our legislators don’t care about all that environmental damage stuff. To them, drinkable, swimmable, fishable water doesn’t mean much. Piney Point and those other disasters did not lead them to impose any new rules or regulations on this dirty industry.
What they do care about is how generous Mosaic has been to their campaign coffers.
Not just an ATM
For this part of the story, I tip my hat to independent journalist Jason Garcia’s “Seeking Rents” Substack.
“Mosaic is one of the largest campaign contributors in Florida politics,” Garcia reported recently. “Records show the company has donated more than $500,000 to state candidates and committees through the first nine months [of 2025] — including more than $100,000 to a fundraising committee led by GOP leaders in the Florida Senate.”
If you do the company a favor, Mosaic shows that it’s not just an ATM.
Rep. Lawrence McClure via Florida House
Three years ago, Dover Rep. Lawrence McClure, a Republican who’s a partner in an environmental consulting firm, successfully pushed through a bill Mosaic wanted. The bill would let the mining giant test its phosphogypsum waste as road-building material instead of continuing to stack it up in giant mounds. After the bill passed, Mosaic paid $100,000 to sponsor a fundraiser for McClure’s political action committee, Conservative Florida.
When the Tampa Bay Times broke the story on this, McClure contended the fundraiser was not a payback for doing Mosaic’s bidding. He insisted it was nothing more than standard practice, which should tell you a lot about how politics works in Florida.
Still, McClure was so grateful to Mosaic that he’s one of two sponsors on this bill to protect the company from being sued. I picture McClure walking the halls in Tallahassee like that kid with the Pepsi can walking around school in “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” except instead of saying “Save Ferris,” he’s urging everyone, “Save Mosaic!”
“Our Legislature shouldn’t be looking out for them,” said Ragan Whitlock of the Center for Biological Diversity. “They should be looking out for Floridians.”
Once upon a time
Here’s what Mosaic needs to be saved from: a very good law called the Water Quality Assurance Act.
“First enacted nearly 40 years ago, the law imposes something known as ‘strict liability’ on companies that release pollution into the ground or water,” Garcia reported.
That means “they can be forced to compensate people impacted by that pollution regardless of whether the release was accidental or the result of corporate carelessness. The idea is to ensure companies handling materials that can sicken or kill people and wildlife have maximum financial incentive to be as careful as possible.”
Rep. Richard Gentry via Florida House
The bill that Mosaic wrote, and that McClure is co-sponsoring with Rep. Richard Gentry, R-Astor, would undercut that standard. Instead, notes Garcia, “it would no longer be enough to just prove that Mosaic is responsible for the elevated radiation levels. A plaintiff would also have to prove that Mosaic was somehow negligent, too. That’s a much higher bar to have to clear in court.”
In order to avoid lawsuits, the bill says, the phosphate company would have to record a legal notice that the land is a former mine. Then it would have to call in the state Department of Health to conduct a radiation survey. You, as a buyer, might not know about either of these.
McClure told WUSF-FM that the existing law is totes unfair to poor widdle Mosaic. He said it’s wrong to hold the company liable for endangering everyone’s health just because “once upon a time, a machine unearthed some rock.”
By passing this bill, he said, “we’re going to have more data as a function of this than we currently do today.”
Whitlock scoffed at that argument for letting Mosaic off the hook.
“This is still very much a handout to the phosphate companies to reduce their liability,” Whitlock told me. “The breadcrumbs they have provided in return change nothing.”
Making mines into subdivisions
Mosaic execs have been trying since at least 2024 to get the Legislature to protect them from these pesky suits. Each time, though, the effort fell short because that’s how dysfunctional our Legislature is these days.
Why have they been so intent on passing this? Because, Garcia wrote of the 2025 effort, “Mosaic framed the legislation as the key to unlocking real-estate development in one of the most rural parts of Florida.”
Phosphate is a finite resource. Mines don’t last forever. The company is looking ahead to its future.
It learned the lesson of the St. Joe Co., a Panhandle pulp and paper giant that eventually realized it needed a new product. St. Joe closed its paper mill and switched to developing and selling its extensive real estate holdings (with help from the taxpayers).
Mosaic itself, in a handout to legislators last year, told them that “many lands that once supported phosphate mining have untapped potential due to legal uncertainty that limits reuse. By providing liability protections for the sale of previously mined phosphate lands, this legislation removes barriers to repurposing them for new opportunities.”
Now they’re back to try it one more time. The Florida House is so eager to please this major campaign contributor that it’s already held two committee meetings on HB 167. Both of the hearings occurred last year, before the session began this week.
I watched a video of the Judiciary Committee meeting from last November. This bill was the only item on the agenda. The discussion took less than 10 minutes, and then every member of the committee voted yes.
Holding the two committee votes before the start of session means the bill is teed up for fast passage this week. Then it will head to the Senate, where Senate President Ben Albritton is already on board.
Since the skids are so obviously greased for this bill, I say everyone should jump on board – but only if Mosaic agrees to one teeny amendment.
I think the only way the company should avoid being socked with a major monetary penalty is if it agrees to give every person who buys some of its reclaimed land a full hazmat suit to wear while occupying the property.

What began in late December 2025 as nationwide protests driven by economic collapse has become a deep political revolt. Across cities large and small, ordinary Iranians are calling for fundamental change. The regime has responded with escalating brutality. This response shows its fear and weakness.
Information from inside Iran suggests the death toll is staggering. More than 12,000 protesters have reportedly been killed by security forces since the uprising began. These figures come from human rights groups and on-the-ground sources reporting under blackout conditions. Many more have been arrested, disappeared, or injured amid heavy use of force.
Security forces including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Basij militia have fired live ammunition into largely unarmed crowds. Hospitals across the country report hundreds with serious gunshot wounds. The regime has imposed near-total internet shutdowns to hide the violence from the outside world and isolate protesters within Iran.
The sheer scale of the crackdown has alarmed international human rights bodies. United Nations officials have expressed grave concern over mass detentions, threats of execution, and the escalating use of lethal force against civilians.
This uprising goes beyond economic grievances. Protesters are rejecting all forms of dictatorship. They want an end to theocratic rule and reject monarchy as well. Demonstrations have featured chants rejecting both clerical rule and any return to monarchy. Iranians are calling for a secular democratic republic governed by the people, not by clerics or kings.
At the core of these protests is a clear demand. The Iranian people insist on their right to freely choose their future government. They reject any system imposed by force, ideology, or heredity. Their struggle is not for reform within dictatorship, but for a representative government rooted in popular sovereignty and the rule of law.
Reports from opposition networks show that protests have spread to hundreds of cities and towns. The movement reflects a unified demand for systemic change and an end to authoritarian rule.
The regime’s response reveals both terror tactics and deep insecurity. It has relied on mass arrests, lethal force, internet control, and threats of execution against those who dare to stand up. State media attempts to portray the unrest as chaos or foreign-inspired. Yet protesters continue to mobilize despite extreme risk, driven by a determination to reclaim their future.
Despite the danger, the spirit of resistance continues. Iranians inside the country and in the diaspora are calling for a unified push toward a democratic and secular future. Their actions reflect a widely recognized principle: people living under tyranny have the right to resist oppression.
The international community must do more than issue statements of concern. It must recognize the Iranian people’s legitimate right to resist a brutal and unaccountable regime and to determine their own political destiny without interference or imposed alternatives.
The world cannot afford to ignore these demands. With thousands of lives lost, the Islamic Republic’s systematic violence against its own people requires a firm and principled international response. Respect for human rights, self-determination, and justice must be central to any engagement with Iran.

D’Amico,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/15/lets-stop-ignoring-whats-happening-in-americas-nursing-homes/,"Elder abuse and neglect in nursing homes is not a mystery, not a surprise, and not an accident. It is the predictable, inevitable outcome of our system.","Let’s tell the truth. Elder abuse and neglect in nursing homes is not a mystery, not a surprise, and not an accident.
It is the predictable, inevitable outcome of a system that allows the squeezing of profit from the bodies of the elderly while far too often delivering poor care in return. And just when the crisis reached a breaking point, our federal government made it worse.
As reported by MedPage Today (“HHS Officially Rescinds Nursing Home Minimum Staffing Rule,” Joyce Frieden), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services officially rescinded the national minimum-staffing rule enacted in May 2024 that required nursing homes to provide at least 3.48 hours of care per resident per day and to have a Registered Nurse onsite 24/7.
Those protections were not luxuries. They were the minimum needed to keep residents safe and alive.
Patient-advocacy organizations called the decision “very disappointing,” warning that this repeal returns us to a status quo where residents will continue “suffering and dying because nursing homes are not staffed adequately.” They are right.
We know ;exactly what understaffing does, because we have been fighting this system for more than 35 years.
We have represented countless families whose loved ones were injured, abandoned, or betrayed by facilities that promised safety and delivered suffering. We have spent decades hearing the same lines — “falls just happen,” “bedsores are unavoidable,” “we did the best we could.”
But let’s be clear about something critically important: frontline staff are not the enemy. Many aides, nurses, and caregivers desperately want to provide good care. Some cry on their way home, knowing they couldn’t reach all of their residents. They are victims too — trapped in a system where too often administrators, management companies, and private-equity bosses understaff facilities to maximize profit.
These workers are not the cause of the crisis. They are casualties of it. The abuse is not hidden. It has just been ignored for far too long.
Here’s what “cost-cutting” looks like behind closed doors:

A man on a restricted-diet chokes to death because her aide was untrained or never given the essential instructions for her care.
A woman with dementia falls again and again because no one answers call lights for an hour—or longer.
A resident who cannot walk or speak appears with fractures, bruises, and internal injuries… and the facility shrugs.
Bed sores rot into bone because staffing is so low that no one has time to turn a patient.

These are not rare tragedies. They happen too frequently in facilities that know they are understaffed, undertrained, and unsafe — and simply do not care enough to fix it.
And now, thanks to the HHS decision, they no longer will have to meet a national basic safety floor.
We have allowed a system that treats human beings as disposable.
For decades, the elderly have been treated as if they are somehow “worth less” because they are frail or nearing the end of life. Insurance companies argued it openly, while many injury lawyers told families that their loved one’s suffering “didn’t have much value,” and that bringing a lawsuit was not practical.
This is morally wrong and frankly not what we all know to be true.
An elderly person’s life does not shrink in value when their body weakens. Their dignity does not evaporate when they lose the ability to speak, hear, or feed themselves. Their humanity does not vanish when they enter a nursing home.
If anything, the opposite is true: the more vulnerable someone is, the fiercer our obligation to protect them.
Where are our lawmakers? Where is the outrage?
The truth is already in plain sight:

Staffing ratios are dangerously low.
Training requirements need strengthening.
Regulators are understaffed.
Penalties are weak and delayed.
Corporate owners are not held accountable in a meaningful way. 
And now, federal minimum-staffing protections have been gutted.

 And people are dying because of it.
Accountability must finally mean something. We need to stop pretending civil fines and sternly worded letters will fix this. They won’t.
What will?

Mandatory staffing ratios tied to resident acuity
Criminal charges — not just civil penalties — when neglect leads to serious injury or death
Transparency in ownership, finances, and staffing
Real whistleblower protections and encouragement for staff who report abuse
Automatic suspension of licenses for falsified records
Public reporting of all injuries, not just the ones facilities choose to disclose — with significant penalties for failure to report

If a trucking company can face criminal charges when negligence kills someone, why can’t a nursing home?
If an airline can be grounded for safety violations, why can’t a facility that leaves residents to fall, fracture, choke, and die?
Lawsuits alone are not enough — but they matter. For 35 years, we have advocated for the elderly and lawsuits do matter when verdicts finally make neglect more expensive than prevention.
That is why nursing homes work so hard to keep these cases out of court. That is why they hide records, falsify charts, and pressure staff into silence. That is why they push families into arbitration agreements.
They fear the truth. And they should.
This is not just about the elderly. It is about us.  We are all headed in the same direction. If we allow this broken, cruel system to continue, we are condemning not only today’s residents — but our future selves.
This is not merely a fight for the elderly. It is a fight for what kind of society we choose to be.
Enough excuses. Enough silence. Enough injury and death.
We must demand bold reforms. We must insist on real oversight. We must hold corporations personally, financially, and criminally accountable. And we must reject the poisonous idea that an aging life is worth less than any other.
The elderly are not invisible. They are not disposable. They are ours. And it is long past time we acted like it.

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — A youth sports facility has come up as another potential use as part of a North Omaha business park site to be developed with help from a $90 million state grant.
Described as an indoor-outdoor multipurpose complex for “soft turf” sports — such as football, soccer, softball and baseball — the possible project would rise at the Enterprise Park near 16th and Locust Streets, a tract that had previously been downplayed because of environmental cleanup costs.

That area is one of three sites that a development team working with the Omaha Inland Port Authority is seeking to acquire for use as business parks. A community meeting was held Wednesday night to discuss the locations and to get input on what uses the community prefers at each.
Purchases by mid-February
Michael Maroney of the Omaha Economic Development Corp., which leads the private development team working with the port authority, said his team is moving to acquire all three sites. But nothing is final. He said purchases should be made by mid-February.
Maroney was pleased by the turnout of about 75 people and believes the community is getting excited for what is to come.

“We got good feedback,” he said. “We wanted to keep an open mind.”
For those attending the meeting at the Highlander Accelerator campus in North Omaha, the development team laid out possible uses at the three sites. 
The other two tracts and possible uses:

 A 13-acre site centered by a new 150,000-square-foot warehouse and 148-stall surface parking area at 5906 Abbott Drive likely would be leased to commercial tenants. Possible operations include a food hall, offices and event center. The development team compared its possible use to the multi-tenant Ashton Building in the Millwork Commons district in north downtown.
A roughly eight-acre site west of North 16th Street and north of John J Pershing Drive could be used for housing manufacturing, trucking and warehousing or other light industrial uses, said Garry Clark, executive director of the port authority.

Neighboring  sports complexes
The site envisioned as space for the sports complex also would contain an area for commercial businesses to settle, said George Achola, another representative of the private development team.
 

Community favorites
An electronic survey at Wednesday’s meeting asked which potential business park site was most exciting. The community picks, in order: 16th and Locust Streets tract; site near 16th and John J Pershing, 5906 Abbott St. property.
Also asked, What does success look like in the project? Top responses were job creation and community growth.



He said the location seems ideal for a youth sports facility that would complement another rising nearby, the $45 million Levi Carter Park Activity and Sports Complex along the north shore of Carter Lake in Levi Carter Park.
Achola said that nearby facility, to be owned and maintained by the City of Omaha, is to focus on a different set of sports — volleyball and basketball games played on hard courts. He said the two would mesh nicely.
It is likely, Achola said, that his development team would prepare a shovel ready site and an investor would build and operate the sports facility, but all options would be considered.
Achola believes an athletic facility aligns with the objective of the $90 million in state funding: to generate jobs and income for the North Omaha area.
“What North Omaha needs is an economic driver — something that allows people to spend money within the community. That will create jobs,” he said. 
Achola pointed to new youth sports facilities in places like Kearney. “A whole economic system grew up around that and those are jobs,” he said. 
‘Valuable piece of dirt’
Omaha port authority makes key hires, moves toward $90M state-funded business park project

The Nebraska Legislature directed $90 million from pandemic recovery funding to create a shovel-ready industrial business park. The Department of Economic Development and Gov. Jim Pillen in early 2024 awarded the grant funds to the development team led by Maroney’s Omaha Economic Development Corp., Burlington Capital and Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce. State law later was changed to require oversight of the project by the Omaha Inland Port Authority board. And the port authority board earlier this month released necessary funding to purchase the sites.
Asked about cleanup costs at the 16th and Locust Streets site, which was previously used as a dumping area, Achola said that has been a concern. But he said the value of the area is undeniable, as it is close to the airport, a lake, downtown Omaha and perhaps a professional soccer stadium.
“This is going to be one of the few opportunities you have to clean something up and make it an economic driver,” he said. “We’re going to reap the long-term economic benefits of bringing to life a valuable piece of dirt.”

Brown/Maryland Matters)The first day of the General Assembly is traditionally a time for more back slaps than broadsides, more applause lines than arguments, and opening day 2026 was no exception.
The actual business of the day took about an hour in the Senate, about and hour and a half in the House, as each chamber elected its leaders for the session, approved rules and read the first batch of bills across the desk — 231 in the Senate and 301 in the House.
Each chamber was packed with family members, former member and visiting state and local officials — and an international visitor in the House, where the ambassador of the Dominican Republic was on hand to witness the swearing-in of new Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel), a native of the island and the first Afro-Latina leader of the chamber.
Peña-Melnyk spent a chunk of her nearly 30-minute speech heaping praise on former Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County), who was the first woman and first Black lawmaker to lead either chamber of the Maryland General Assembly when she was sworn in in 2019. She announced in early December that she was stepping down as speaker, but would retain her seat as a delegate.
“You have made it possible for someone like me, this little island girl inside, to come here and dream of this possibility,” Peña-Melnyk said to Jones, who was seated front-row center in the House.
“Onc day as we look at all these men in the chamber in these pictures, your picture, your portrait is going to be here,” Peña-Melnyk said, pointing toward the paintings of former House speakers, all men, that ring the chamber. “When little girls come into this chamber, Madam Speaker, your picture will be here and they can dream and they can see it’s possible. You did that.”
Ferguson, who enters his seventh session as leader of the 47-member Senate, spent 3-4 minutes of his roughly 10-minute speech delivering a short history lesson on America and the importance of state governments, as the country celebrates 250 years.
“This is the first time in humankind that this many people in a single country have operated under the same system of representative democratic government for this length of time. The American experiment has not been without significant challenges and extremely painful flaws,” Ferguson said. “That said, the fundamental promise, though, is of a better society over time that is rooted in justice, equality and opportunity has propelled our nation ever forward.”
Ferguson also highlighted lessons he learned from a legislative conference he attended last month in Ohio. Because of what’s going on in the federal government, he said action at the state level “is the only way … to restore people’s trust in government. States truly are the laboratories of democracy. It has been that way for 250 years.”
Most of the day’s speeches were not so weighty, however. Much of the floor time was taken up by lawmakers lauding the nominees, interrupted often by standing ovations. Leaders thanked their families, their constituents, their staff and others.
They often joked with members of their chambers or visitors. After Sen. Malcolm Augustine (D-Prince George’s) was unanimously chosen to remain as president pro tem of the Senate, he thanked Ferguson “for his confidence and partnership and his haircut. It’s very fresh. I didn’t notice that earlier. It is quite fresh.”

Ferguson returned the compliment when he was unanimously reelected as president of the 47-member chamber, telling Augustine, “I don’t know if my haircut is as good as yours.”
In the House, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott was tagged twice, by Peña-Melnyk and by the new speaker pro tem, Del. Luke Clippinger  (D-Baltimore City).
Peña-Melnyk, to illustrate the problem of high utility bills, told the story of how her daughter keeps the thermostat in her Baltimore home “at 60 degrees, because her last utility bill was more than $300, Mr. Mayor,” as she turned to Scott. When that drew laughter from the chamber, she quickly added, “It’s not his fault.”
Clippinger, whose job it was to introduce all the guests, prefaced his introduction of Scott with, “Is this a good time to talk about the potholes on…” before introducing “the mayor of the great city of Baltimore, Brandon Scott,” to laughs.
“We’ll talk later,” he added as an aside.
After that it was time for photos and handshakes with the local and federal officials who packed each chamber,  and then on to the half-dozen receptions being held around the State House by lobbyists and interest groups.

 No cred in State House credentials
But getting to the day’s events in the first place proved a challenge for reporters, lobbyists and some staff, who learned for the first time Wednesday morning that the police-issued credentials that normally let them bypass the weapon detection systems at the State House and legislative office buildings were useless.
As the state works out the kinks in a new AI detection system, badge holders — who are subject to background check by Maryland Capitol Police before a credential is issued — were told they had to wait in line to pass through security, credential or no.


The Maryland-Delaware-District of Columbia Press Association, after getting an inquiry about the issue from Maryland Matters, sent a letter to state officials expressing “deep concern” about the unannounced changes.


“Historically, credentialed members of the press who have completed criminal background checks and obtained official press badges have been permitted to enter these buildings without passing through metal detectors,” MDDC Executive Director Rebecca Snyder wrote.

	“This policy has long recognized the realities of newsgathering: reporters are often entering and exiting buildings multiple times a day to cover matters of public importance, and their work is frequently time-sensitive,” she wrote. “These journalists are clearly identified, vetted, and credentialed by the state.”


The change in policy was not previously announced to the State House press corps, the press association, lobbyists or others with credentials who were affected. Snyder called the opening day roll out “an unpleasant and concerning surprise to learn this morning that members of the press are now required to wait in general security lines—sometimes dozens of people long—to enter public buildings.”


“In recent weeks, Maryland Capitol Police have been seen in the State House engaging in SWAT training and the new system was installed,” Snyder wrote. “While framed as a safety measure, this policy change raises serious concerns about freedom of the press…. The new requirements instead create unnecessary barriers to timely newsgathering, delaying access to public proceedings and information that the public has a right to receive. Over time, such barriers risk chilling coverage of government activity and undermining transparency.”
A spokesperson for the governor said they were working on fixing the problem and that, for the time being, reporters and others with credentials could jump to the front of any line when they needed to get into one of the buildings.

Let the rallies begin
Before the floor sessions began, another part of Annapolis legislative life was already sliding into gear, with a rally on Lawyer’s Mall.
On Wednesday, it was the Chesapeake Climate Action Network that handed out dozens of posters made to look like solar panels, as speakers touted the Affordable Solar Act, which would direct funds already being collected from utility companies toward new solar energy projects.
Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D- Montgomery), the bill’s sponsor, said the bill is partially a response to policy changes from President Donald Trump’s (D) administration. This July, a key federal tax credit for solar projects will disappear, as a result of the “Big, Beautiful Bill.”

“This year, the new threat is Trump and the MAGA regime that is hell-bent on lining the pockets of their fossil fuel buddies, and creating a petrol state in the United States of America — and we will not stand by while that happens,” Charkoudian told the rally.
As she spoke, rally-goers, including dozens of seniors representing Third Act Maryland, held signs with messages like “The Future Runs on the Sun.”
Robin K. Dutta, executive director of the Chesapeake Solar and Storage Association, a trade group for solar developers, said that his group — and the industry — weathered the storm the last time that Congress cut solar tax credits, in 1986.
“We survived the first one. We’re going to survive the second one,” Dutta said. “But here’s how we thrive: We thrive because of the tireless work in state capitals like Annapolis.”
This year might provide a unique opportunity for climate advocates hoping to make their case. With high utility bills at the center of debate, climate groups are arguing that solar and battery storage are the cheapest and quickest ways to add energy to the grid — as opposed to new fossil fuel or nuclear facilities.
“I have a good feeling for the 2026 legislative session,” Charkoudian said.

Candelora, R-North Branford, sat side by side Wednesday night, amiably talking before a live audience about a working relationship that survives partisan differences. In some capitals, that alone would make news.
Had the event occurred in Washington, D.C., featuring their congressional counterparts, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., the city would have been abuzz. A week ago, Axios reported their shaky ceasefire was no more, and “the smack talk has gotten personal.”
Not so in Hartford, where Ritter and Candelora are in the sixth year of a legislative bromance of sorts. They are not averse to occasional smack-talking, but it’s always over their significant policy differences. As they say in the oft-quoted “The Godfather,” “It’s not personal, it’s strictly business.”
On Wednesday, they sat for public questioning by John Dankosky as part of The Connecticut Mirror’s “In the Room” series with the state’s elected leaders. Sprinkled through the audience were lobbyists who, like journalists, make a study of the Ritter-Candelora dynamic.
Thirty minutes into the one-hour conversation, they disagreed forcefully, albeit respectfully, over the state’s Trust Act and its various revisions, which limit official cooperation with federal ICE agents carrying out the Trump administration’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants. 
Candelora called the crackdown “a politically charged disaster.” 
But he faulted Connecticut’s laws as far too restrictive on the ability of law enforcement to cooperate with ICE, and he suggested that the tactics of some protesters are putting people in harm’s way, leading to fatal confrontations, like the shooting of Renee Good.
“What we saw with the killing in Minnesota, you know, that woman had no intention, I’m sure, of hitting an officer with her car,” Candelora said. “I think she also did not believe that she was going on a suicide mission.”
Ritter seemed relieved at the opportunity to disagree. Both men are mindful that their constructive working relationship can be double edged: Are they too cooperative? Does cooperation equate with a less-than-aggressive defense of the core differences between the Democratic majority and Republican minority?
“I don’t agree with what Vinnie just said, right?” Ritter said. “I’m proud of the Trust Act laws that we passed, and I think we should focus on the most dangerous people, whether they be American citizens or not.” He added, “Let there be no mistake. We don’t agree on everything. But I’m almost so glad that question came up and you could see that there are differences, and this is how you deal with it.”
There is potential for sharp differences this year in the three-month legislative session that opens on Feb. 4.
Ritter said the Democrats plan to implement no-excuse absentee voting, something possible due to an amendment to the state Constitution passed by voters in 2024. 
Despite vehement opposition from parents who home-school their children, Ritter said legislators also will be looking at limited new oversight of homeschooling, which now is virtually unregulated.
The impetus is the shocking case last year of a 32-year-old Waterbury man who authorities say was held captive by his stepmother after she pulled him out of school when he was 11. The family had interactions with child welfare authorities, but no one investigated the boy’s disappearance from school.
“If you’ve had a lot of interaction with DCF and law enforcement, you just suddenly withdraw your kid. We might need to have better follow-up on that,” Ritter said. “That might get really ugly, Republican versus Democrat. I think it depends how it gets drafted.”

Both leaders said school funding formulas also will be on the table, as will the state’s continuing struggle to meet the challenges created by federal spending cuts and other actions, some of which come with little notice and no explanation. Ritter and Candelora share frustration over the unpredictability coming from Washington.
Candelora said he and Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, wrote the Trump administration, questioning the rationale for twice shutting down construction of the offshore Revolution Wind project. Each time, a federal judge lifted the stop-work order.
Similarly, Candelora said, there was no explanation for why a provider of behavioral health services to schools in his district was informed this week that $600,000 in federal funding was being canceled, effectively immediately.
“They have not been given a reason to why that money has been clawed back,” Candelora said.
Candelora was among the Republicans who joined Democrats in creating a $500 million fund to respond to federal cuts, which can be spent at the discretion of Gov. Ned Lamont until the start of the session.
Ritter became speaker five years ago, the same time that Candelora became the Republican minority leader. But they developed a relationship earlier, working on a  bipartisan budget in 2017 that broke a protracted stalemate in Ritter’s first session as majority leader, his first leadership post.
Ritter was dubious about Republican overtures to be part of a budget deal, which would take away one of any minority party’s key tools: the ability to criticize the more unpopular portions of a tax-and-spending plan.
“Matt was the majority leader, and he came to me and he said, ‘You guys really serious about negotiating this? Are you just going to pull the rug out at the last minute?’ And that was at the very beginning of negotiations,” Candelora said.
Comptroller Sean Scanlon, a mutual friend, vouched for Candelora as substantive and trustworthy, Ritter said. 
At the time, Scanlon was a state representative from Guilford, a community that Candelora also represents. He met Candelora on election night in 2014, when he won his first term defeating a candidate backed by Candelora. Scanlon was impressed when Candelora stopped by his victory party.
“It’s nice to meet you, and I want you to know we’re going to work together on behalf of this town,” Scanlon recalled Candelora telling him. “And there was never a day after that day that I did not have a truly productive, good working relationship with him.”
Scanlon said Ritter and Candelora are institutionalists — “two guys who believe in the importance of institutions running well and who believe that the foundational principle of it running well is trust and communication, even when you disagree ideologically over things.”
Candelora, 55, was elected in 2006 to the 86th House District of Durham, East Haven, Guilford and North Branford. The district is 88% white, and the poverty rate is 3%.
Ritter, 42, was elected in 2010 from Hartford’s 1st District, representing the West End, Asylum Hill and a few blocks of the North End. As a white man, he is a racial minority in a district where one in five residents are white. The poverty rate is 25%, and half the population is considered low income.
Their political differences are many. Like every other Republican, Candelora opposed the omnibus housing bill passed in special session last year. But Ritter was stumped when Dankosky asked for an example of a difference that was especially difficult. Candelora was not.
“The religious exemption,” Candelora said.
“Oh, yeah,” Ritter said.
Their differences on Ritter’s successful push to end religious exemptions for school-age vaccinations were heated and unusually public. Mothers opposed to the vaccination mandate filled the Legislative Office Building, and the dispute became a national story.
The debate in the House stretched past midnight, a rarity during Ritter’s time as speaker.
“It was a difficult process to negotiate, and you had people very impassioned on each side,” Candelora said. “You couldn’t get consensus. And, you know, then it became the challenge of having to somehow figure out a way to turn the temperature down and get the bill to a vote.”
There was a compromise over the timetable for implementation, and the bill finally came to a vote.
Democrats hold a 102-49 advantage in the House, but Ritter said he soon will consult with Candelora about the Democratic agenda, if only to give him a heads up and inquire about potential areas of compromise or common ground.
“I can, because we’ve been dating for a while now,” Ritter said straight-faced, pausing briefly for the inevitable laugh. “I got a sense of where I think I could engage with him and where I probably couldn’t.”
At some point in the next three months, Candelora undoubtedly will denounce some element of that agenda, either over its substance or out of a need to rally a small GOP minority.
“I have to understand that Vinnie has a job, right?” Ritter said. “He’s got a job to do, and I have a job to do. I think we know that.”
It will upset some people at the state Capitol, but not the speaker or minority leader.
“A lot of people up there are much more sensitive,” Ritter said. “Vinnie and I have lost all sensitivity.”

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)More than 200 gathered Wednesday evening in Raleigh’s Moore Square to mourn Minneapolis activist Renee Good and to condemn ICE for her death and other violent encounters in recent months.
The candlelight vigil, organized by Siembra NC, included a call to prayer, the singing of the spiritual “Gospel Plow,” and remarks from activists and lawmakers. Mourners shielded their candles from the wind on a blustery night where temperatures hovered around 40°F. Some struggled to relight them after gusts blew them out.
The group held accompanying vigils in Charlotte, Greensboro and Wilmington, North Carolina.
Good’s fatal shooting by an ICE agent has sparked protests and condemnation across the U.S., including calls from members of Congress for U.S Dept. of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to resign or be impeached. Thousands demonstrated in Minneapolis last week to demand accountability for the shooting.
Alissa Vermilion, among those at Wednesday’s Raleigh vigil, said she came out to show her anger over violence by ICE.
“I’ve been outraged almost from the beginning about how brutal and how unaccountable ICE has been,” she said. “It’s infuriating to know that the only thing that I can do is to come out and peacefully protest and remember and hope that it’s enough to stop the brutality.”

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment on the protests. Noem and other officials have argued the ICE agent shot Good in self-defense during a vehicular assault, though video of the incident seems to show her steering away from the officer.
Wednesday’s demonstration blended memorial with protest. Attendees held small candles and bowed their heads for a moment of silence. Some raised signs reading, “We saw the video,” and “No PolICE State.” Some, concerned for their safety, wore masks to hide their identity.
John Arndt, who said he has been protesting the Trump administration since last spring with the grassroots anti-Trump group 50501, said he believes Good is the “tipping point” to turn Americans against ICE. “She wanted to make a difference. She made the ultimate difference,” he told NC Newsline.
Mourners shielded their candles from the wind on a blustery night where temperatures hovered around 40°F. Some struggled to relight them after gusts blew them out.

Nikki Marín Baena, co-founder of Siembra NC, told the crowd that it was up to them to keep immigrants and legal observers safe from violence.
“El mañana debe prometerse a todos. Tomorrow should be promised for everyone,” she said. “Tonight we hold space for those whose tomorrow was stolen by federal violence in this last year. We say their names.”
In addition to Good, she asked the demonstrators to honor Silverio Villegas González, Keith Porter Jr., Jaime Alanis Garcia, Roberto Carlos Montoya Valdez, and Joe Castro Rivera, all of whom were allegedly either killed by ICE agents or died from other causes as they fled from encounters.
She also highlighted the case of Edwin Godinez and Yair Napolés, two U.S. citizens who say they were assaulted by ICE officers during a stop in Salisbury, North Carolina last week. Video from their phones appears to support their claims.
State Sen. Sophia Chitlik (D-Durham) said she and her Democratic colleagues will introduce the Making Enforcement Liable and Transparent, or MELT, Act in the legislature’s short session, aiming to prohibit federal law enforcement from wearing masks, block immigration detentions at churches, hospitals and schools, and open ICE and Border Patrol to civil litigation at the state level for violating North Carolinians’ rights.
“The burden is now on the states to protect our communities from the invasion of ICE and CBP. It is up to us state legislators to step up as fundamental American liberties like the right to assembly, due process and the rule of law are threatened,” she said.
Any successful measures to restrict ICE are unlikely to advance in the current North Carolina General Assembly, however, with a sizable Republican majority controlling both chambers.
In an interview after the vigil, Marín Baena said Siembra NC is discussing what precautions may help keep its trained community observers safe in the wake of Good’s death. Observers in Minnesota have made changes, but none have been implemented yet in N.C.
She said she was surprised by the “incredible” turnout in Raleigh.
“I wasn’t expecting so many people with the cold. But I think it does confirm what we thought, which is that a lot of people don’t want to see this in our community,” she said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1145243-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-14 23:57:33.435047

Patrick Morrisey gives his second State o the State address at the state Capitol in Charleston, West. Virginia on Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026. (Photo by Perry Bennett/West Virginia Legislative Photography)Gov. Patrick Morrisey on Wednesday delivered the 2026 State of the State address, doubling down on his request for an income tax cut and asking the Legislature to fund flood prevention.
It was the governor’s second State of the State address, and the hour-long speech struck a tone similar to his first, including praising President Donald Trump. While the speech was broken up into nearly 20 different topic areas — everything from broadband infrastructure, energy policies and flooding preparation to drugs, the border and small government — details and specific policies on those issues were sparse.
While he celebrated previous efforts to decrease rights for transgender people, cut red tape for businesses and expand school choice initiatives, no new information or next steps were shared regarding those efforts or several others. 
As opposed to last year — when a $400 million budget deficit loomed — Morrisey said that the state’s current ​​$128 million budget surplus will allow for more leeway in funding priorities. He was clear, however, that the state budget will remain “flat,” as it has in recent years.
Specifics that were given focused on increasing funds for certain projects, including $100 million dollars to supplement road and bridge repair work and $20 million to improve state parks.
Sen. Mike Oliverio, R-Monongalia
Morrisey wants lawmakers, who gaveled in Wednesday, to approve a 10% cut to the state’s personal income tax, pointing to budget surplus as reason to push it through. 
“We are also asking the Legislature to conform with the permanent tax changes signed into law by President [Donald] Trump,” he said. “Members of the House and Senate, we can afford this tax cut.”
Sen. Mike Oliverio, R-Monongalia, said lawmakers will have to see how a proposed tax cut “looks on paper.” The governor has already asked agencies to cut their budgets this year and some are facing a significant loss of federal funding due to Trump’s budget cuts.
“We’re going to have to hear a lot more to understand how we’re going to cut agencies by 2%, but reduce taxes by 10%,” Oliverio said. 
W.Va. House Minority Leader Del. Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell
House Minority Leader Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell, said he wasn’t sure a tax cut was fiscally responsible, pointing to the state’s declining revenue collections.
“That seems like we don’t really have a plan. We’re just doing things for campaign fodder, right?” he said. 
The governor also requested a 3% pay raise for all state workers.
Sen. Brian Helton, R-Fayette
Flooding prevention is also a priority for Morrisey, and he asked lawmakers for $10 million to fund a new flooding preparation initiative that aims to modernize how the state detects flood risk and warns the public. 
“By expanding sensors in key areas, we can build predictive models and react to leading indicators instead of lagging indicators,” Morrisey said. “Those forecasts promise to identify flood risk one to six hours ahead with a target accuracy of more than 90%. This is about protecting lives.”
Sen. Brian Helton, R-Fayette, said the flooding prevention money was fantastic news for Southern West Virginia. 
“We were devastated through Wyoming, McDowell County, parts of Raleigh and even Fayette County. We took a big hit this last year,” he said. “To hear the governor’s remarks tonight, and that funding is available, means so much to our families and our communities. I’m just really
excited about it.”
Morrisey didn’t share plan for skyrocketing utility costs  
While the governor opened his speech lamenting “significant increases in all forms of energy” prices for West Virginians and an ever-growing need for more electricity production, Morrisey did not share any plans or thoughts on how the state should control those costs for consumers.
Republicans in the state House of Delegates have said they want to prioritize legislation this session to ease the burden of increased energy prices on residents. To date, however, no specific legislation has been shared that would do so.
Morrisey lauded last year’s passage of House Bill 2014 (the microgrid and data center bill) and his still-to-be-developed “50 by 50” plan, which aims to see the state increase its electric generating capacity to 50 gigawatts by 2050. 
He did not, however, announce any new energy-related policies he would like to see explored or adopted by the Legislature.
Little focus on West Virginia’s poor health outcome 
For a second year, there was little focus given on the state’s poor health outcomes or efforts to turn them around. Morrisey mostly spoke about his ongoing “Mountaineer Mile” initiative — which asks every resident to try and walk a mile a day — and lauded policies adopted last year to remove a list of colorful dyes from food (an effort that’s been held up in courts) and stop residents from purchasing soda with their federal food benefits.
Hornbuckle said it “was highly disturbing” that the governor didn’t talk about health care needs in the state.
West Virginia per capita in 2021 led the nation in deaths caused by cancer (184.7 deaths per 100,000), drug overdoses (90.9), diabetes (47.6) and kidney disease (25.8), according to mortality data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The state is also set to lose federal Medicaid money that will impact hospitals’ budgets.
“We are set to lose over a billion dollars to health care. He did not talk about that. … It’s going to lead to rural hospital closures. That is something that really stuck out to me,” Hornbuckle said.
Regarding the state’s ongoing drug and overdose epidemic, Morrisey shared no new priorities and instead praised Trump’s efforts to “secure” the nation’s southern border and “fight crime.”
Morrisey did not mention Certificate of Need repeal, a priority of his last year that resoundingly died twice in the state House of Delegates.
The most specific requests came from Morrisey asking lawmakers to “support” the new Rural Health Transformation Program by “advancing legislative initiatives” to “promote prevention, wellness and personal responsibility.” He said he wants to see student doctors trained on nutrition, more efforts to educate the public on “new dietary guidelines” and the reinstatement of the Presidential Fitness test.
Regarding the Public Employees Insurance Agency, Morrisey said Wednesday that progress has been made to slow the rising health care costs faced by state employees. He called on lawmakers to “work with me on real reforms” for the state insurance agency, but didn’t specify what those reforms might be. 
“I was pleased to see the commitment to the public employee pay raise, but really believe we need to do more than that, and we need to help them with their PEIA premiums,” Oliverio said. 
Later this year PEIA will raise health insurance premiums by 3%. In July, their rates went up by 14%. 
Many of the governor’s other requests had been previously announced in press conferences, including his idea to invest $6 million dollars for a “Bring Them Home Fund” to build “world-class centers of care” for foster children. Morrisey plans to bring hundreds of foster children living in out-of-state facilities back to West Virginia after opening the new in-state facilities. The state spent $70 million last year paying for foster children to live in out-of-state facilities around the country.
“This approach will save our state tens of millions of dollars and provide our children the stability, care and foundation they need to grow, heal, and prosper,” Morrisey said. “Let’s bring our kids home, where they belong.”

A campaign website went live with a donation page not yet active. She has yet to register as a candidate, a step required before raising or spending money.
WTNH, Channel 8 and the New York Post, which has published her columns, reported her announcement.
McCaughey makes her debut as a Connecticut candidate at age 77 with a profile in national right-wing politics but facing a difficult task for qualifying for public financing by raising $250,000 in small-dollar donations. 
The other two Republicans in the race, former New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart and Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich, have crossed the $250,000 threshold, and Stewart’s campaign already has received a convention grant of more than $800,000.
WTNH reported that McCaughey was asked by a woman if she could win the endorsement of President Donald Trump.
“I will say this,” McCaughey responded. “I’m running on my own, but it’s very possible President Trump will support me.”
The Democratic Governors Association was quick to associate her with Trump.
“Betsy McCaughey has spent the last years of her career shilling for Donald Trump’s deeply unpopular agenda that is driving up costs for middle-class families,” the DGA said. “The last thing Connecticut families need right now is a Trump mouthpiece as their governor.”
McCaughey grew up in Westport and returned to Connecticut after living in New York. She now resides in Greenwich. She was briefly married in the 1990s to Wilbur Ross, the wealthy financier and former U.S. Commerce secretary.
She has been broadly hinting at a campaign in recent weeks, visiting other Republican town committees and criticizing Gov. Ned Lamont over the high cost of living in Connecticut.
McCaughey read a poem that places her on the side of homeowners and property tax payers, not renters, WTNH said.
“I wrote a little jingle for you,” she said. “Owners vote red. Renters vote blue. Fight for homeowners. It will make a winner out of you.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC01321.jpg,,,2026-01-15 00:57:25.575169

Mike Braun gives his second State of the State address in the House chamber on Jan. 14, 2026. (Photo by Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Gov. Mike Braun delivered a State of the State speech Wednesday night that was heavy on achievements, light on new goals and with a few football callouts.
“With our strong business environment, it’s not surprising that another organization has noticed that Indiana is open for business: the Chicago Bears,” he said. “We are working hard to bring the Chicago Bears to the Hoosier State.”
But most of the address focused on affordability for Hoosiers — from electric bills and rent to property taxes and child care.
“Affordability is our highest priority,” Braun told General Assembly members gathered in the Indiana House chamber.
“Together,” he continued, “we can make Indiana the state where your dollar goes further, where opportunity abounds for all who are willing to work hard, and where every Hoosier worker can build the life they deserve.”
Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray called it a good speech.
“He talked about some of the highlights and the really good story that Indiana has to tell,” he said.
Braun didn’t mention the bitter December redistricting battle that has strained some relationships in the Statehouse. Braun specifically said Bray and other Senate Republicans who opposed redistricting should lose their seats.
“There’s lots of hard things that happen in this place,” Bray said after Braun’s speech. “We are going to continue to come to work and do good work for Hoosiers, and look forward to working with the governor for that and with the House as well.”
Democrats pointed to numerous ways that Republicans are now hopping on the affordability bandwagon, giving examples of bills that the Democratic caucuses have offered in recent years but that Republicans rejected.
“If Statehouse Republicans wanted to lower cost, they would have already done that by now,” said House Democratic Leader Phil GiaQuinta. “They’ve been in charge for the past 20 years, and Gov. Braun is catching up the fact that Hoosiers are struggling.
Backing these bills
Braun didn’t unveil a typical legislative agenda for his office, instead simply announcing support for several bills already moving through the legislative process.
For instance, he said he supports Republican Rep. Alaina Shonkwiler’s bill to protect Hoosiers from unnecessary utility rate hikes.

While on the topic of energy, Braun issued a full-throated declaration of support for data centers. The behemoth centers have roiled numerous Indiana communities with Hoosiers concerned about electricity and water usage.
“AI is going to be key to the jobs and wages of the future, but data centers can’t stick Hoosiers with the power bill,” Braun said. “Companies that want big power in Indiana should pay their own way.”
That goal isn’t fully codified but rather an informal policy in negotiations for state support.
He specifically hailed Amazon building a $1.5 billion data center in northwest Indiana, saying “they’re going to pay for every cent of their power needs, and then some.”
Moving to homeownership, Braun said he supports a bill from GOP Rep. Doug Miller, R-Elkhart, to remove government hurdles and make it easier for Hoosiers to chase the American dream of owning a home.
“Home prices have surged because we aren’t building enough, and unnecessary regulations are driving up costs,” he said.
He also announced support for bills to limit cellphone use in schools; ensure that parents have veto power over their kids’ creating social media accounts; curb homelessness in public spaces and a constitutional change to make it easier to hold accused criminals in jail pre-trial.
Braun said affordable child care is needed to grow the Indiana economy and help Hoosiers get better jobs. But that specific priority item will have to wait a year.
“I look forward to digging in during the budget session (in 2027) on what we can do to invest in lowering child care costs,” he said. “I would like to see a program where businesses have skin in the game to help grow child care programs.”
But under his watch, the administration has cut reimbursement rates and capped child care vouchers for low-income parents. That has led to waitlists and day care centers closing around the state.
Senate Democratic Leader Shelli Yoder, of Bloomington, said child care deserts are spreading and parents are on waitlists for years.

“Costs are higher. Workers are leaving jobs they want because care does not exist. That did not happen by accident. It happened because child care was treated as an afterthought,” she said. “Child care is not an option, it’s an economic infrastructure.”
But GOP House Speaker Todd Huston pushed back, saying Republicans have passed measures to improve child are options, such as deregulation and tax credits for businesses to get involved.
“The best thing we can do is help support more supply and the government’s not going to be the best avenue to do that,” Huston said. “The best avenue to do that is reduce the regulations and let a lot of these folks that used to provide child care provide child care without having the burden of of all these government regulations that just do nothing but drive up costs.”
Kudos to Indiana
Braun also took time to list key accomplishments for his administration during his first year in office.
He reminded Hoosiers that he pushed a property tax bill that will save taxpayers $1.5 billion over the next three years. He has no plans for more property tax changes this year.
Braun pointed to cuts in state government that are making state agencies leaner and more efficient. He specifically applauded Indiana’s Medicaid program for finding $465 million in savings.
These savings have come through increased eligibility checks, tightened regulations and cuts to some programs.

“We’re continuing to deliver high-quality essential services that Hoosiers rely on, while you keep more of your money — because it’s not ours, it’s yours,” Braun said.
The education front also provided key highlights, with increased reading scores, a record-high graduation rate and new school accountability grades coming soon.
Braun also noted that Indiana’s real GDP is growing faster than the national rate and listed a string of big jobs announcements from recent months.
“Project after project, industry after industry, the story is the same: Indiana is the Midwest’s growth engine for more jobs and bigger paychecks,” he said.
Additionally, the governor listed public safety wins and efforts at retraining Hoosier workers.
Lawmakers gave two standing ovations for law enforcement and also included a “Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoosiers” chant at one point.
Braun ended the speech with a nod to the Indiana Hoosiers playing for the national college football championship on Monday night.
“My administration has people from up and down the state. We have Butler fans, Notre Dame fans, Purdue fans … but on Monday I expect to see all of them wearing cream and crimson. Go Hoosiers!”
He also said a 9-year-old from Shoals, Jack Gibson, asked whether the governor could delay the start of school on Tuesday morning so he could stay up late and watch the Hoosiers win on Monday.
“I like the sound of that,” Braun said. “I’ll leave it up to each school district to decide, but I think that sounds like a good idea.”

Gov. Tim Walz encouraged Minnesota residents to carry their phones at all times to record federal immigration actions, promising during a statewide address on Wednesday night that “accountability is coming” for abuses by federal officers.
“Help us create a database of the atrocities against Minnesotans, not just to establish a record for posterity but to bank evidence for future prosecution,” Walz said. 
Walz made the remarks during a six-minute address on Wednesday night as the state confronts a surge of between 2,000 and 3,000 agents, as well as widespread reports of violence against citizens and immigrants alike, including the killing of Renee Good last week. 
“News reports simply don’t do justice to the level of chaos and disruption and trauma the federal government is raining down upon our communities,” Walz said. 
The Trump administration has only intensified its focus on immigration actions in the state since Good’s killing and calls by Democratic leaders to end it. 
Minnesota and the Twin Cities are suing the Trump administration, alleging that the increased federal actions are unconstitutional and a violation of federal law. U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez said in a Wednesday hearing that there wasn’t enough time to make an informed ruling on state officials’ request for an injunction to stop “further legal violations and unlawful escalations” by federal agents reporting to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
Walz renewed the call for ICE to leave on Wednesday evening, telling President Donald Trump and Noem: “End this occupation. You’ve done enough.” 
Walz and Minnesota Democrats have also condemned the administration for ending a joint investigation into the Good killing; the Department of Justice kicked the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension off the case, though local prosecutors say they’ll continue to investigate. A group of six federal prosecutors quit this week in protest over the U.S. Department of Justice’s push to investigate Good, her widow and their ties to anti-ICE activists, the New York Times reported.  
Walz warned the federal focus on Minnesota may only get more intense in the near future, pointing to Trump’s recent Truth Social post that said, “FEAR NOT, GREAT PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA, THE DAY OF RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING!”
Walz encouraged Minnesotans to continue protesting peacefully and said this operation can’t last forever. 
“We will not have to live like this forever,” Walz said. “Accountability is coming at the voting booth and in court. We will reclaim our communities from Donald Trump. We will reestablish a sense of safety for our neighbors, and we will bring an end to this moment of chaos, confusion and trauma.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-14-at-8.25.35 PM-1024x707.png,,,2026-01-14 21:56:46.893578

(Photo by AAron Ontiveroz/The Denver Post, Pool)A trio of Colorado judges in a hearing Wednesday brushed aside the most sweeping arguments made by attorneys for former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters in her appeal of her criminal convictions — but the panel expressed serious concerns about a procedural error in one of her felony charges and the overall fairness of her sentence.
The oral arguments presented by Peters’ attorneys and the state attorney general’s office to the Colorado Court of Appeals, the state’s second-highest court, were the latest episode in a scattershot campaign of legal maneuvering and political coercion seeking the release of the prominent election conspiracy theorist, who is serving a nine-year sentence in state prison for her role in a 2021 breach of her office’s secure voting equipment.
A Mesa County jury convicted Peters on multiple felony counts in a 2024 trial during which the county’s former top elections official continued to spread conspiracy theories about voting machines, including in a rambling 40-minute statement just before her sentencing.

But Judges Craig Welling, Ted Tow III and Lino Lipinsky de Orlov of the appellate court raised concerns about that trial during Wednesday’s hearing, questioning whether an improper jury instruction led to Peters’ conviction on a felony charge despite drawing language from a misdemeanor statute. More broadly, the panel appeared sympathetic to arguments made by Peters’ attorneys that her sentencing — which followed statements made by presiding District Court Judge Matthew Barrett calling Peters a “charlatan” who peddled “snake oil” — violated her right to free speech.
“My read of the (sentencing) transcript is that the judge considered that, and it went into the calculation of the sentence,” Welling said. “And that’s a First Amendment problem.”
He added that the issue “fundamentally calls into question the fairness of the sentence.”
 Peters’ appeal asks the court to dismiss the case against her entirely, or else remand it to the district court for further proceedings.

Question of jurisdiction
Since President Donald Trump’s return to power in 2025, Peters’ allies, including senior administration officials, have worked to bring about her release through a series of overlapping legal maneuvers, including the appeal of her criminal case; a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court; a Department of Justice request seeking her transfer to federal custody; and a presidential pardon that does affect her state-level conviction.
Though the Court of Appeals case is a direct appeal of her criminal conviction, Peters’ attorneys have also sought to use it as a venue to test an unsupported legal theory holding that the presidential pardon power applies to state charges. A filing in the case last month asked the court to “enter an order indicating that it lost jurisdiction and finding that … the Pardon which was issued on Dec. 5, 2025, was effective and vitiated the convictions against Tina Peters in the State of Colorado.”
The pardon issue wasn’t raised at all during Wednesday’s hearing. John Case, one of Peters’ attorneys, instead reiterated a handful of other arguments made in briefs before the court, including a claim that Peters was immune from prosecution under the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy clause because she was carrying out her duty to preserve election records under federal law — and, further, that the merits of such an argument can’t be decided by state courts.
“Our position is that state courts have no jurisdiction to determine supremacy clause immunity,” Case said.

That prompted a bemused reaction from the appellate judges, who noted that two federal courts had previously rejected attempts to remove Peters’ criminal trial to the federal level.
“If you’re right, and we can’t decide it — then doesn’t the conviction just stand?” Welling said to Case. “I’m not sure you really want what you’re asking for.”
Erroneous language
The charges on which Peters was convicted included a felony count of conspiring to commit criminal impersonation, stemming from her misrepresentation of election conspiracy theorist Conan Hayes as a county employee, Gerald Wood, during the 2021 secure elections software update at the center of the case.
Peters’ indictment, and the instruction to the jury in her trial, erroneously included language drawn from the criminal statute for misdemeanor impersonation. The misdemeanor standard requires only that the crime “might” have exposed the impersonated individual to liability, while the felony charge requires the liability to be proved. The appeals panel noted that the felony conviction in question added 15 months to Peters’ prison sentence.

The state’s appellate brief contends that this is not a “reversible error,” because “the evidence overwhelmingly established that the conduct would and did subject Mr. Wood to criminal liability.”
“I am baffled as to the position that’s being taken — that we can somehow overlook that … because the evidence that was presented at trial would have supported the felony,” Welling said.
“I understand it’s a difficult position for the people to be in,” said Lisa Kay Michaels of the attorney general’s office, who represented the state.
Michaels also argued that the trial court judge’s comments during sentencing about Peters’ role in spreading election conspiracy theories was distinct from the reasoning he gave for the severity of her sentence.
“I think the court made some comments, and then, the court, if you look at the transcript, talks about the basis of the sentence, which is her criminal conduct,” she said.
Pressure on Polis
Concurrently with Peters’ legal appeals, the Trump administration has launched an unprecedented pressure campaign targeting Colorado, including the veto of a unanimously passed bill to fund a southern Colorado water project, the denial of two disaster declaration requests, and the proposed dismantling of Boulder’s National Center for Atmospheric Research. The moves follow Trump’s threat to take “harsh measures” against Colorado if Peters wasn’t released, and an unnamed senior official last month appeared to acknowledge their retaliatory motive in comments to the New York Times.
Since last year, Gov. Jared Polis has maintained that he will review any request for a pardon or commutation for Peters as he would any other request. But he appeared to go further in an interview with CBS Colorado last week, for the first time describing Peters’ sentence as “harsh.”
The comment has again raised alarm bells among Colorado elections officials, including Secretary of State Jena Griswold and the Colorado County Clerks Association, who in a joint letter Tuesday renewed their repeated requests to Polis not to grant leniency to Peters.
“Peters was found guilty of seven felonies and misdemeanors by a jury of her peers, in conservative Mesa County,” the letter said. “Today, she remains one of the only people to face real accountability for attacking American elections. She has taken no responsibility for her actions and has shown no remorse.”
The letter — signed by Griswold, CCCA director Matt Crane and Hayle Johnson, the Republican Jackson County Clerk and CCCA president — said a pardon or commutation of Peters’ sentence would “embolden election denialism in Colorado and across the country.”
“It would send a loud message to those who would attack our elections and democracy that they too may have immunity. It also would send the demoralizing message to those of us who protect our elections and democracy — our county clerks, their staff, election judges, and Secretary of State staff — that our work is meaningless.”

The cuts will make it more difficult for frontline groups to provide treatment and harm reduction care that has been crucial to combating overdose deaths, and breaking the cycles of addiction and housing insecurity. Resources like Narcan medication used to save lives by reversing overdoses, peer support, and treatment access could dry up, just as communities nationwide began to see reductions in overdose deaths.
The U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), which issued the letters, hasn’t yet commented on the cuts. There are 30 SAMHSA-funded opioid treatment programs scattered across Wisconsin including in Appleton; Beloit, Eau Claire, Fond Du Lac, Green Bay, Madison, Milwaukee, Oshkosh, Kenosha, and others, according to the agency’s website. One of those programs, Vin Baker Recovery, is named after a Milwaukee Bucks basketball team player and assistant coach.
Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley condemned the sudden funding cuts. “The Trump administration’s cuts are not just numbers on a budget sheet; they are threats to the wellbeing of real people — our neighbors, our families, and our loved ones,” Crowley said in a statement. “While I will continue fighting for funding and resources to deliver results for our most vulnerable communities, the federal government must recognize the urgent need to preserve these vital services. These cuts cannot stand, because the lives of Wisconsinites depend on it.” 
A Milwaukee County Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) spokesperson said that so far, no termination letters have been sent to the county. DHHS received $13.9 million in direct SAMHSA funds, with $6.2 million remaining as of December. The county also receives another $15.3 million in state mental health and substance use disorder grants which  partially consist of federal funding through SAMHSA.
In an emailed statement the spokesperson said that “any termination of SAMHSA funding would result in immediate termination of mental health and substance use services in Milwaukee County.” Wisconsin’s most populous county has no other funding alternatives, and the loss of federal grant money would lead to more hospitalizations and higher incarceration rates, the spokesperson warned.
Elizabeth Goodsitt, a spokesperson for Wisconsin’s Department of Health Services (DHS) wrote in an email statement Wednesday that the department was “notified late yesterday that effective January 13, the Tribes of Wisconsin Prescription Drugs/Opioid Overdose-Related Deaths Prevention Program (PDO) grant has been terminated by the federal government.” Goodsitt described this as “part of a much larger set of cancellations across the country for federally funded projects that provided life-saving mental health and substance use disorder services.” 
Wisconsin had received nearly $1 million to operate the PDO until August 2026. The program was in the third year of a five-year grant. “The goal of the PDO is to save lives,” said Goodsitt. “The funding supports training first responders and other key community sectors on overdose prevention strategies, and it supports the purchase and distribution of naloxone, the overdose reversal medication for opioids.” 
For now the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin and the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents have not received termination letters regarding SAMHSA funding. Native American communities are disproportionately affected by overdose deaths in Wisconsin at a rate of 75.4 people per 100,000 in 2023, as compared to a rate of 20 people per 100,000 for white Wisconsin residents. 
“We are assessing all avenues possible to ensure the federal government is following all requirements in these existing funding agreements,” said Goodsitt. “While there continues to be much uncertainty about this evolving situation, we will keep working to serve Wisconsinites and support their behavioral health needs. We will continue to closely monitor this situation and will share more information as it becomes available.”

Joseline A. Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George's and Anne Arundel) is sworn in Wednesday as Maryland's House speaker. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Maryland’s newly minted House speaker said she wants an ad hoc budget committee of senior legislative officials to meet on the budget Gov. Wes Moore (D) is expected to deliver to the General Assembly next week.
The governor vowed his spending plan would include general fund spending that is less than the current year as well as no tax increases, all while resolving a projected $1.5 billion budget gap.
The Senate will get the first opportunity to make changes to that budget.
House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) said in an interview at The Daily Record’s Eye on Annapolis opening day event, that she has asked for a series of regular meetings between the two chambers.
“What I want to do, and I have expressed this to the Senate president, is for us to come together early,” Peña-Melnyk said. “And we have actually agreed on putting together a budget committee where the Senate (president), myself and the chair and vice chair of the budget committees will meet with staff, so that we can have discussions first, right? It’s best not to have surprises, so that we can again, have a meeting of the minds and have agreement as well.”
Both presiding officers said they agreed with crafting a budget that does not increase taxes.
“People are having a hard time,” Peña-Melnyk said. “This is a session to find relief and to get help.”

The speaker in a meeting with reporters stressed her focus on “bread and butter” affordability issues, stressing that those were the most important issues that she believed needed to be tackled this year. She talked about a daughter who lives in Baltimore who has been keeping her apartment heated at 60 degrees because she cannot afford a higher utility bill.
“Those are the issues that people care about. It’s about energy right? Those energy bills. It’s about health care,” she said. “With everything that is happening at the federal level, people are very nervous. So this session, we have to really focus…. This session is about giving people relief, and that is my focus.”
Poll: Trump remains unpopular in Maryland
President Donald Trump remains deeply unpopular in Maryland, according to a poll released Wednesday.
“The numbers reveal a dynamic that feels baked into Maryland’s political DNA: A presidency that commands fierce devotion from a minority and equally fierce rejection from a minority,” Patrick Gonzales, director of the poll, said in a release.
In the poll by Gonzales Research & Media, 36% said they approved of the job the president is doing and 63% disapproved. Of that, 90% of Democrats rejected Trump’s performance. A roughly equal number of Republicans said they approved.
The poll of 808 registered Maryland voters who said they were likely to vote in 2026 was conducted between Dec. 21 and Jan. 6. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.5%.
Trump’s approval numbers are nearly identical to his election results in the state in 2024, when the now-second-term president won 34% of the vote to then-Vice President Kamala Harris’ nearly 63%.
Six in 10 of those polled rated Trump’s handling of the economy as poor, while a combined 32% gave him “good” or “excellent” marks for the economy. The poll also found deep concerns about rising costs of living, with 67% saying costs were worse than last year. Another 24% said it was about the same. Just 9% said costs are better than last year.
Union wants better deal
Leaders of one of the state’s largest public employee unions called on lawmakers to do more to improve pay and working conditions for Maryland government employees.

The demands were part of a legislative package rolled out by leaders of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees at a news conference an hour before the start of the 2026 General Assembly session.
“I want to be crystal clear about our demands and needs from the state leaders,” said Patrick Moran, president of AFSCME Council 3. “We must invest in our state government. We must protect public servants who show up every day, often in dangerous conditions and at the expense of time with their families to serve and protect Marylanders. Our membership keeps Maryland running, and it’s time the state’s budget reflects that reality.”
The union is one of the largest in the state with more than 50,000 members in Maryland, including roughly 26,000 in state government. It remains at odds with Gov. Wes Moore (D) after rejecting a proposed contract that would offer AFSCME workers a roughly 2% increase, which the union said does not keep up with inflation.
Moore said he will include the increase in the budget.
Moran said when his union’s employees do better the state does better.
“It is our job to ensure that state services are adequately provided for the people of Maryland, that they are resourced, and that the people doing those jobs have the resources they need in order to provide for their families, and they are not falling behind,” Moran said. “Any time that we’ve seen this over the years, especially during the previous administration, that if our members do not keep up with the rate of inflation, then community suffer because the economy, it all slides downhill.”
Republicans want more oversight of departments with bad audits
A recent batch of bad fiscal audits of some state agencies has House Republicans calling for an investigative committee.
“These weren’t things that we cooked up. These are things that came out of DLS [the Department of Legislative Services] and other places, and the numbers are staggering,” said House Minority Leader Jesse Pippy (R-Frederick). “I mean, we’re at a point now where we misplaced or misappropriated or are fraudulently overcharging billions of dollars. It’s insane. So we’re at a point now where Maryland citizens are demanding accountability.”

Over the last year, the Joint Audit Committee has received reports from Office of Legislative Audits outlining $761 million in unemployment insurance overpayments that cannot be clawed back, more than $300 million on unauthorized charges on highway projects receiving federal funding, and the death of a Kanaiyah Ward, 16, who was in state custody when her body was found Sept. 22 in a room at a Baltimore hotel.
Typically, legislative budget committees will withhold budget money to get departments to correct problems identified in audits. But Pippy and other lawmakers note that the amounts withheld are frequently inconsequential.
“We cannot simply wait for another additional audit to catch these activities, or for whistleblowers to come forward,” Pippy said. “Marylanders want and deserve answers now, the powers of any investigative committee are prescribed in statute and include the ability to subpoena, take testimony under oath, and hold individuals in contempt for failing to comply.”
Members of the joint audit committee have expressed frustration with agencies that have repeated audit findings. In November, Legislative Auditor Brian Tanen said the number of repeat findings has increased to 34%.
““I don’t think it’s more auditing that’s necessary,” Tanen told lawmakers at the time. “I think it’s more fixing that’s necessary. We provide the recommendations. Ultimately, it’s the agencies that are responsible for putting the fixes in place. And I think what we’re finding is whether it’s because of a lack of adequate IT or human resources that those agencies oversee, controls those they’re just not doing it.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC00677-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-15 03:58:10.559308

I.
The state troopers came first for Tupe Smith. 
They arrived in a pair on November 30, 2023, travelling a stretch of highway that starts in Anchorage but quickly becomes quite rural. They drove past a ski resort and a small shopping center, then turned off through a forested valley with no cell service, until they reached the entrance to the longest highway tunnel in the country: the portal to Whittier, Alaska. 
The one-lane tunnel, which carves 2.5 dark, musty, bumpy miles through a glacial mountain, opens for two 15-minute periods every hour, once for each direction; the troopers caught the 10 a.m. window heading east. On the other side, Whittier’s punishing microclimate—more snow than Aspen, Amazon-level rainfall, and almost nonstop wind—greeted them with cold, wet bluster.
This small port town was built by the military during World War II, as the U.S. warred with Japan. In the 1950s during the Cold War, the military constructed two gigantic housing structures, one of which is still in use: The 14-story complex, set back a few blocks from the waterfront, houses nearly all of Whittier’s roughly 300 residents. Inside this tower, people shop for groceries, get mail, attend church, exercise, and gather in community. The officers parked their Ford Explorer outside the complex. 
Smith is part of a large, tight-knit community of people who’ve moved to Whittier from American Samoa, a U.S. territory some 5,000 miles across the Pacific Ocean. She’s called this complex home for years, so when the troopers knocked at the door of her third-floor unit, she didn’t bother to look through the peephole before opening it; in Whittier, there are no strangers. 
She had just fed breakfast to her children, one a kindergartener and the other an 11-month-old. Her husband, Mike Pese, a first responder, had worked a late shift and was still sleeping.
“You got a few minutes to talk?” Sergeant Nathan Bucknall asked when Smith opened up. He read out her Miranda rights.

The month prior, on Oct. 3, Smith had been elected to the local school board. She hadn’t particularly wanted to run, but had been urged over several years by teachers at Whittier’s school, which serves grades pre-K to 12 in a single building. The student body is so small that some years nobody graduates. Though the school is mere steps from the apartment tower, students often commute via an underground walking tunnel connecting the two buildings. It’s possible to pass many consecutive days in Whittier without ever stepping outside.
Smith, a frequent volunteer at the school, revered educators from a young age; her aunt, a special-ed teacher, had always been especially good with Smith’s little sister, Eseta, who has Down syndrome. Growing up in American Samoa, Smith dreamed of becoming a teacher herself one day, and in 2011 enrolled in college courses to that end. But when Eseta’s medical needs outgrew American Samoa’s health care system, Smith dropped out of college and accompanied her sister to California. There, she connected on Facebook with Pese, who grew up in her village and had himself moved to the U.S. mainland, and they fell in love. The couple moved to Alaska in 2017 to be close to Pese’s mother Mili, a pillar of Whittier’s Samoan community who owns Kozy Korner, the grocery store inside the apartment complex, and leads youth services at the church in the basement. 
At the Whittier school, Smith read to and cooked for the kids, more than half of whom were Samoan. Smith speaks Samoan, so was a valuable aide to the many students who were still learning English. Her pancakes were a hit with the kids and, during the COVID pandemic, she prepared and delivered meals to their apartments.
There wasn’t much of a candidate pool in such a small town, so Smith was an obvious choice for the school board. She ran unopposed and won, with 106 votes.
And that, she learned, is what brought the Alaska State Troopers through the Whittier tunnel on that wet November morning. In registering to vote and filing to run, Smith violated election law, Bucknall explained. “The voting integrity system is actually held pretty high up,” he said. “It’s got to be protected.”
Unbeknownst to Smith at the time, she had no right to vote in Whittier elections, much less run for office. Though she was born in a U.S. territory, and has a U.S. passport and Social Security number, she is not a U.S. citizen. American Samoa is the only U.S. state or territory where people are born without automatic citizenship, and without the right to vote in state, federal, and most local elections anywhere outside of American Samoa.
Unlike people born in the other U.S. territories of Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoans are classified simply as “U.S. nationals”—a sort of limbo state that acknowledges they are American by birth, but still denied the full rights and privileges of citizenship. 
Even though they pay taxes, owe “allegiance” by law to the United States, and can join or be drafted into the military—American Samoans have long served in and died for the U.S. military at exceptionally high rates—non-citizen American Samoan nationals cannot register to vote, run for office, serve on juries, or hold any job requiring citizenship. Unless they can claim citizenship through a parent or grandparent, American Samoan nationals must apply for citizenship as though they were immigrants. That process can be costly, confusing, and long.
As non-citizen nationals, they exist in a formal underclass of democracy that precludes them from, for one, running for a local school board.
“I’m not saying you murdered someone or anything like that, OK?” Bucknall told Smith. “Unfortunately, I have some bad news here: There’s an arrest warrant out for you.”
Smith told the troopers she had no idea she’d done anything wrong. The fine print of American Samoa’s exclusion from full participation in U.S. democracy is not well understood by most people—including many American Samoans themselves, and even most Alaska officials. “I know that I cannot vote for the president,” Smith told the troopers. “I didn’t know that I can’t vote for anything else.”
As the troopers handcuffed Smith in front of her son and baby daughter, her husband, Pese, fought the urge to lash out in her defense. She tried to conceal her hands under a jacket so that neighbors would not notice the cuffs when the troopers perp-walked her out of the building and into their SUV. Smith sobbed silently in the car, through the tunnel and over a rainy 72-mile drive to a jail north of Anchorage. Pese followed in his own car, pulling off only to withdraw $500 to bail out his wife. At the jail, Smith was ordered to strip naked, and cried while officers searched her. She sat alone behind bars in a jail uniform, waiting to make bail, and cried some more.
“I felt so embarrassed, because people looked at me as this really nice girl who helped do all this good stuff, go to church every Sunday,” Smith told me when we met in August in Whittier. “I thought that I was doing something good with my life, having my kids in this place and volunteering.”
Smith recalled that she could hardly speak on the car ride home from jail. “The experience was something that I never thought, at my lowest, that I would go through,” she told me. “Especially seeing my children cry when they took me out in cuffs.
“That broke me.”

II.
Almost a year passed before the troopers returned to Whittier, this time to cast a far wider net.
Smith’s arrest warrant included 10 felony counts of voter misconduct. The state took five of them to a grand jury, which rejected three charges and indicted Smith on two counts that each carry five-year prison terms. 
But it turned out she wasn’t the only U.S. national in Whittier who was unsure of their voting rights and vulnerable to prosecution. In the months following Smith’s arrest, Bucknall investigated dozens of her relatives and neighbors; Whittier became a target for officials eager to track down—and to punish—illegal voting. 
There has long been confusion around the voting rights, or lack thereof, of American Samoans in Alaska, where they make up a greater share of the population than in any U.S. state but Hawaii. And plenty of non-citizen nationals in Alaska had been voting for years. It had never been an issue, mostly because few people were aware any issue existed. 
Many American Samoans have come to Alaska, the second-nearest U.S. state to the Pacific Islands, for education, jobs, and health care. And over the years, candidates for offices major and obscure across the state have solicited their votes. Government officials who register people to vote have often registered American Samoans and failed to give residents the option to identify as non-citizen U.S. nationals on official forms. The Alaska DMV, which doubles as a voter registration office, admits it did not include that option on its forms until 2022—well after Smith, Pese, and others in Whittier first were registered. 
The state has also recently admitted that it registered an unspecified number of non-citizens to vote between 2022 and 2024. Alaska’s own mistakes are causing problems beyond just Whittier: A couple in Kodiak could now be deported over their erroneous registrations, according to a new lawsuit filed just last month. 
“Hardly anybody knows the difference between a citizen and a national. Only lawyers know that,” Margaret Stock, an immigration attorney in Anchorage representing the Kodiak couple, told me. “The Alaska DMV or other entities of Alaska’s government are registering people to vote when they’re not citizens; they do it all the time.” She told me she knows of “dozens and dozens” of cases in which the state registered people who were not eligible.
In 2022, a year before Smith’s election, some Samoans in Anchorage founded a nonprofit group called Pacific Community of Alaska to tackle health and social disparities that widened during the pandemic. Anchorage was about to hold a mayoral election, and the nonprofit realized that many American Samoans had no clear understanding of whether they were eligible to participate. So the group contacted Alaska’s Division of Elections with a simple query: Could American Samoan nationals vote in local and state elections?
Pacific Community says the Division of Elections claimed it didn’t know the answer, and that it referred the nonprofit to Anchorage’s municipal elections office, which said it also didn’t know, and referred the nonprofit back to the state. The 2022 election arrived and Pacific Community still had no clear guidance, so it shared none with its members; some people did end up voting under questionable eligibility. “The people interpreting the laws don’t even understand the damn laws,” Tafi Toleafoa, Pacific Community’s director, told me over the summer.
It was not until 2024 that the state finally sent the group a letter with a firm answer: “If a person who is not a U.S. citizen registers or votes, legal penalties could apply.”
Over several months of interviews with a wide variety of Alaska officials, including state lawmakers, local elected leaders, and law enforcement personnel, I found that very few of them could define a U.S. national and that most had no knowledge of what non-citizen American Samoans can and cannot do by right. 
John Coghill, a Republican state lawmaker from 1999 to 2021, who served at different points as majority leader of both statehouse chambers, told me he didn’t even learn of the democratic exclusion of non-citizen nationals until 2025. In all his years legislating on voting and elections policy, he said, “The Samoan issue didn’t even come up.”
Toleafoa told me she’s personally aware of “more than 100” non-citizen American Samoans in Alaska who have voted in state or local elections. I met several such folks myself. 
“I walked into an elementary school to vote; I showed them my Alaska state ID and they handed me a ballot,” said one non-citizen American Samoan woman in Anchorage, who requested anonymity out of fear she’d be punished like Smith. “Me just even telling my story worries me. There was misinformation. They were confused, I was confused.”
III.
Just before Anchorage held its 2022 election, as Pacific Community was seeking clarity, Whittier held its own local election. Many Samoans there, including Smith and her family, united around Dan Blair, a former Whittier mayor who was seeking a comeback. It was an important election for Whittier, which was, and still is, at an economic and cultural crossroads. 
The area is abundant in natural wonders—the town is ringed by mountains and glaciers and waterfalls, and sits at the head of a magnificent deep-water bay—but it has struggled to capitalize on its resources. The single-lane tunnel, which didn’t even open to road traffic until 2000, is a frail connection to the outside world, and the town has few commercial offerings for tourists: hardly any lodging, a handful of restaurants and gift shops and tour companies, and a beat-up waterfront that isn’t very walkable. 
Still, dozens of cruise ships dock in Whittier every year, usually as a final stop before travelers fly home from Anchorage. A new, second cruise terminal has just opened in town, promising a projected 150,000 more annual visitors. But Blair and his supporters fear it could prove more curse than blessing. He believes Whittier must grow its economy, and sees great potential for new shops and restaurants to cater to all these new tourists, but he wants commercial leases and licenses to stay local, lest big business enter and snatch Whittier’s soul in the process.
“We’ve almost gone bankrupt as a city, at least twice,” Blair told me over a few Bud Lights at a dive bar on the edge of town. He looks and sounds like a windblown Woody Harrelson.
“Every time we get enough money to build a swingset, the thieves show up and take it out of the tunnel,” Blair said. He grumbled about newcomers, so-called “gentrifiers” who, in his view, are moving in to fancify Whittier and price out poor and middle-class locals. Things may be trending that way already; units inside the apartment complex that not long ago sold for $30,000 now command four or five times that amount.
Blair, who is white, is popular with Whittier’s Samoan population and among many of the town’s old-timers. 
“He’s for the community,” Smith’s husband, Pese, told me. But Blair is unpopular—loathed even, in some cases—among many of the newer, upwardly mobile residents whom he distrusts. Still, in 2022, Blair managed to get elected by 13 votes, 66 to 53, against a candidate more closely aligned with town administrators pursuing an aggressive plan for Whittier’s development. Smith, Pese, and many of their relatives were proud to support Blair.
“Some of the older regime don’t like change and I really believe that is the bottom line. So they stymie it,” said Blair critic Kelly Bender, a 30-year Whittier resident and head of the local chamber of commerce, who also owns a boat-charter company and a cafe at the waterfront. “I think the new people, voices new to Whittier, would like to see Whittier move forward, improve options for business, improve the looks of Whittier, open the door.”

In a town so tiny, the Samoan families comprised a powerful voting bloc easily large enough to have swung the 2022 election in Blair’s favor. Some locals started to chirp about this, including on a private Facebook forum called “What’s What in Whittier,” a very active and sometimes combative page administered by some of the “new” voices Bender spoke of. 
News of Tupe Smith’s arrest, which happened about a year after Blair’s win, spread quickly through the town. Her criminal case inflamed suspicions of those who resented the Samoans’ place in local politics, and, on December 30 of 2023, exactly a month after she’d been arrested, the state Division of Elections received an anonymous complaint alleging that “‘a large family group, many of whom were not U.S. Citizens,’ had also registered, and had voted in a recent election,” according to state documents. 
The complaint was referred to the Division of Alaska State Troopers, and Bucknall, the sergeant who’d arrested Smith, began a nearly year-long investigation. He combed through Whittier’s voter rolls in search of non-citizens, then sent the list to the federal Department of Homeland Security, which, documents show, concluded that some Whittier voters were not citizens, while the status of some others was “unclear.”
On Sept. 5, 2024, another rainy day in Whittier, the Alaska State Troopers returned through the tunnel, this time with a dozen cars, one of which carried a police dog. It was a highly unusual show of force from a department that in recent years has complained of a staff shortage so severe that it has not had capacity to train some officers or to address certain serious crimes. 
The team spread across Whittier, surprising people at the waterfront, at the town gas station, by the tunnel, and at apartment doors.
Karen Dempster, who runs the post office in the lobby of the complex, told me, “I’d gone out to get something from my unit and I see all these troopers, some in plainclothes and others in uniform. I said, ‘Is there a problem?’ They didn’t want to talk. While they’re waiting for the elevator they’re calling out names on their list.” All the names were Samoan, Dempster noticed. 
The troops fanned out in pairs, one of which headed for Smith’s unit. This time, when the knock came, she peered through the peephole; she’d learned well by then to fear police. But the troopers weren’t there for her. They wanted to speak with her husband.
Video of their interrogation of Pese shows that the police were also confused. “I thought people of American Samoa were U.S. citizens,” Trooper Richard Chambers said, fiddling with Pese’s passport at the kitchen table.

Pese said he was nervous to answer questions the “wrong” way. He told the troopers that he had thought he could vote in Alaska elections, but not in federal ones, and that he only learned U.S. nationals could not run for office once his wife was arrested. 
Neither did Chambers’ partner that day, Jason Knier, understand the law: Now that Pese and his family knew they couldn’t run for office, Knier suggested, the next best thing might be to find another like-minded Samoan candidate in Whittier who was a U.S. citizen. “Help them get elected. Campaign for them. Hang up signs,” Knier advised. “You can vote for that position, right? Because you can still vote in the state election.” This botched interpretation of the law came almost an hour into the interrogation.
“No, that’s what got us here,” Chambers reminded his partner.
Similar interviews were playing out all over town. Pese and Smith’s text message groups began to light up. No one was arrested that day, but nine months later, in May of 2024, Pese and nine other family members—his mom, his twin brothers, and a slew of cousins—received court summonses in the mail. They were all accused of felony voter misconduct, along with perjury, and they were due to appear in court in Anchorage. They each now face up to 10 years in prison.

Pese wonders if much of this trouble might have been averted by simple public education. As a child growing up in American Samoa, he remembers being taught about righteous American wars and the basics of U.S. government structure; he vividly recalls a lesson on Gettysburg. But he doesn’t remember ever being taught in school about American Samoa itself—about its history and role in the broader American empire, about why people born everywhere else in the country are citizens by birthright.
“Everyone speaks Samoan over there, but the main subjects we all have to pass were English, writing, math, and history,” he told me. “In the history books we learned from, it has nothing to do with the U.S. territory.”
American Samoa became a U.S. territory in 1900, having been previously governed in a shared power agreement among the U.S., England, and Germany over what were previously united Samoan lands. After 1900, the islands were broken up into two separate entities: the current territory of American Samoa and what is now the independent nation of Samoa. The U.S. Navy secured deeds of cession from Samoan chiefs in a colonial governance structure that ensured U.S. government control but promised preservation of local customs, including the governing authority of traditional chiefs.

This was a period of major American expansion around the globe. Military and economic ambitions, blessed by the Monroe Doctrine, led the U.S. to explode into a global imperial power, snatching up islands all over the world at feverish pace for their natural resources and strategic positioning. At one point, the U.S. controlled, either formally or informally, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Guam, and The Philippines, among other territories and countless unincorporated islands. 
American Samoa’s current status as a member of a democratic underclass was cemented starting in 1901 in a series of plainly racist U.S. Supreme Court rulings that stand to this day. The rulings together are known as the Insular Cases, which clarified that people living in U.S. territories, including American Samoa, were not entitled to the same constitutional protections as other Americans. The court called people living in the territories “alien races” and referred to colonial subjects as “savage tribes,” “uncivilized” and not practiced in “Anglo-Saxon principles.”
None of this was taught in school to Pese, nor to the many other American Samoans I met in Alaska. Pese said he didn’t know that other territories even existed until he was a teenager. He knew American Samoa was part of the U.S.—it’s in the name, after all—and it was instilled in him from a young age that he should be proud to be American. U.S. flags wave atop government buildings in American Samoa; July 4 and the NFL are as big, or bigger, there as in the mainland U.S. 
While people born in other U.S. territories eventually gained birthright citizenship, American Samoa never did, in large part because many islanders worry that giving automatic U.S. citizenship to people born on American Samoan soil would compromise the territory’s own sovereignty. American Samoa’s government has, in fact, formally opposed automatic citizenship for its people, out of fear that various local rules, including those that prohibit non-native Samoans from owning most property there, would be repealed as a result.
Pese says he never had to consider his ambiguous status as a non-citizen U.S. national until he moved to the mainland. “I pay the same taxes as a U.S. citizen, but I cannot have a voice to represent what I feel is right within my own community. It’s frustrating,” he told me. “I was born with a Social Security number, I’ve got a U.S. passport.”
In Anchorage, I met an American Samoan woman named Maddy Unutoa, who runs an advocacy group to advance civil rights for Samoans living in Alaska. Like Pese, Unutoa told me she never thought about American Samoa’s place in the U.S. empire until she left home.
“The feeling there is pride—proud of being American,” she said. “I grew up being told we were always more powerful than the independent state of Samoa, because of currency, and being protected by the most powerful military ever. That was the safety net, that’s the mindset everywhere you go in American Samoa.
“I do not remember ever being taught that I have second-class citizenship,” she continued. “I learned all of that moving back here.”
The question of American Samoan suffrage remains a matter of significant debate, both informal and legal. It most recently gained steam in 2021, when the U.S. District Court in Utah ruled in favor of three American Samoans living in the state, who’d argued that they should be entitled to citizenship under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. That amendment states that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.”
The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals took up the case and reversed the district court’s decision—in part, it said, out of respect for the wishes of American Samoa’s own government. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case, and so the ruling stood.
Now, anti-colonial lawyers see a new chance in Tupe Smith’s case. Attorneys with the national group Right to Democracy, which works to unwind the legacy of colonial rule in the U.S., initially sought to dismiss Smith’s case. Last November, after it lost that fight, the group took her case to the Alaska Court of Appeals, arguing in favor of citizenship for American Samoans under the 14th Amendment. Oral arguments in that case are set for Jan. 15. 
Politics in Whittier are usually as local as local gets, but many there have lately gotten up to speed on and are now backing the 14th Amendment argument. Blair, who’d been re-elected as mayor in that 2022 election, introduced a resolution last year decrying “discrimination” against American Samoans and urging that Alaska amend its constitution to grant state and local voting rights to American Samoan nationals. One longtime white resident and reindeer owner painted a sign outside her gift shop at the waterfront: “American Samoans are Americans / 14th Amendment,” it reads.

“This shouldn’t be an option under the 14th Amendment,” Blair told me. “It’s the typical colonization B.S.
“One of the most valuable things you can ever have is citizenship,” he said. “To say, ‘Welcome to the United States—where you’ve already been living!—you have no voice,’ is pretty sad.” Blair’s resolution passed the city council last spring by a vote of 6-1. 
V.
There’s something else nagging at Blair and other Whittier residents I met: They want to know how the state troopers came to target Whittier in the first place. 
Austin McDaniel, a spokesperson for the Division of Alaska State Troopers, told me his office doesn’t seek out voter misconduct cases. It does, however, respond to citizen complaints. Deputy Attorney General John Skidmore, who supervises all criminal prosecutions in Alaska, told me his office, which is now prosecuting the 11 Samoans from Whittier, is simply doing so in response to evidence handed over by the troopers.
Court documents suggest that the original complaint came from someone in Whittier. According to these filings, the anonymous complainant claimed that they learned from one of Mike Pese’s brothers, Mark, that “he was not a U.S. Citizen but had nevertheless voted in the most recent municipal election.”
Everyone in town has a theory on who sent in the complaint. “It’s very clear,” Blair said, “that someone in our community hates somebody bad enough, and knew a phone number to call.” No one has yet admitted to the act, either publicly or in a long series of conversations I’ve been having with Whittier residents since July. Most connect the complaint to Blair’s 2022 victory. 
“Somebody decided that his margin of winning was skewed by the people who may have voted illegally,” Deputy Mayor Peter Denmark told me from the deck of his kayak-tour company at Whittier’s waterfront. “Some people think there was some skullduggery afoot.”
“There was an unwritten rule: ‘What happens in Whittier stays in Whittier,’” he added, pulling from a Marlboro Red. The anonymous complaint changed that.

When I interviewed Skidmore, the deputy attorney general, I mentioned how the criminal cases looked from the family’s perspective: They insist that they did not know they were breaking the law, and that government officials, including people who handle voter registration and the troopers who conducted the investigation, were clearly just as confused as they were about the voting rights of American Samoans. I asked Skidmore why the state is still pursuing charges.
“Ignorance of the law is not a defense,” Skidmore replied.
I asked him if this situation might be better resolved through public education, and with improved training for the state officials whose own confusion about voter eligibility had helped create this mess. There is some precedent, after all, for a non-punitive fix to this exact problem: Nobody was prosecuted when Oregon last year discovered it had registered hundreds of non-citizens, nor when an American Samoan national ran for the Hawaii state House as a Republican in 2018, not realizing she was ineligible.
But Skidmore made clear that the state does not regard this as a matter of harmless confusion. “We have to establish, in order to charge a crime, that someone knew that they were in fact not a U.S. citizen, that they were not eligible to vote as a result.” He would not comment on specific evidence in the Whittier cases. Transcripts of the state’s presentation to grand juries in these cases—documents that would presumably elucidate the state’s precise arguments—remain sealed, as the cases are all still pending.
But this much does seem clear: The state, per Skidmore, is not moved by the family members’ insistence that they identified as citizens on registration forms because they were confused, and in some cases directly misinformed by officials who were supposed to be sources of clarity. On the contrary, he emphasized that the state is determined to prove that this family acted with criminal intent.
I asked Skidmore whether it matters to these cases that officials were themselves confused about the law; he said it does not: “The fact that law enforcement might tell someone something that’s inaccurate doesn’t impact our opinion.”
He went so far as to say his office has an “obligation” to prosecute this case, in order to demonstrate to the public “that our elections are held in a way that the citizens can trust.”
“Otherwise,” Skidmore said, “we end up with violence, and that’s the worst thing for us all in a democracy. I think when people don’t trust elections, when they don’t trust what’s going on, then they have a tendency to lash out.” 
VI.
On a Friday evening last spring, a couple of weeks after the group of Whittier Samoans received their summonses in the mail, one of the accused family members, Mike’s 65-year-old mother, Mili, collapsed from a stroke while leading a youth service in the chapel in the basement of the town’s apartment complex. 
Mili, the matriarch of the local Samoan community, was one of the first Samoans to lay down roots in Whittier. She owns Kozy Korner, the food market inside the apartment complex, where she sells non-perishables, kitchen staples, and even a few comforts from home, like coconut milk. She lets the kids raid the ice cream cooler and organizes local events, including an annual July 4 cookout.
Pese began to cry as we discussed his mother’s health. “She doesn’t want to feel stressed, she’s always smiling and doesn’t want us to worry,” he said. “But that day during the youth service when she gave her sermon and had her stroke, that’s when I knew she’d been hiding her stress. She doesn’t want us to see it.”
Mili’s condition had worsened by the time I got to Whittier this past summer, months after her stroke. Additional testing had revealed a lump in her leg that had metastasized into Stage 4 of a rare and aggressive cancer. She spent the summer in Seattle getting treatment and was scheduled for a major surgery in October.

Over a video call in August, Mili told me she never meant to break the law. “I did not know,” she said. “It stresses me out, it stresses me a lot, going through with my treatments and everything. I try to be happy and forget everything until my treatment is all done.
“It’s really sad. It’s so sad, when I think about it. I love Whittier. The first time I arrived there, I was really happy. It’s really safe for my family, my kids. That’s why I spend all my time helping the community. All these things happening, it’s kind of changed my mind. My kids ask me why we don’t leave Whittier. But I think we need to stay, we need to fight for what’s right for us.”
Smith had wanted to join her mother-in-law in Seattle before the surgery as her round-the-clock caretaker, but ultimately she and Pese decided to stay home to keep earning money in case they end up owing court fines. Smith, who works as a toll collector at the Whittier tunnel, is especially worried about money now that she might have a conviction on her record, which could affect future employment prospects. She worries she won’t get promoted ever again because of the charges, and her childhood dream of becoming a teacher now seems more distant than ever.
“I feel like it’s too much sometimes, when I’m alone,” Smith told me. “I usually run down to the store to talk to my mother-in-law to try to distract each other from what’s going on. I don’t get to have that anymore because she’s away.”
On nights when Pese is away at work, as the kids sleep, Smith finds herself desperate for distraction. “There are times when I sit in a room, and it’s so quiet,” she says. She cleans to stay busy. 
More than once, after midnight, she’s found herself scrubbing down an area of the house only to realize she’d already just cleaned it.

Late last summer, the state offered plea deals to all of the defendants except Tupe Smith. This would have allowed them to avoid incarceration; some were offered deals promising to clear their records if they went a year without another offense. 
On a Sunday morning in August, while these offers were still fresh, Tafi Toleafoa, director of Pacific Community of Alaska, visited Whittier and joined the Samoan community in the church in the basement of the apartment tower. Samoan families sat on one side of the room, and on the other side were some of their white neighbors. One of the defendants, Nelson Vaimoa, led the service, and others charged with illegal voting, including Smith, sang in the choir.
Toleafoa addressed the congregants, as piano music played and young children squirmed in the back of the room. She asked the defendants not to accept any plea deals, telling them she was worried about the precedent that might be set: If the state could claim any measure of victory in the Whittier prosecutions, how would that affect the many non-citizen nationals living elsewhere in Alaska? Might they be prosecuted on the same grounds? 
“I ask for perseverance,” Toleafoa told the room. “Because the justice system takes a very long time and sometimes it’s not even justice, right? You don’t find justice in our justice system. 
“You make the decision that is right for you, but know that the impact of this case will be very vital for our community here in Alaska.”
Soon after, Mili spoke on a video call from Seattle, where she was awaiting her big surgery in October. Smith held a phone up to a mic: “I don’t fear anything,” Mili told the congregation. She began to cry and then almost wail, as slow, moody piano music played in the background. “We have to stand proud,” she said. “We have to stand firm, not just fade away.” 
She went on: “I miss everyone. I just want to come home. … Everyday, I pray for God’s healing.” The choir started up again as she wrapped her remarks, so that for 30 seconds or so her sobs were layered over their song.

All this seemed to be enough to convince any family members tempted by a plea deal not to go through with it. 
Earlier in the week, Mike Pese had told me he was inclined to accept the offer, just to get it all over with. He’s the type to plan for the worst, he said, and pleading guilty would at least guarantee that he and Smith wouldn’t be incarcerated at the same time, both away from their children. But after the service, he said, “If the state is using us as a starting point to start prosecuting all these U.S. nationals all over the state, then taking the deal is not a viable option for us.”
I asked Taleafoa to tell me more about American Samoans in Alaska who are potentially vulnerable to future prosecutions for voting, or at least registering to vote, without knowing they’d done anything wrong. “It’s not potential,” she said. “There are thousands of people.”

VII.
The State Troopers insist they weren’t searching for voting crimes in Whittier. “We didn’t go out looking for this; we received a complaint,” McDaniel, the spokesperson, told me. “We don’t go through and cull voter rolls and check in this or that database to see if someone’s a resident or a citizen. We don’t do that.”
There is plenty of evidence, though, that Republican officials in Alaska—and across the country more broadly—are very much looking for a fight over non-citizen voting, to make it appear widespread and to further the false claim that the nation’s elections are rife with fraud. In the Whittier case, they may have found their best opportunity yet. 
The state Division of Elections has happily complied with the Trump administration’s hunt for illegal voting by non-citizens, handing over its voter rolls to the U.S. Department of Justice when asked in 2025. 
But illegal voting by non-citizens is exceedingly rare, both in Alaska and across the country. According to the state attorney general’s office, only seven people had even been charged with any form of voter misconduct in Alaska in the last decade, meaning that the Whittier defendants alone make up the majority of the state’s voter fraud cases in the Trump era. Only four people in that period were convicted, and none of them for offenses having anything to do with non-citizen voting. 
In Anchorage I met with Andrew Gray, a Democratic state representative who chairs the House Judiciary Committee. Last year he convened a special legislative hearing to discuss the Whittier cases. “I absolutely think that the reason there was a raid [in Whittier] and why we’re pursuing these prosecutions is because it gives some ammunition to the folks who want to say that our election system is not safe, and that non-citizens vote,” he told me.
Alaska’s next legislative session opens this month, and Gray argued that lawmakers should respond to the Whittier prosecutions by referring to the ballot a constitutional amendment to grant state and local voting rights to non-citizen nationals.
The Alaska legislature is run by an unusual coalition of Democrats and Republican lawmakers who’ve broken from their party, while the governor is a conservative, Trump-friendly Republican. Gray finds it unlikely the constitutional amendment would succeed in this context. “There is simply no way that I can market anything to expand privileges to American nationals. The way that will be perceived by folks on the right is that we’re trying to make Alaska a sanctuary state,” he said. “I can hear that already.”
He went on, mulling his feelings aloud: “Is there value in filing to raise the issue? To use it as a talking point? I don’t know. This is the right thing to do, so maybe we have the discussion about it.”
Meanwhile, prominent Alaska conservatives are forging ahead with their own ballot proposal, to ban non-citizen voting in the state. It’s already forbidden in Alaska—and everywhere else in the country, save for the handful of towns and cities that allow non-citizen voting in certain local elections—and the new ballot measure would do little except emphasize current law: someone “may” vote in Alaska if they are a U.S. citizen above 18 years old who has lived in the state at least 30 days prior to an election; the ballot measure would change the law to say that “only” people meeting those qualifications may vote in Alaska. The measure will appear on the 2026 ballot, if organizers get enough signatures to qualify.
Coghill, the Republican former majority leader of the Alaska House and Senate, is now co-chairing the amendment campaign. He told me he’s seen that several cities around the country allow local voting by non-citizens, and that he wants to make sure that never happens in Alaska. He told me the measure isn’t a response to the Whittier case. 
There is a special irony to the ballot measure and the Whittier case: Alaska was itself a U.S. territory, with limited voting rights and political representation, until 1959, and many Alaskans, led by Native and women activists in particular, fought for their democratic inclusion prior to statehood. What’s more, Tupe Smith is hardly the first person to seek a government position there under dubious qualifications: The second person to ever serve as territorial governor of Alaska, John Franklin Strong in 1913, was himself an undocumented Canadian immigrant.
VIII.
The day before the Whittier folks were formally arraigned in court in May 2025, Nelson Vaimoa, who led the church service I attended, was driving some water samples from the town to Anchorage, when he saw police lights behind him. Vaimoa, who worked for the tunnel and was driving a company truck, said he was distracted by the upcoming court date, and didn’t realize he was speeding. 
“I was only thinking about the case, because the next day is the case, is the hearing,” Vaimoa told me. He said he was fired later that day after he told his boss about the speeding ticket.
The next day, Vaimoa stood in court alongside his family members, including his wife, who was pregnant with their first child and also faced charges for non-citizen voting. Many of the defendants struggled to keep up with what was being said; the court made little effort to translate materials into Samoan, and botched some of what it did try to translate. Taleafoa couldn’t help laughing from the back of the room, she told me, when the court, attempting to translate the word “criminal,” simply made up a word for it: “criminale,” which has no meaning in Samoan.

Everything Vaimoa knew about the justice system to that point had come from television and movies. “My hands never sweat that much before,” he said of that first court appearance. “This was a whole different experience—terrifying.”
He was despondent in our interview a few months later in August, far from the joyful leader I’d seen during the church service an hour prior. “I have no job. I need to stay up with paying my car, my insurance,” he said.
Vaimoa told me that when he voted locally, he felt proud—a real part of his community. He’d seen so many ads encouraging Alaskans to vote, and the state had certainly cleared the path for him to do so by sending him a voter registration card. “I was so happy that I had to exercise my right to vote,” he said. He had the card handy in his wallet and showed it to me.
Now, he added, “Whenever I see someone I just put my head down and don’t say anything because of this whole case. I just don’t want to make any more mistakes.” The birth of his daughter last year has changed his perspective, he said, instilling a new sense of responsibility: “I’m at a point where it’s better to be silent, not to share my thoughts to anyone. … I have trouble trusting people now.”
After Vaimoa and the other defendants rejected the plea deals they were offered, the state secured grand jury indictments against each of them. It’s unclear where their cases go from here; no trials have yet been scheduled. Each of them—including Mili, who is now back in Whittier but who remains in fragile health—faces potentially lengthy prison time if convicted. So does Smith.
As a result of all this, some Samoans are contemplating leaving Whittier altogether. “I poured everything into Whittier,” Pese told me. “I don’t know what I would do if my mom was no longer here with me, but she’s the only reason I’m still here.”
Some longtime residents told me that this type of reaction is fairly common here: Whittier is too small, they said, to live for too long under the shadow of any public scandal. A lot of people end up simply vanishing, they said. They rarely come back. 
Meanwhile, Whittier’s evolution marches on: In July, the town administration debuted a grand plan for the future of business activity in the town. The opening of the new cruise terminal here means annual cruise-ship visits are poised to jump from 46 to 72. The town may concurrently look to increase municipal fees on Whittier businesses in order to boost the local government’s revenue and attract a higher class of operator to the shore. The town development plan also includes a new RV campground and a new walking and biking corridor stretching from one end of town to the other. 
Dan Blair isn’t sold on the plan. “The only thing that’s changed is that now we have more potential for money, and a lot more people trying to take it from us,” he told me. On Oct. 5, he stood for re-election, facing off against Lori Borg, the wife of the town’s harbormaster, who is more popular among newer Whittier voters who tend to favor the development plan. Borg declined my interview request.

It was an important local election, the kind in which the Samoan community in Whittier would have been eager to participate, back when they thought they could vote. Mike Pese had himself once dreamed of running for a seat on the council here, before Tupe Smith was arrested. He’s abandoned that dream, of course, and started to withdraw from public life in Whittier—even by pulling the couple’s son, Max, out of school. He and Smith now homeschool him inside their apartment. 
Pese now and then runs into school teachers around town. “Sometimes they approach me; they say, ‘Hey, we miss Max!’ But after everything…” he trailed off wistfully.
Election Day came and went in Whittier, but this time Blair, who’d won by 13 votes three years ago, could not count on the support of the local Samoans. Beyond the 11 facing criminal charges, several other Samoans in the community who are citizens, and thus eligible to vote, decided to sit this one out. “They’re all too traumatized after the troopers came,” Smith told me. 
Blair lost by 14 votes.

Kennedy, Jr.","MASSACHUSETTS OFFICIALS OFFERED their own childhood immunization recommendations on Wednesday that depart from recently announced federal vaccine guidelines. 
The state is continuing to recommend the pediatric vaccination schedule that’s been endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics. The move deviates from changes in vaccine recommendations issued by the Centers for Disease Control under the direction of the Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.
“No matter what happens in Washington, in Massachusetts we make public health decisions based on evidence and what will best protect our children and families,” said Gov. Maura Healey. “Secretary Kennedy’s rollback of long-standing federal vaccine recommendations creates confusion for parents and providers and erodes trust. Our message to families is simple: we will continue to stand behind science and preserve access to the vaccines children need to stay healthy.” 
On January 5, HHS reduced the number of vaccines recommended for US children from 17 to 11. The move followed a directive from President Donald Trump, which ordered the agency to “review international best practices from peer, developed countries,” according to HHS. Federal officials have said the change would not affect health insurance coverage of vaccines.
“President Trump directed us to examine how other developed nations protect their children and to take action if they are doing better,” Kennedy said on January 5. “After an exhaustive review of the evidence, we are aligning the US childhood vaccine schedule with international consensus while strengthening transparency and informed consent. This decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health.”
The CDC’s list of recommended vaccines for all children includes: measles, mumps, rubella, polio, pertussis, tenants, diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae type B, pneumococcal disease, human papillomarivus or HPV and varicella also know as chicken pox. It’s up to parents and doctors to decide whether children should receive COVID-19, influenza and rotavirus vaccines. Another category outlines recommendations for children depending on risk factors and includes vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus or RSV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, dengue, and meningococcal ACWY and meningococcal B.
A 2025 state law grants the Massachusetts Department of Public Health the authority to set independent vaccine standards, regardless of federal recommendations.
DPH has issued guidance to health care providers and community stakeholders across the state recommending that clinicians use the American Academy of Pediatrics schedule for pediatric vaccination.
The academy’s schedule includes vaccines for: COVID-19; dengue; diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis; haemophilus influenzae type b; hepatitis A and B; human papillomarivus; multiple kinds of flu shots; measles, mumps and rubella; meningococcal ACWY, ABCWY and B; Mpox; pneumococcal conjugate; pneumococcal polysaccharide; polio; RSV; rotavirus; and varicella.
The state’s recommendation also aligns with the Northeast Public Health Collaborative, which was formed last year in response to shifting federal public health changes.
“The science is clear,” said DPH Commissioner Robbie Goldstein. “Vaccines remain one of the most effective tools we have to prevent serious illness and save lives.

(Utah Department of Commerce)When one illicit massage business is shut down in Utah, police and state regulators say another opens nearby. 
And when they suspect prostitution and human trafficking may be happening behind storefronts with neon signs, they told reporters on Wednesday, they often get nowhere because workers won’t talk to them and owners disappear. 
Their shared frustrations are the basis for a new state law they say will help them hold bad actors accountable. 
“This is your warning. Get out of town. Get out of our state,” Margaret Busse, executive director of the Utah Department of Commerce, said at a news conference in Salt Lake City. She said the illegal operations detract from the hard work and professionalism of massage businesses offering legal, safe therapy. 
The 2025 law removes a “glaring administrative loophole” that allowed state licensors to punish only the workers and not the business owners, Busse said. “We are now able to shift our site from the exploited to the exploiters.”

The new law requires massage businesses to register with the agency this year, mandates background checks and finger printing for owners and general managers, and gives the state authority to carry out inspections. 
“And in fact, it’s unlawful conduct to resist, to lock the door, to keep the inspectors from entering the premises to ensure compliance with the law,” said Mark Steinagel, director of the Utah 
Division of Professional Licensing. He said Utah gives inspectors similar power to see pharmacy records and contractor job sites. 
The law took effect in October, and the Commerce Department plans to make its registration form available to companies sometime in spring. 
The division has long regulated individual massage therapists by requiring them to be licensed, but not the businesses and owners. If those owners don’t register in compliance with the new law, the state can inform city governments, which can then revoke their business licenses. 
Illicit massage businesses are a growing problem in Utah, law enforcement tells legislators

Salt Lake City Police Chief Brian Redd said of nearly 200 suspected illicit massage businesses in Utah, 61 are in Salt Lake City. 
“It’s very hard to shut these businesses down,” Redd said. “It’s hard to get to the bottom of who the business owners actually are.” He said the new licensing system will help provide police with critical information in future cases. 
The measure passed last year after an earlier version faced pushback from the American Massage Therapy Association, which said it would have weakened oversight, rather than strengthen it. 
Roger Olbrot, a licensed massage therapist in Sugar House and a past president of the association, said the new law will help him and others separate themselves further from businesses they don’t want to be associated with. 
“The people that I have talked to have been very excited about the fact that we can now segregate ourselves, good versus bad,” Olbrot told Utah News Dispatch. “I’ve been in the business now 27 years, and even today, I get solicitations for illicit practice.” 
While some other states already have similar laws requiring businesses to register with the state, “they lack teeth because of resources,” said Jeff Shumway with Utah’s Office of Professional Licensure Review. 
In Colorado, Aurora passed an ordinance to the same effect, raising requirements to obtain a massage business license and making it easier to revoke.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-15 01:19:16+00:00,CT Mirror,Report: Problems persist in CT special ed system despite federal compliance,Theo Peck-Suzuki,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/14/report-problems-persist-in-ct-special-ed-system-despite-federal-compliance/,The report was commissioned amid concerns CT wasn't doing enough to support students with disabilities. Its findings affirmed those concerns.,"Flaws in Connecticut’s special education system are impeding the state’s ability to provide adequate services to students, according to a report released Wednesday by state Education Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker.
Russell-Tucker commissioned the report six months ago amid concerns the state wasn’t doing enough to support students with disabilities. The findings affirmed many of those worries, revealing a system struggling with staffing shortages, arduous data collection software and a widespread lack of confidence in how disputes are resolved. As a result, children may struggle to access the resources they require for a free adequate public education — a legal standard also known as FAPE.
“We didn’t do this because we thought we were going to get a … report that says, ‘You’re doing everything well,'” Russell-Tucker told the State Board of Education at its meeting Wednesday. “That was not the point. 
“We did this because it was a need — to make sure that we understand and uncover where the challenges are, so we can literally be having this conversation today, very clearly and concisely, about what it is our next steps need to be,” Russell-Tucker said.
Representatives of WestEd, a consulting group, conducted the evaluation and presented the findings alongside Russell-Tucker at Wednesday’s meeting. 
Several individuals also shared views on the report during a public comment period at the meeting.
Andrew Feinstein, an attorney who represents children with disabilities and a founding member of the group Special Education Equity for Kids in Connecticut, called the report “devastating.”
“The fundamental problem appears to be that the Bureau of Special Education sees itself primarily as a conduit to transmit district-generated data to the federal Department of Education. It does not see itself as accountable to parents and teachers. The bureau is ineffective in improving results for students,” Feinstein told the board.
Kathryn Meyer, an attorney with the Center for Child Advocacy who works with low-income families, agreed. “Right now too many of our clients are sending their children with disabilities to school — our most vulnerable students — worried not just about the quality of their education, but their child’s safety and supervision. We are seeing district by district unable to provide adequate staffing support to meet their basic needs, and our children are paying the price,” Meyer wrote in an email to the Connecticut Mirror.
There was a bright spot: The report found Connecticut does routinely meet federal targets regarding special education.
The problem, Feinstein told CT Mirror, is that the state itself sets those targets. If the state sets and meets a low target, the federal government won’t see a problem, he said— even if a large number of kids still aren’t receiving adequate support.
That blind spot is what Russell-Tucker said she’d sought to clarify by commissioning the report. 
Rorie Fitzpatrick of WestEd, the consultancy that produced the report, praised the commissioner for taking a proactive approach to improving Connecticut’s approach to special education. “This was not a compelled endeavor. The compulsion here was a commitment to results for students,” Fitzpatrick told the board.
The report included four categories of recommendations to the state Department of Education. 
That included better defining the state’s “vision” for students with disabilities to ensure everyone in the system understands the goals and mission; mapping out and streamlining how staff and workflows are organized; coordinating more effectively within the department to address staffing shortages; and strengthening legal oversight and transparency in how the state handles disputes between parents and teachers.
That last category is especially important to families that feel schools are not adequately assisting children with disabilities, whether due to a staff shortage, an improper IEP or another issue.
Right now, Feinstein said, the most accessible option for low-income parents is the state’s administrative complaint process. The process is free, but it suffers from extended delays, and the results can be legally suspect, he said. As a result, Feinstein said, he seldom relies on state complaints.
Meyer told CT Mirror her organization has also experienced issues with the state complaint process.
“We have experiences with cases where … corrective action has not been fully monitored or enforced, and that’s something that we continue to urge [the state Department of Education] to really take a look at,” Meyer said. “Corrective action is not meaningful if a district doesn’t think it’s going to be required in a timely manner.”
Meyer also said she thought the report’s data on the number of complaints filed in the state seemed low. “That was surprising and doesn’t align with my experience,” she said.
In the report, WestEd recommended that the state hire a legal expert to support investigators and analyze their findings, with the aim of ensuring legal integrity and determining appropriate corrective actions. 
Meyer said that seems like a step in the right direction. “A lot of investigators have a lot of experience and want to do well by these families, but having someone with a legal lens to support them in that process, I think, is really critical,” she said.
Families who can afford to hire a lawyer can also set in motion what is known as due process. If they cannot reach an agreement with a school district, the case will eventually come before an impartial arbiter known as a hearing officer. 
These officers are similar to court magistrates, in that they are expected to render a finding that resolves the dispute. However, the report found widespread mistrust in the quality of Connecticut’s hearing officers, with doubts about how knowledgeable they are in federal and state law. 
By way of a solution, the report recommends that Connecticut establish clear criteria for hearing officer competence and make those criteria transparent to the public to rebuild trust. It also recommends providing guidance to parents without legal representation to help them navigate the process.
Feinstein urged the board to read the report’s findings and “demand that the department [of education] make fundamental change, both in the structure and operations of the Bureau of Special Education and, more importantly, by making clear that the mission is not to passively collect data, but to enhance the education of students with disabilities.”
Meyer concurred. “At its most fundamental level, SDE needs to prioritize the voices of parents, students, and educators by following through on WestEd’s recommendations, particularly around monitoring and enforcement of children’s legal rights to a meaningful and safe education,” she wrote in an email. “Urgent action and accountability are needed.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025_0319_SR_Hearing_315-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-14 20:57:47.621898
,DC,2026-01-15 01:05:19+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Court considers end to legal protection for nearly 1 million immigrants from Haiti, Venezuela",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/court-considers-end-legal-protection-nearly-1-million-immigrants-haiti-venezuela,,"WASHINGTON — A panel of appellate judges Wednesday heard a challenge from civil rights groups to the Trump administration’s decision to revoke an extension, as well as end, temporary protections for nearly 1 million immigrants from Haiti and Venezuela. The challenge comes from the National TPS Alliance, which represents immigrants with Temporary Protected Status because their home country is deemed too dangerous to return to due to violence, war, natural disasters or other instability. The hearing came two weeks after the U.S. military actions in Venezuela, where the country's president and his wife were captured and brought to New York City to face an indictment. Despite the upheaval in the Venezuelan government from the U.S. operation, the Trump administration has continued to move forward with stripping TPS for more than 600,000 Venezuelans. Before Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem vacated extended protections put in place by the Biden administration, TPS for Venezuelans was set to expire in October. TPS for roughly 330,000 nationals from Haiti is set to expire Feb. 3, which the panel of judges acknowledged could make the issue of TPS for Haiti moot.Ahilan T. Arulanantham, from the UCLA Center for Immigration Law, who is representing the National TPS Alliance, said there are members in all 50 states who are experiencing harm as a result of their TPS being terminated by the Trump administration.He said some of those harms include “people separated from their infant children, families deported, people detained, lots of people detained.”The panel of judges from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in Wednesday’s oral arguments are Kim McLane Wardlaw, Salvador Mendoza, Jr. and Anthony D. Johnstone. Former President Bill Clinton nominated Wardlaw and former President Joe Biden nominated Mendoza and Johnstone.DOJ says Supreme Court in agreementDepartment of Justice attorney Sarah Welch said because the Supreme Court has twice granted the Trump administration’s request to move forward with TPS termination for Venezuelans, the high court must have determined the Trump administration was likely to prevail in court. A lower court in December found that Noem’s decision to vacate protections for Venezuelans and end their TPS destination was unlawful.  Wardlaw questioned how the Supreme Court’s decision, which was made on an emergency basis and gave no reasoning, impacted the case before the panel.Welch said the Supreme Court “must have concluded that we were likely to succeed on the merits of that claim, whether or not it provided reasoning published in an opinion.”Arulanantham said the Supreme Court’s orders regarding TPS for Venezuelans are “not precedent because the Supreme Court does not treat them as precedent."" He added that in the past, the Supreme Court has reversed its initial rulings, especially those made on an emergency basis. He also pushed back against Welch’s argument that Noem had the statutory authority to vacate an extension granted under TPS for Venezuelans. “The statute says once you have made an extension, it lasts for the time prior that’s given in the Federal Register notice,” Arulanantham said, referring to the TPS statute.He added that the authority to vacate a TPS extension that Noem claimed is “nowhere written in the statute.”",,,,2026-01-14 20:57:47.621898

Glenn Youngkin looks into the gallery of the House of Delegates before delivering his final State of the Commonwealth speech on Jan. 14, 2026. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury) In his final State of the Commonwealth address Wednesday evening, outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin offered a sweeping defense of his four-year tenure, arguing that Virginia is stronger economically, fiscally and educationally than when he took office in January 2022, as he prepares to hand power to Abigail Spanberger, who will be sworn in as the state’s 75th governor this weekend.
Speaking before a joint session of the General Assembly, Youngkin framed his farewell address as both a victory lap and a warning — praising bipartisan cooperation where it occurred, but urging lawmakers not to undo core policies he credits for economic growth, particularly right-to-work laws, tax cuts and his administration’s approach to energy and education.
“This is the state of the commonwealth that I have had the immense honor of serving these past four years,” Youngkin said, thanking lawmakers and Virginians as he prepares to leave office. “By every single metric, today Virginia is stronger than she has ever been.”
Youngkin, a Republican elected in 2021, entered office amid the COVID-19 pandemic’s aftermath, school closures, rising violent crime and economic uncertainty. 
He repeatedly contrasted those conditions with what he described as a “Great Virginia Renaissance,” asserting that his administration reversed population loss, restored job growth and stabilized state finances.
Among his central claims was that Virginia has attracted more than $157 billion in business investment during his term, which he said exceeds the combined total of the previous six administrations. 
He pointed to major projects involving companies such as LEGO, Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca and Hitachi, along with recent manufacturing announcements in Southside and the Piedmont.
Virginia, he said, is “a winning state,” with nearly 270,000 more people working now than when he took office and tens of thousands of additional jobs in the pipeline.
Those investments, Youngkin argued, are directly tied to policies that future lawmakers should preserve, including Virginia’s right-to-work law, which prohibits mandatory union membership. 
“Change Right to Work and jobs will disappear,” he warned. “No amendments. No reforms. No changes.”
Youngkin also emphasized record state revenues, citing more than $10 billion in budget surpluses over four years and roughly $9 billion in tax relief enacted during his administration. 
He said December revenue numbers showed continued growth, allowing for additional tax cuts alongside expanded funding for education, Medicaid, public safety and capital projects.
Those budget decisions have been a point of contention for Democrats, who argue that repeated rounds of tax cuts risk limiting long-term investments and question whether recent revenue surpluses are sustainable.
Education was another cornerstone of Youngkin’s address, particularly his administration’s response to pandemic-era learning loss. He cited Virginia’s ranking near the bottom nationally in reopening schools when he took office and claimed the state has since led the nation in math recovery and reductions in chronic absenteeism.
“We were 46th in the nation to reopen our schools,” Youngkin said. “The learning loss was devastating.”
He credited bipartisan legislation, including the Virginia Literacy Act and investments in tutoring, lab schools and career and technical education, for improved outcomes. 
According to Youngkin, four out of five Virginia high school students now graduate with a credential or certificate, and teacher pay has increased nearly 20%, contributing to a sharp drop in vacancies.
Those reforms have also drawn scrutiny, with ongoing disputes over testing standards, lab school governance and parental rights policies championed by Youngkin, including restrictions on school mask mandates and curriculum content.
Public safety and behavioral health featured prominently as well. 
Youngkin said violent crime, including murders, has declined roughly 30% statewide during his term, crediting law enforcement funding, anti-gang initiatives and fentanyl enforcement. He highlighted a 59% reduction in fatal fentanyl overdoses, attributing the drop to tougher penalties, public awareness campaigns and expanded access to naloxone.
On behavioral health, Youngkin touted what he called a complete system overhaul, citing major expansions in crisis beds, mobile crisis teams and the 988 hotline. The administration’s “Right Help, Right Now” initiative has drawn bipartisan praise but also questions about workforce shortages and long-term funding. 
Energy policy marked one of the sharpest contrasts with Democrats and the incoming administration. 
Youngkin reiterated his opposition to rejoining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and urged lawmakers to repeal the Virginia Clean Economy Act, arguing that renewable energy mandates alone cannot meet Virginia’s growing demand, particularly from data centers.
“We need to double our generating capacity in the next 10 years. Renewables alone, which will drive up costs and risk brownouts, just can’t get it done,” he said, calling for expanded natural gas and nuclear power.
Democrats have countered that abandoning clean energy targets would undermine climate goals and increase long-term costs, a debate likely to intensify under Spanberger’s administration. 
Youngkin closed his address with a reflection on Virginia’s role in the nation’s upcoming 250th anniversary, linking his administration’s emphasis on “commonsense” governance to the state’s founding legacy.
“It has been the honor of a lifetime for Suzanne and me to serve,” he said. “We have strengthened the spirit of Virginia — together.”

Todd Young of Indiana and Josh Hawley of Missouri flipped on their previous votes to advance the resolution, splitting support at 50-50 — and delivering a victory to Trump, who had strongly criticized Republican senators who earlier defected from the administration.Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky voted to keep the effort alive in the Senate. Paul is the only Republican co-sponsor of the bill. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia was the leading Democratic co-sponsor.Young said while he “strongly” believes Congress must be involved in any decisions about the commitment of U.S. troops, administration officials assured him that is not the state of play in Venezuela.“After numerous conversations with senior national security officials, I have received assurances that there are no American troops in Venezuela. I’ve also received a commitment that if President Trump were to determine American forces are needed in major military operations in Venezuela, the Administration will come to Congress in advance to ask for an authorization of force,” Young said in a written statement after he cast his vote.Rare rebuke doesn’t lastThe vote came less than a week after Young and Hawley were among the  five Senate Republicans who broke with party ranks to move the resolution across an initial procedural hurdle — a rare rebuke of Trump from some in his own party.Trump pointedly attacked the five GOP senators after they voted, writing on his Truth Social platform that the lawmakers “should never be elected to office again.” Senate Republicans argued a resolution to rein in Trump’s military actions against Venezuela is not relevant because “there’s no troops there, there is nothing to terminate,” as Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Jim Risch said on the floor ahead of the vote.“Now, I know some of my colleagues will argue that a vote for this resolution is a prospective statement about limiting future action in Venezuela. That's not what it says. They argue, ‘we still have ships in the Caribbean, and clearly the president is ready to invade again,’ they say. But again, that is not what the resolution says. … No language in this resolution addresses future action,” said Risch, R-Idaho, who moved to table the measure.The vote came 11 days after U.S. special forces apprehended Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, from their bedroom during a surprise overnight raid. The couple was wanted by U.S. authorities on federal drug and conspiracy charges.The vote also comes after a monthslong bombing campaign on small boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean in which U.S. strikes killed more than 115 alleged “narco-terrorists,” according to U.S. Southern Command.Within an hour before senators voted to block any advancement of the war powers resolution, Trump posted on social media that he “had a very good call” Thursday morning with Venezuela’s interim President Delcy Rodríguez.“We are making tremendous progress, as we help Venezuela stabilize and recover. Many topics were discussed, including Oil, Minerals, Trade and, of course, National Security. This partnership between the United States of America and Venezuela will be a spectacular one FOR ALL. Venezuela will soon be great and prosperous again, perhaps more so than ever before!” Trump wrote on his own platform, Truth Social.Trump hosted oil executives at the White House Friday for a meeting on potential investment in Venezuela’s oil industry. Prior to the meeting, the president announced the South American nation had already agreed to give the U.S. between 30 million and 50 million barrels of oil. Trump said he would control the money made from the sale.‘We are heavily engaged’Paul and Democratic sponsors of the war powers resolution vehemently disagreed with the GOP statements about the U.S. presence in and around Venezuela.“You don’t have to be a great expert in military affairs to know that we are heavily engaged,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, ahead of the vote.“Donald Trump says we’re not engaged in hostilities? Tell that to the 16,000 U.S. service members currently deployed in the Caribbean. Tell that to our service members on the Ford carrier strike force. Look at the Marine expeditionary unit operating in the region,” Schumer said. “Donald Trump is turning the Caribbean into a dangerous powder keg — and Congress must rein him in before one mistake ignites a larger, more unstable conflict.”Kaine likened the Republicans’ procedural move to “a parliamentary gag rule on discussion of this military operation.”“If this cause and if this legal basis were so righteous and so lawful, the administration and its supporters would not be so afraid to have this debate before the public and the United States Senate,” Kaine said on the floor ahead of the vote.Paul said the administration’s claim that Venezuela is not an official war is “an absurdity.”“The invasion of another country, blockading of a country and removing another country's leader, to my mind, clearly, is war,” Paul said on the floor ahead of the vote.U.S. Southern Command declined to confirm Wednesday the exact number of troops and warships present in the region.Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said more than 100 were killed in the raid, according to numerous media outlets that posted a video of his statement. The Cuban government announced on Facebook 32 of its citizens were among the dead.Seven U.S. troops were injured in the incursion, according to the Pentagon. Five returned to work within days after the attack, while two were still recovering as of Jan. 8.

Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha. March 26, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen is seeking a criminal investigation into State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha over removing and later returning part of a Nebraska Capitol display on American history from conservative nonprofit PragerU.

The governor released a statement Wednesday afternoon saying he and his team have “carefully consulted with law enforcement and members of the Legislature” and “concluded this warrants a criminal investigation by law enforcement.” Pillen says he told the Nebraska State Patrol to refer the materials from the incident to the Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office.
On the first day of this year’s legislative session, Cavanaugh, a progressive lawmaker in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, removed the frames because she said, “We are not allowed to adhere anything to the walls in the hallway of the Capitol.”
She said that, typically, any such display would be placed near the information desk, not on the walls along the Capitol’s hallways.
Cavanaugh said she tried not to damage the artwork and called the State Patrol to let them know where to find the paintings. The patrol returned the posters to the Nebraska Capitol Commission, which Speaker John Arch said had approved the display’s use of the walls. The images were rehung later that day.

Since then, the incident has been amplified by conservative influencers and media outlets after Pillen, a Republican, tweeted security footage of the incident and wrote that he was “disappointed in this shameful and selfish bad example.” 
No “apparent damage” was done to the art, a State Patrol spokesman said last week. He also said at the time that there was no active investigation of the incident. Cavanaugh apologized last week as State Sen. Jared Storm of David City asked the Legislature’s Executive Board to reprimand her for her actions.

State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, chair of the Legislature’s Executive Board, which handles internal issues of discipline, said the issue would be discussed during a closed portion of the meeting, but said Cavanaugh’s apologies were “sincere.” 
The Exec Board took no immediate action on Cavanaugh. 
Pillen, in his Wednesday statement, said, “Many Nebraskans and officials in the Capitol have expressed, if a private citizen had engaged in similar conduct, there would be a consequence for such misconduct.”
The nonprofit behind the images has faced criticism for sharing content that historians consider misleading and inaccurate. The latest display is part of a push from the Trump administration’s White House Task Force 250, outreach designed to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the U.S. President Donald Trump has endorsed Pillen’s 2026 reelection bid.
During a legislative session, Nebraska lawmakers can only be cited, not arrested, based on a provision of the state constitution meant to prevent outside interference in the Legislature’s actions.
Cavanaugh had no immediate comment. 
Lancaster County Sheriff Terry Wagner did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

The question for Vermonters is not whether inclusion matters, but how we will sustain it 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Brian Bloomfield: Equity means giving the shorter kid a stool.","This commentary is by Brian Bloomfield, Ph.D., head of school at Lyndon Institute and chair of the Council of Independent Schools for Vermont.



In my first year of teaching, a mentor pulled me aside to talk about equity. I was struggling to connect with a few students, and she offered a simple illustration: if two students are trying to reach the top of a cabinet and one is shorter, treating them the same does not give them the same chance. Equity means giving the shorter student a stool.
Nearly 30 years later, that lesson remains central to how many educators understand their work. Education is not about producing uniform outcomes or serving an imagined average student. It is about creating the conditions in which every student can learn, grow and participate meaningfully in school and in civic life.
Today, that principle is especially important as Vermonters debate how schools serve students with disabilities and learning differences. 
One persistent misconception is that some schools—particularly approved independent schools—do not share the same responsibilities as public schools when it comes to special education. 
Vermont law is clear: under Act 173, all approved schools are obligated to enroll and support students with individualized education programs (IEPs) and to provide access to services comparable to those available elsewhere in the public education system.
Act 173 was designed to move Vermont away from a deficit-based, label-driven approach to special education and toward a system that emphasizes equity, inclusion and shared responsibility. 
The law does not lower expectations for schools: it raises them. It recognizes that students learn in different ways and that schools must organize staffing, expertise and resources accordingly.
Today, Vermont faces a growing, statewide challenge that deserves more public attention: while overall student enrollment continues to decline, the number of students requiring special education support is rising. 
Yet the supply of trained special educators, related service providers and specialists has not kept pace. This shortage is not a talking point—it is an ethical and practical problem affecting classrooms across the state.
Special educators are not interchangeable aides or add-ons. They are highly trained professionals who manage complex learning plans, collaborate with classroom teachers and ensure that legal and educational obligations are met. 
Their work improves outcomes not only for students with identified disabilities but for entire classrooms and school communities. Diluting that expertise or treating complex learning needs as minor variations in attention or motivation undermines both students and teachers.
Independent schools, public schools and supervisory unions are all navigating this reality together. At Lyndon Institute, where I serve as head of school, students with IEPs and health plans are a significant part of the student body—an experience that mirrors trends seen statewide. 
LI is one example among many Vermont schools working to meet legal obligations while responding to increasingly complex student needs. The specifics differ from school to school, but the responsibility is the same.
The broader question for Vermonters is not whether inclusion matters, but how we will sustain it. Doing this work well requires investment in professional training, realistic staffing models and policies that recognize the true scope of student needs. 
There are no shortcuts. Equity demands time, expertise and commitment—especially to the more rural communities of Vermont. 
As Vermont continues to examine its education system, we should resist narratives that pit schools against one another or suggest that inclusion is optional. 
It is not. 
Inclusion is a civic obligation grounded in law, research and basic fairness. If we believe that every student deserves a real opportunity to succeed, then our policies and our public conversations must reflect that belief.

Janet Mills said her administration could not confirm any planned federal immigration operations but said she's working with leaders of Portland and Lewiston to prepare. (Screenshot)The mayors of Maine’s two largest cities announced Wednesday that they are expecting increased federal immigration presence in their communities soon, as tensions rise across the nation following the fatal shooting by a federal officer in Minnesota. 
Gov. Janet Mills says, “Maine will not be intimidated.” 
The governor is working with the cities of Portland and Lewiston to prepare, she announced in a video Wednesday night, in which she also called for any protests to be peaceful. 
“To the federal government I say this: if your plan is to come here to be provocative and to undermine the civil rights of Maine residents, do not be confused – those tactics are not welcome here,” Mills said. 
The Mills administration hasn’t been able to confirm any planned operations, and neither mayor responded to questions about how they were notified. U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin did not confirm nor deny a forthcoming escalation in Maine.  
“Every day, DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country,” McLaughlin wrote in a statement. “We do not discuss future or potential operations.”
Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline and Portland Mayor Mark Dion urged residents and businesses to know their rights and create a plan in case they are stopped by federal authorities. 
Maine immigrant rights groups launch statewide ICE watch hotline

“I understand that this is an unsettling time for many of our residents,” Sheline wrote in a social media post. “Lewiston is a strong city and we care about our community and each other.”
After a federal immigration agent shot and killed Minneapolis resident Renee Good, protests broke out across the country, including Maine. 
Like Minnesota, both Portland and Lewiston have large immigrant populations. Androscoggin County, which includes Lewiston, has one of the nation’s most robust Somali populations, a community that has recently drawn President Donald Trump’s ire. 
The Trump administration had increased operations in Minneapolis ahead of the shooting specifically to target Somali immigrants because of alleged welfare abuse. Similar accusations are being investigated in Maine
Minnesota has been the subject of several federal investigations into fraud in its social service programs. But the Trump administration’s focus on Minneapolis comes after allegations by a right-wing YouTuber of Medicaid fraud at daycares run by Somali Americans in the city. 
Similarly, a Portland-based nonprofit that serves immigrants is facing allegations of Medicaid fraud and is currently being investigated by the state and federal government, with Republican legislators drawing direct parallels to Minnesota.
“It has nothing to do with certain populations, unless and until it does,” Minority Leader of the Maine Senate Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook) said during a press conference in late December. “I think that’s what we’re seeing, it play out in Minnesota, is that there is a strong corollary there. We should be looking at whether there’s a strong corollary here in the state of Maine.”
Trump also took further aim at Somali immigrants on Tuesday, announcing an end to humanitarian protections for that community that grant deportation relief and work permits, which had been established in 1991. 
“There is no evidence of unchecked criminal activity in our community requiring a disproportionate presence of federal agents,” Dion said of Portland. “In that view, Portland rejects the need for the deployment of ICE agents into our neighborhoods. While we respect the law, we challenge the need for a paramilitary approach to the enforcement of federal statutes.”
Sheline also wrote on social media, “As a reminder, Lewiston Police do not enforce federal law.” 
How police discretion has contributed to immigration arrests, and how that’ll change

Police are not required to and generally do not have the authority to enforce immigration laws, however local authorities have contributed to immigration arrests in Maine, including through traffic stops and following 911 calls. 
A new Maine law set to take effect later this year aims to prevent that. 
The Portland Police Department is already banned from inquiring about a person’s immigration status under city code. “We do not cooperate with ICE, nor would we ever call them to a scene,” the department’s Public Information Officer Brad Nadeau told Maine Morning Star in the fall. 
That’s not the case for the Lewiston Police Department. But when asked about their policy in the fall, the department’s public information officer Lt. Derrick St. Laurent reiterated that municipal officers can’t enforce immigration laws.
“We don’t run routine license checks through our federal partners,” he said. “However, when we encounter someone suspected of a violent offense whose identity is in question, we may request their assistance.” 
 A coalition of groups in Maine launched a hotline in October to provide real-time information about federal immigration activity and connect Maine families to resources and support services.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-14-at-7.20.57 PM-1024x509.png,,,2026-01-14 19:57:04.183954
,Mississippi Today,2026-01-15 00:18:56+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘I am terrified.’ Federal government unexpectedly cuts over $9M in grants for Mississippi mental health,Allen Siegler,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/14/federal-cuts-mississippi-mental-health/,"Emily Presley, a naloxone trainer with Communicare, demonstrates the use of naloxone and explains its life-saving potential during a training session at the Northeast Mississippi Addiction Summit in Tupelo, Miss., on Tuesday, Sept. 18, 2024.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Mississippi mental health organizations say they lost at least $9.2 million when the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration terminated grants across the country Tuesday, a loss they say could be devastating for Mississippians. 
The federal agency cut hundreds of mental health and addiction grants that are estimated to be worth roughly $2 billion, according to NPR. The news organization reported many of these grants went directly to private nonprofit organizations. 
Melody Madaris, executive director of the North Mississippi community mental health center Communicare, said the cuts had also severely impacted organizations like hers. Four of Mississippi’s 12 community mental health centers had federal cuts to their organization totaling $8.7 million. 
About $3.7 million of those terminations are coming from grants for Communicare, Madaris said. Most of her organization’s cuts were for efforts to prevent addiction-related overdoses and to connect children with mental health services. 
Madaris said Communicare had consistently shown through measures such as job and housing placement data that it had used these types of federal grants to improve Mississippians’ mental health.
“This was completely shocking,” she said. 
With this cut, Madaris said she is nervous about how Communicare and other mental health centers will address needs in their communities. 
“I am terrified, to be honest,” she said. “We’re going to figure it out, we always figure it out. But it’s definitely going to be hard.”

Madaris said the cuts would completely change how Communicare can help children in schools get mental health services and whether North Mississippians can access naloxone, the opioid overdose-reversing medication. It could also mean Communicare may have to reduce its staff. 
“We’re going to have to make some pretty significant changes across the agency,” she said. “It will include programs being stopped and reduction in some of the services that we have been providing for years now through the help of the SAMHSA funding.”
Phaedre Cole, president of the Mississippi Association of Community Mental Health Centers, said cuts to the other three public mental health agencies were also mainly for services related to children and addiction.
Unlike most private facilities, community mental health centers are expected to treat Mississippians regardless of their ability to pay. Cole said that model creates financial challenges that are furthered by SAMHSA’s cuts. 
“Even minor or surface-level cuts go very deep with regard to our long-term sustainability and being able to continue our mission,” she said. 
Mississippi Department of Mental Health spokesperson Adam Moore said the federal government terminated an additional roughly $440,000 from the agency that had been intended to help law enforcement respond to mental health emergencies. The department is aware of the community mental health center grant cancellations and is “still assessing the total impact of the cuts to the state,” he said.
The SAMHSA letter Madaris and the dozens of other organizations received says the federal agency is terminating the contracts to align its grant spending with its priorities. The priorities it lists — addressing mental illness, addiction, suicide and other societal challenges — are similar to what the community mental health centers told Mississippi Today they were doing with their now-terminated grants. 
The letter said the terminations are final. Spokespeople for the federal agency did not respond before publication to a Mississippi Today email asking how much money SAMHSA is canceling from Mississippi organizations, how the grants didn’t align with its priorities and whether new funding would replace these terminated funds.

Sen. Nicole Boyd, a Republican from Oxford and a member of the state’s Opioid Settlement Fund Advisory Council, lives in Lafayette County — a region served by Communicare. She said the organization does a fantastic job of addressing mental health problems in North Mississippi. 
“It’s devastating,” she said of the cuts. “They have been really aggressive and proactive in addressing mental health issues and concerns in our community.” 
Senate Public Health and Welfare Committee Chairman Hob Bryan, a Democrat from Amory, said it’s been difficult to keep up with what the federal government does on a day-to-day basis. He said he and other lawmakers would have to see how the federal mental health cuts play out.
“Obviously, it’s not good news,” he said after his committee met Wednesday. “But in order to know exactly what to do about it or what we might do about it, just have to wait until we get the details.” 
The federal government also cut funds directed to private, nonprofit Mississippi mental health centers, but neither community mental health nor Department of Mental Health officials who spoke to Mississippi Today knew of any as of Wednesday. An executive with one Mississippi nonprofit that received a SAMHSA subgrant administered by the University of Mississippi Medical Center said over $100,000 of its funding was cut Tuesday.

The executive asked not to be named because they had not spoken about the cut with UMMC yet. Patrice Guilfoyle, communications director for the medical center, said she had not heard about any cuts as of Wednesday but would look into them. 
Madaris said SAMHSA also cut nearly  $3 million from Hinds Behavioral Health Services, the community mental health center that serves Jackson. Nyaband Buong, the Hinds Behavioral executive director, said one of her canceled federal grants was $1 million to help navigate a complicated mental health system. 
In March, SAMHSA cut about $4.1 million from Mississippi community mental health centers, saying the funds were initially to address the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time, the centers and their patients told Mississippi Today that those cuts would have life-or-death effects, such as eliminating ways for people recovering from addiction to sustain long-term sobriety. 
In the aftermath of the cuts last spring, Cole said she wasn’t expecting another round this year. 
“I thought we were past any more cuts,” she said. “I was really shocked by this.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/04205937/3X0A0193-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-14 19:57:04.183954

“Who can draw when the world is burning?” asks celebrated Vermont cartoonist Alison Bechdel in her new graphic novel, Spent.
This tension between the political and personal has been a deep well for Bechdel in her art. Bechdel has been cartoonist laureate of Vermont, as well as a recipient of a MacArthur “genius award” and a prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship. 
She garnered a cult following with her early comic strip, “Dykes to Watch Out For.” Her best-selling graphic memoir, Fun Home, was named Best Book of 2006 by Time. It was adapted into a musical that won five 2015 Tony Awards, including Best Musical. Fun Home tells the story of growing up in a family that ran a funeral home, and how, after Bechdel came out as a lesbian, her closeted gay father died in a presumed suicide. 
The cartoonist is also known for the Bechdel Test, which rates movies on whether they include at least one scene in which two women talk to each other about something other than men.
Bechdel is now a professor in the practice at Yale University. She divides her time between teaching for a semester at Yale and living and drawing at her home in West Bolton, Vermont. Bechdel’s wife Holly has been the colorist for her last two books. 
This week, she had an op-ed cartoon featured in the New York Times about how to stand up to tyranny. 
She spoke to me from her home in Vermont.
The following transcript has been edited for length and clarity.

David Goodman
You wrote on social media while sharing your New York Times op-ed that you were especially moved by the murder of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis, because it occurred in a neighborhood that you lived in. Can you say more about that?
Alison Bechdel
I was living in the Powderhorn neighborhood of Minneapolis in the late 1980s when I was starting to create the characters of my comic strip, Dykes to Watch Out For, who I’ve continued to write about over the years, and sort of resurrected quite recently in my latest book, Spent. This cartoon in the New York Times was just a little funny glimpse at the world of this Vermont goat farm I invented for my book, and I’ve brought my old comic strip characters into this world. They live in a group household together, even though they’re in their 60s, they’ve always lived the same way they did when I started the strip out and I was in my 20s. 
It was strange to be working on this cartoon for the New York Times with these characters as that whole terrible story was unfolding. It just hit me so viscerally to realize that any of my characters would have done the same thing she and her wife did, which is stand up to help their neighbors, to alert them to this ICE raid that was going on, and she got blown away. It’s horrifying any way you look at it, but just having this personal connection to that particular neighborhood and the culture of activism in that neighborhood was just very, very upsetting.
David Goodman
Early media accounts referred to Good’s child as having no parent after her murder, but you made the point that the child does have a parent: Good’s wife Becca.
Alison Bechdel
It was kind of stunning how clueless the media were in piecing her story together. They called her relatives, which I guess is what you do. But I started to think, “Oh my God, this is some lesbian. No one has a clue how to figure out who her family is, what her story is.” 
What’s been most upsetting to me is the weird way that the shooter published his own cell phone video of the whole incident, thinking that it was somehow going to exculpate him. That was horrifying. I think he was banking on the fact that these women were clearly not suburban ladies, but a lesbian couple, and Becca Good, a mouthy lesbian, really telling him off. She was harassing him, but in a completely nonviolent way. He somehow thought that was going to win people’s sympathy. That is really disturbing to me.
David Goodman
It reminded me of the 2020 shooting of Ahmaud Arbery, a Black jogger in Georgia. The shooter released his own footage thinking it would justify his actions. Instead, the footage was used to convict him. 
Alison Bechdel
I doubt that’s going to happen in this case, but it should.
David Goodman
As we speak on January 13, the Supreme Court is hearing arguments in a case that may ban transgender kids from participating on girls sports teams. Right now, 27 states ban trans athletes. You have been writing and fighting for visibility of LGBTQ people your whole career. How do you explain the moment we’re in with this incredible backlash against LGBTQ people?
Alison Bechdel
I feel like I’m still in a state of shock. For the past few years, it’s just been one blow after another. It seemed to me as I went along in my life watching progress after progress happen in this movement, that this was something that wasn’t going to go back. I think about Weimar Berlin, and how it was like this little oasis of queer freedom before the Nazis shut it down. And I was thinking, “Could that happen again?” Yes, clearly it could, but I really wasn’t sure. It seemed like maybe we’d reached a tipping point—people understand that we’re not a threat, that we’re just extending democracy to more people. But I guess it’s pretty threatening for the powers that be. I’m a cartoonist, not a political analyst, but that’s my general take.
David Goodman
You are also a very astute social commentator through your cartoons. But let’s turn to your latest piece in The New York Times, “Eight Things You Need to Start Your Own Commune.” Tell us what some of those eight things are and what the deeper meaning of this is.
Alison Bechdel
The idea was to just show the lighter side of banding together during the apocalypse. Like these characters with their group household is just a lighthearted take on the things that they’re doing, like building a safe room in their attic for their trans and immigrant neighbors. It’s evoking this moment that we’re living in and how it’s best done together with our friends.
David Goodman
Which comes right out of your latest book Spent. It is subtitled “A Comic Novel,” but it is also very much a memoir. So much of your work is autobiographical—Fun Home, Dykes to Watch Out For, Secret to Superhuman Strength were drawn from your own life experience. How do you find ways to go back to your own story and tell it differently?
Alison Bechdel
This time I found the well drying up a bit, which is why this most recent book is not strictly memoir or autobiography. It’s based on the kind of life I live now. I’m a character in it. My partner Holly is a character in it. But we’re living on a goat farm, which is not actually—we don’t live on a goat farm at all. I totally made that up. So it was fun to take these fantasies and loosen up the rules about what’s strictly true. And the best part of that was making my friends in this new world, my old characters from Dykes to Watch Out For and seeing how they’ve aged and how they’re still living in that house and doing all the work in the community that they’ve been doing for decades now.
David Goodman
You parody the struggles of a modern, progressive person with fame and fortune, the things that may or may not come with midlife. How much has that been a struggle for you, as it has for the fictional Alison Bechdel in Spent?
Alison Bechdel
I have been improbably successful in my life, when I think about getting started drawing a lesbian soap opera comic strip that ran in the tiniest newspapers that were constantly folding and starting up again. To actually have become someone who’s considered a legitimate figure in the comics world kind of blows me away. It’s come with some strange reckonings. I formed my identity in my youth as this outsider, as this lesbian, as someone who’s not aiming for mainstream fame and fortune, yet I’ve kind of ended up somehow making it or crossing over in a strange way.
David Goodman
What was the moment of crossover? Why do you think your story finally captured people’s imagination in the general public?
Alison Bechdel
That moment came when I published a memoir about my family called Fun Home, which was about my learning that my father was a closeted gay man at the point when I came out to my family and what a strange, disconcerting realization that was. It’s also about his suicide, which happened very shortly after that came out in the open, which is something I was trying to figure out for a long time before I finally started writing about it in my 40s. Somehow that book touched a nerve. My Dykes to Watch Out For work has never quite crossed over to that same extent. It kind of got grandfathered in a bit in the process, which is great, but I think most people know me for that family story.
David Goodman
Now you are wearing a new hat: you’re a professor at Yale. You are new to teaching and you never studied writing. So how do you now teach it, and what is the challenge of teaching college students?
Alison Bechdel
I am having so much fun teaching. This isn’t something I ever envisioned that I would be doing, but the opportunity came up and I deliberated over it, and I’m so glad I pursued it, because it turns out I really like it. I don’t have children. I’m not around young people very much, and it is such an amazing feeling to just talk with and be around young people and to see their hope and their energy. These students at Yale are pretty remarkable. They all do multiple things and many of them are good cartoonists. So it’s really fun to be able to try and teach them things that can help guide them. It’s stuff that I had to learn on my own, because comics wasn’t something you learned in school when I was young. In fact, I applied to the Yale art school to their graduate program in graphic design and didn’t get in because most of my work was weird cartoons, which didn’t really make sense in the early 1980s to anyone who was looking at them.
David Goodman
What has surprised you about working with young people and teaching?
Alison Bechdel
I was afraid that the kids were going to be disaffected or bratty, and it is so the opposite of that. They are so dear. I just feel kind of love for each of these kids that I’m working with. I love helping them to tell their stories, and I find that is something useful I can do. I know a couple things about telling stories, and it’s amazing to watch kids actually take what you tell them and run with it and do more than I even could have hoped for.
David Goodman
You’ve described yourself as a writer who draws. What does that mean?
Alison Bechdel
Different cartoonists map out differently on the writing and the drawing. Some people are really good artists and maybe not such great writers. Some people are stronger writers than artists. I feel like my writing is kind of stronger than my drawing and leads the drawing. Some people, the images lead the way. They would probably call themselves more artists who write.
David Goodman
You have a pretty remarkable partnership with your wife Holly, who is the colorist.
Alison Bechdel
We’ve started working together on my last two books and that’s been so fun. Coloring is really a lot of work and it’s nothing I could do on my own—it would take me twice as long to produce these books. So she has stepped up to learn Photoshop and learn how to create color palettes and it’s a fun way for us to be really collaborating and working closely, instead of me just being off in my room doing this by myself.
David Goodman
Some people might be terrified to work with their spouse. How do you navigate that?
Alison Bechdel
It certainly has its fraught moments, but we’ve gotten a lot better at it. Part of the reason I even became a cartoonist is because I’m such a lone wolf and I like doing everything myself. So I definitely had a learning curve when it comes to collaborating, but it’s paying off, and I’m glad we’re doing it.
David Goodman
I saw an interview with one of your students at Yale who had never drawn. What’s your first bit of advice to somebody with no background in telling stories, in creating art?
Alison Bechdel
I don’t insist that kids know how to draw or draw well at all to take the class. It helps to have some drawing skill but what I’m teaching them is not how to draw or how to write, it’s how to combine those two things. That’s its whole own skill, and some people have a real knack for it but other kids, you can teach it. What are you trying to convey in this story? What’s the best way to do it? Don’t say in the pictures what you can say in the words and vice versa. There are some very simple formulas. It’s a whole new way of telling a story.
David Goodman
What is the key element of a good cartoon?
Alison Bechdel
I think it is the little gap, like in a spark plug, between the pictures and the words. That is just enough space for the reader to come in and make that connection, make the spark. It gives them a way in and just kind of makes the magic happen, unlocks that fusion between those two planes.
David Goodman
In Spent, you lampoon the fact that the main character uses a cartooning program, but there’s a serious element to that. How is AI impacting your world?
Alison Bechdel
In fact, I kind of went over to the dark side a little bit on my latest book, Spent, because I did not draw that all with a pen and paper. I did half of it digitally just because I needed to work faster, and digital drawing is a lot quicker. I’m still drawing it myself, but it’s just on a screen, and it’s kind of different. Interestingly, I used AI for the first time as I was writing that New York Times cartoon—one of the panels is about how to generate your own electricity, given that now the AI data center down the road has jacked up your electricity rates. So I drew myself on a treadmill with my flock of goats and we’re generating our own renewable energy. I asked ChatGPT to make me a drawing of goats on a treadmill, and it did, and I sort of copied it. So who knows where I’m going now—I’m just going right down a chute to hell.
David Goodman
One of the subtexts throughout Spent is the background noise of the incredibly disturbing deluge of daily news. How do we get through these times? What wisdom can you offer from your own experience?
Alison Bechdel
One thing I’m really grateful for is this teaching job because it is so all-consuming I don’t have time to sit around watching the news all day. Does it really help to know exactly what horrors they’re perpetrating? I just try to follow the headlines and I can’t spend any more time than that. I need to do more stuff in the real world, do more activism, connect with my friends. 
David Goodman  
What gives you hope in this moment?
Alison Bechdel  
The protests that are going on. There’s this weird silver lining which is that it is getting more people out into the streets and we’re on our way to that 3.5% tipping point, which gives me great hope.
David Goodman  
And by that you’re referring to if 3.5% of the people are engaged in any form of protest, the regime falls.
Alison Bechdel  
Supposedly that’s been true in history and in different political situations and countries. I certainly hope it’s true here and I hope that we can get to that number. We’re over halfway there in terms of who’s been showing up. People are waking up. Many of us have just been asleep through all of recent history. We’re not going to be around if we stay asleep. It’s pretty dark. It’s pretty bad.
David Goodman  
Thank you for sharing your work and your thoughts in these crazy times.
Alison Bechdel  
Thank you for your work in these crazy times. Just keeping people together, talking to each other, is so important.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez said in a Wednesday hearing that there wasn’t enough time to make an informed ruling on state officials’ request for an injunction on “further legal violations and unlawful escalations” by federal agents reporting to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and legal representatives for the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul filed suit on Monday to stop what multiple state and local officials have called a “federal invasion.”
Menendez did not outright reject Ellison and his co-plaintiffs’ claims, saying only that she needed more time to fully consider the facts of the case, KSTP reported. She asked the federal government for its response to the suit by Monday and for the state to file a reply by Jan. 22. A ruling could follow soon after.
In other legal news, Chris Madel, a Republican candidate for Minnesota governor, told the Star Tribune that he was providing legal counsel to Jonathan Ross, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who fatally shot Renee Good in Minneapolis on Jan. 7.
Madel said he is still running for governor and that he wanted to help Ross get legal representation from the U.S. Department of Justice.
Outside the courtroom, a cold front sweeping through Minnesota had little apparent effect on the thousands of ICE and U.S. Border Patrol agents working in the Twin Cities and outstate. Federal law enforcement activity spread into smaller Minnesota communities, with agents active this week in Detroit Lakes, Circle Pines and multiple Twin Cities suburbs.
St. Paul Public Schools announced on Wednesday it would provide a virtual learning option beginning Jan. 22 for students who do not feel comfortable coming to school amid the surge in federal agents. Minneapolis Public Schools plan to offer a remote learning option for students through at least Feb. 12.
In Minneapolis, bystander video posted to City Council President Elliott Payne’s social media accounts showed agents shoving him off the sidewalk as he met with other local officials near the intersection of Central and Lowry avenues.
Payne told CBS News he was filming a public service announcement with state Sen. Dorian Clark, DFL-Minneapolis, and City Council Member Jason Chavez.
Meanwhile, immigration enforcement may be ramping up at the Hennepin County Medical Center, the state’s largest public safety net hospital, and the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.
MPR News reported Wednesday that ICE agents were entering hospitals with detainees, sometimes without warrants, and — according to five Hennepin Healthcare nurses who asked to remain anonymous — sitting in on patient appointments.
An anonymous Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport employee shared a memo with FOX 9 detailing plans for ICE agents to spend three weeks at the hub checking travelers’ and employees’ documents.
A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Airports Commission told FOX 9 in a statement that “federal regulations provide federal agents with broad access to MSP Airport property [including] the airfield, pre- and post-security areas in the terminals and public spaces like parking ramps and lots.”
Federal authorities are also stepping up their efforts to move detainees not released soon after their arrest for one reason or another through the legal process. The Pentagon plans to dispatch at least 25 military judges to Minnesota, according to CNN, while MPR News reported immigration enforcement agencies appear to have dramatically increased deportation flights out of the state.
ICE appears to need all the help it can get on the ground, too. The agency hired independent journalist and Army veteran Laura Jedeed apparently without even a cursory check of her vocally anti-ICE online presence, Jedeed revealed in an engrossing article for the online magazine Slate.
“It takes about five seconds of Googling to figure out how I feel about ICE, the Trump administration, and the country’s general right-wing project,” Jedeed wrote. In other words, too much time for an agency with more money than it knows what to do with.
Ordinary Minnesotans continued pushing back on the stepped-up federal law enforcement presence. Hundreds of St. Paul public school students staged a coordinated walkout on Wednesday that converged on the state Capitol. Multiple recent polls show solid majorities of American adults disapproving of ICE’s tactics and disbelieving the Trump administration’s official line on Good’s killing.
Perhaps in response, President Donald Trump on Tuesday appeared to soften his stance on Good, who senior administration officials previously called a “domestic terrorist.”
“I would bet you that she, under normal circumstances, was a very solid, wonderful person,” Trump told CBS News anchor Tony Doukopil, who has faced criticism for fawning coverage of the Trump administration since stepping into the role last week.
Trump then added: “But, you know, her actions were pretty tough.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260112_1039-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-14 19:57:04.183954

The postcard, which landed in many Montana mailboxes last week, preceded an announcement this week from the Secretary of State’s Office about a new program to strengthen election security — and its initial results.
The program is a partnership with the federal government to verify voter citizenship. A news release said it is free to election officials.
“Already, the federal government’s SAVE tool flagged 23 records as potential non-citizens, most of which appear to have permanent alien status and no record of citizenship,” the news release said.
SAVE stands for the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements.
“Several of the flagged individuals had voter histories indicating participation in dozens of previous Montana elections,” the news release said.
The postcard shows a picture of Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen and President Donald Trump.
It announces the SAVE partnership between Montana and the Trump administration to “strengthen election security” to disallow non-citizens from voting.
“Only citizens should be allowed to vote,” the postcard said.
To vote in Montana, people need to be a U.S. citizen, at least 18 years old before the election, and a Montana resident for at least 30 days before the next election.
In the United States, some places allow non-citizens to vote in local elections, but Montana does not.
The program, the postcard
In response to questions, a spokesperson for the Secretary of State’s Office directed the Daily Montanan to the news release from the office.
The spokesperson did not address which counties those potential non-citizens were from, when they most recently voted, and when the office would determine whether they were citizens.
However, Missoula County Elections Administrator Bradley Seaman said every vote matters.
Statistically, it’s likely that one of those 23 potential non-citizens is from Missoula, he said, so he is eager to hear what the next steps might be from the Secretary of State’s Office.
“The sooner we’re able to work on this, the better,” Seaman said.
Seaman also said the number indicates the current system is working well; Montana has 784,911 registered voters, and 23 potential non-citizens is 29-one-thousandths of 1 percent.
He said verification takes place using a driver’s license or Social Security number, and a Social Security number is effective, although any system can have errors.
But Seaman also said a non-citizen might have a driver’s license. Usually, he said, the mistakes that happen are when people check an incorrect box on a registration form.
Although Seaman said he believes verification is working well, he couldn’t say whether the new SAVE program will be a benefit to election security because he doesn’t know enough about it yet.
He said his office did not know the state would be sending out the postcard until it landed in someone’s mailbox, and it would be helpful to know about such a program before getting questions about it.
“We love working closely with the Secretary of State, and these are big-scale plans that we would love to know about before they happen to our voters,” Seaman said.
Seaman also pointed to a recent instance in Missoula County where an election outcome could have been affected by just one vote, such as if one of the 23 potential non-citizens were among the local voters.
A city council race in 2023 resulted in a tied vote after a recount, so the Missoula City Council made the decision in an appointment.
“When you have a dead tie on a recount, you feel it,” Seaman said.
Seaman said those outcomes show the importance of verification and voter education, a focus in Missoula.
He said he believes the Secretary of State wants to reverify the 23 potential non-citizens, and Missoula County would want the same.
“If there’s an election coming up, let’s not wait,” Seaman said.
The complaint
The postcard has led to several inquiries with the Commissioner of Political Practices and one complaint, said Commissioner Chris Gallus.
Received on Jan. 9, the complaint alleges a misuse of taxpayer funds.
In the complaint, Montana resident and registered voter Susan Beley of Harlowton expressed deep concern the postcard implied “any random person can vote.”
“This is blatantly untrue as only citizens ARE ALLOWED to vote,” Beley wrote.
“She (Jacobsen) used her State of Montana office and my tax dollars to align herself with the current president (including a photo) in the narrative that has been proven false claiming that ‘elections are rigged’; that ‘someone other than citizens are voting.’”
The spokesperson for the Secretary of State’s Office did not answer a question about how much it cost to produce and mail the postcard.
In the complaint, Beley said Montana already has stringent identification requirements and fair and impartial elections judges, and the mailer builds distrust and “is party aligned.”
“My tax dollars SHOULD NOT fund such propaganda,” Beley wrote.
Gallus said he is conducting an initial review to assess whether the allegations present legal questions that are under his authority and whether he has the factual evidence to support them if so.
Questions include whether the postcard constitutes electioneering or campaign activity, Gallus said. He said the electioneering concept includes depicting a candidate or group of candidates in a way that casts a positive or negative light upon them.
Jacobsen was re-elected as Secretary of State in November 2024 and has not publicly announced a run for any office in 2026.
If the complaint is under his jurisdiction and moves forward, Gallus said he would request a response from the Secretary of State. He said respondents aren’t required to respond, but 99% of the time they do.
In this case, Gallus said the allegations are straightforward, so he anticipates being able to complete his initial review by possibly next week.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_6608-scaled-e1768433925204-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-14 19:57:04.183954

Up until spring 2022, Jeff Corle identified as a fourth-generation dairy farmer tending to his herd of Guernsey cows in Somerset County. But that year, “economic pressures had just caught up to us, and I made the most difficult decision of my life.”
He sold his “beloved and beautiful” cows. 
“I said to the cows, ‘I’m sorry. I’m sorry that it’s come to this, and I’m sorry that somehow I couldn’t have been better and figured out some way to keep this thing going,’” said Corle. “I must have led a charmed life up until that moment, because I honestly didn’t know you could experience so much pain.”

In his bedroom, Corle said he had two items leaning against the wall: a loaded shotgun and a guitar. Picking up the latter brought him unexpected fame when he recorded and released “Empty Barn,” a song he wrote to process his own emotions.
Now, Corle tours as a musician, raising awareness and funds for mental health advocacy work in the agricultural space.
He visibly struggled to share his story before an audience Wednesday that included legislators, farmers and 4-H competitors. The state Senate and House Agriculture & Rural Affairs Committees held a joint hearing to discuss ways to support farmers through mental health crises during the annual Pennsylvania Farm Show in Harrisburg. 
Farmer suicide rates are significantly higher than the rates for the overall population, as detailed by the American Farm Bureau. The profession also has higher rates of depression anxiety and substance use when compared to non-farmers. 
“People are more than statistics. It is safe to say that most people involved in agriculture know at least one person who has struggled,” said Lisa Wherry, a Pennsylvania Farm Bureau member.
 Grant cuts in Pennsylvania

Guiding efforts like the organization’s Farm State of Mind, the Penn State Extension services’ Farm Stress Team works statewide to spread the word about available resources, but are hindered by slow broadband speeds and a shortage of rural health providers. 
But mental health and addiction advocates got a shock Tuesday night when the Trump administration terminated an unknown number of grants distributed through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, estimated to be worth around $2 billion nationwide.
Richard Edly, the president and CEO of the Rehabilitation and Community Providers Association (RCPA), which advocates for mental health and substance abuse treatment providers in Pennsylvania, said the letters came without warning.
Three members Edly spoke to Wednesday afternoon reported losing nearly $4 million dollars.
“No one got any heads up,” he said. “One provider said, ‘We have a three-year contract that we have all staffed up,’” but no money to run the program.

The SAMHSA grants are awarded to both county governments, which are the primary providers of public mental health services, and private contractors that offer services on behalf of the counties.
Melanie Gordon, who oversees human services and criminal justice policy for the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania, said it remained unclear Wednesday whether the cuts were limited to substance abuse treatment programs in Pennsylvania.
“What programs are going to be affected is what we’re trying to wrap our hands around,” Gordon said.
RCPA’s national affiliate, the National Council for Mental Wellbeing, on Wednesday asked its members that received notices their grants were terminated to report it to the organization. It also asked groups to contact their U.S. representatives and senators.
Edly said the Trump administration’s move was “nonsensical” to him and the political goals unclear. He noted that the administration has rolled back sweeping funding cuts in response to political pressure or legal action.
“Are we contacting legislators in Washington just to complain or is there a feeling this can still be impacted?” he asked. “This is really bad, but in Washington there’s always another inning.”
 Many demands, few funds

Gov. Josh Shapiro pointed to millions of dollars invested in student health care and county-level services through the state budget, but acknowledged its limitations. He noted that several federal programs had been cut in the last year, including nutrition assistance and Medicaid. 
“I have said it over and over and over again. We cannot backfill that. We cannot make that up,” said Shapiro. “The consequences of these federal actions are real, and it’s going to hurt Pennsylvanians.
“We’ll make the investments we can make, but we cannot backfill the cuts that they’re making in (Washington) D.C.”

Sen. Elder Vogel, Jr. (R-Beaver), the chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, who oversaw the meeting on mental health, noted that tariffs levied against foreign states had added to the stress felt by Pennsylvania’s farmers. 
“It took us four or five years the last time (President Donald Trump) put tariffs on China to get our soybean exports back … and now they’re gone again,” said Vogel, whose family farm has existed for over 100 years.
He pointed to continued partnerships with organizations like the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau or Penn State to meet the needs of farmers, but acknowledged the budgetary restrictions that come with that. 
“There were $70-some million worth of requests, and we had $10-15 million worth of money to give out,” said Vogel about the budget process. “The need is there. We just have to find the money to be able to fulfill all these requests.”
In the meantime, farmer-turned-musician Jeff Corle said he’d found some success sharing his story with others and in just being vulnerable. 
“I don’t know if we can solve the economic problems today, but if there’s anything we can do for our fellow farmers, it’s to be there,” said Corle.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6315-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-14 19:57:04.183954

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Those wishing to fill the remainder of terms for recently vacated seats in the Nebraska Legislature and on the University of Nebraska Board of Regents must file by the regular 2026 filing deadlines.  
The deadlines are Feb. 17 for any current officeholders and March 2 for others.
A spokesperson for Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen confirmed that those wishing to run for Legislative District 41, in central Nebraska, or the NU Board of Regents in District 4, in eastern Douglas County, will follow regular filing deadlines this year due to the timing of the vacancies.

Both races will appear on the May 12 primary election ballot and the Nov. 3 general election ballot. Two of eight regents seats were already up for election this  year, as were 24 of 49 legislative seats.
The legislative race would be for the final two years of a four-year term vacated by former State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst, who resigned Tuesday. The regent’s race would be to finish the final four years of a six-year term vacated by former NU Regent Elizabeth O’Connor of Omaha, who resigned Friday.
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen on Wednesday appointed former State Sen. Fred Meyer of St. Paul to succeed McKeon. He has not yet appointed a successor for O’Connor. Meyer will serve until at least Jan. 5, 2027, while O’Connor’s eventual successor will serve until at least Jan. 7, 2027. 
Meyer did not rule out running in the special election.

Both O’Connor and McKeon had faced disciplinary action in the Legislature, which has the sole authority to expel senators or impeach constitutional officers. 
O’Connor resigned Jan. 9 after seven years as a regent. She faces a felony charge of drunken driving and causing serious injury in a crash in mid-Omaha last May. The criminal case continues in Douglas County District Court. She has pleaded not guilty.
She had faced possible impeachment. It would have required at least 25 votes to pass. The Legislature last impeached a state official, also a former NU regent, in 2006. Impeachment requires approval from the Nebraska Supreme Court to remove the official.
McKeon resigned Tuesday, after little more than a year in office. He faces a misdemeanor charge of disturbing the peace in Lancaster County Court. He has pleaded not guilty.
He had faced possible expulsion, the debate for which was set to begin Tuesday, until he announced his resignation. Had he not resigned, multiple senators said there were at least 33 votes to expel him, which would have been a first in Nebraska history. 
The resignations ended both disciplinary efforts.
Neither O’Connor nor McKeon would be prohibited from running again this year for the same office. However, O’Connor could not run if convicted of a felony under a provision of the Nebraska Constitution.

(Photos via the Legislature; Capitol photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix.)It’s the Florida House’s turn to address school voucher accounting shortfalls. The Senate on Wednesday unanimously approved its package to fix problems uncovered by a state audit that created major consternation among lawmakers. 
The package SB 318, amending the laws governing the state voucher system, received support in the upper chamber, but its fate is now in the hands of the House, which hasn’t proposed a fix.
“The money is supposed to follow the student, but the students are on the move, before, during, and after the school year by the tens of thousands,” Sen. Don Gaetz, a Republican from Crestview, the sponsor, said during the first floor sitting of the session.
School daze: Rapid expansion of voucher program leaves public, private schools underpaid

In October, lawmakers in the House spent hours questioning Department of Education officials and administrators with scholarship funding organizations about how state funding navigates its way to schools, private and public. The universal vouchers are available for all families, regardless of income.
Not long after, a state audit found that the money was not moving the way it was supposed to. The audit concluded that “funding did not follow the child,” counter to the rallying cry of school-choice proponents that tax dollars should be allocated to students, not schools. 
“Fraudsters, unfortunately, have discovered our school choice program and they scammed millions of dollars by creating fictitious students. Not Minnesota, but not a good look,” Gaetz said, insisting that lawmakers must not let the budgeting problems persist, and pointing to alleged fraud in Minnesota‘s daycare system.
“North of a million” dollars are associated with fraudulent activity, Gaetz estimated during a news conference following the vote. Last year, the Phoenix reported about a private school receiving vouchers to educate students more than 100 miles away.
The Senate bill, more than 4,000 lines long, looks to establish clearer application and scholarship acceptance deadlines and to boost competition among scholarship-funding organizations, which manage the flow from the state to the schools, while providing more oversight to the state.
“A lot of times in government, we roll out things and the implementation part of it is a disaster, and what I appreciate today is not only did you keep us from committing legislative malfeasance, but you brought it publicly that we identified that we implemented a program, we couldn’t find students. We still have questions about money, but we were open, transparent about it, and we are addressing it through this bill,” Democratic Sen. Rosalind Osgood of Fort Lauderdale said.
The governor, Senate, and House all have recognized a need to make changes. The path to get there is not clear, however. The House has yet to propose a fix. 
A key provision from the Senate, differing from House leadership’s philosophy, is separating line items in the budget, creating an appropriation specifically for funding school choice vouchers, separate from overall school spending.
The Senate bill would expand the education stabilization fund to $250 million, something Gaetz said he believes could help the House agree to terms. The fund is supposed to help supplement funding for schools that enroll fewer students than the budget projected.
In the past four years, the voucher program has grown rapidly, serving about 500,000 students during the past school year. In 2021-2022, the program had served about 200,000 students. In 2024-2025, the program dished out $3.17 billion in Family Empowerment Scholarship vouchers and recorded another $804.5 million in scholarship programs funded through corporate tax credits, totaling nearly $4 billion dollars.  
The Senate approved an amendment eliminating a declining-enrollment supplement from the original conversation. Gaetz indicated he has “hope” that, in the budget-making process, that provision will resurface.



Voucher funding problems by the numbers

22-page-audit.
According to Gaetz, at any given moment, 30,000 students are unaccounted for.
Those students represent $270 million in education funding.
In 2024-2025, the DOE paid $655 million to scholarship funding organizations before school started, creating a “paying and chasing” system.
At least $7 million were sent to families by scholarship funding organizations before verifying if the student was attending a private school.
The education budget was $47 million short at the end of the last fiscal year, leaving some districts without money.
The audit found that at the end of last fiscal year, more than $400 million sat, unused, in scholarship accounts.
At the end of the 2024-25 school year, nearly 300 accounts for students with disabilities held “excess balances,” or more than $50,000 each in unspent money. The sum of the excess alone was $2.3 million.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Untitled-design-16-1024x538.png,,,2026-01-14 19:57:04.183954

(Photo by Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)The 2026 regular Colorado legislative session kicked off Wednesday as lawmakers returned under the gold dome of the Capitol in Denver for 120 days to hammer out state policy. 
Leaders of the House and Senate laid out their priorities for the session against the typical backdrop of opening day pomp: the posting of the Colorado and American flags by a military color guard, a saxophone player performing in the chamber gallery and a gaggle of lawmakers’ children leading the Pledge of Allegiance. 
In her final opening day speech as House speaker, Democrat Julie McCluskie opened with a condemnation of political violence and the “caustic rhetoric” in the country. She spoke about the shooting deaths of former Democratic Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband at their home last June, as well as conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was killed at an event on a college campus last September.
“No matter how bitterly we might disagree on the important issues, we have to raise the decency in our rhetoric, together,” the Dillon Democrat said. “Violence can never be the price of democracy.”

She also pledged to “protect the progress” Democrats have made in recent years when it comes to civil rights protections in the state.
“We won’t shove our immigrant and LGBTQ neighbors back in the shadows,” she said. “We won’t give up on disability access or voting rights. We are a model for abortion rights in the post-Dobbs reality, and we won’t roll them back.”
Both McCluskie and Senate President James Coleman touted laws the Democrats passed in recent years with their wide majorities in the Legislature, including measures that protect reproductive rights, increase funding for schools and expand access to health care.
But funding freezes and other threats from the federal government will once again color the session as the second Trump administration enters its second year. The Legislature met last summer in a special session to mitigate the effects of federal tax policy on the state’s budget, and Colorado more recently faced a funding pause for its child care and other safety-net programs as the federal government investigates those services for potential fraud.
“I fear this administration will target Colorado no matter what we do. So members, let’s do what’s right,” McCluskie said. Colorado is a “bulwark” against the unpredictability of Congress and the Trump administration, she said. 
Coleman said the state’s already tight budget environment will be exacerbated by the federal government’s actions. 
“The federal government’s tariffs, haphazard clawbacks of funding for critical programs have sown uncertainty in our economy,” Coleman said. “They threaten our ability to provide the resources Colorado kids, families, seniors and rural communities depend on.”

This year, Democrats hope to grow the state’s affordable housing stock, stabilize health care premiums, streamline workforce training programs and push toward the state’s climate goals.
“We have, and will, work across the aisle to build a better Colorado, because the challenges facing our state demand nothing less,” Coleman said.
Coleman and McCluskie both paid tribute to former state Sen. Faith Winter, who died in a car crash last November. Coleman asked senators to honor her memory in how they show up at the Capitol, calling her a “coalition and team builder for the ages.”
“Faith’s loss is immeasurable, and as we embark on our work this session I hope that we can incorporate her tenacity and the joy that she found in this work into our policies, as well as the conversations we have with one another,” Coleman said. 
Republican perspective
Minority Leader Jarvis Caldwell, a Colorado Springs Republican, commended the Democrats’ efforts to work across the aisle, but he said there will still be “fierce but respectful disagreements on policy.”
He spoke about the essential conservative priorities of his caucus, including parental choice for education and health care, gun rights and opposition to increased regulation, especially when it comes to energy and climate goals.
“We can work toward a cleaner environment, but we must do it pragmatically,” he said, adding that the state’s current trajectory is “activism on a collision course with reality.”
He pushed back on the Democrats’ assertion that federal law, including the One Big Beautiful Act passed last summer, is contributing to the state’s budget challenge.
“The reality is these challenges did not begin this year or with a single federal law. The issues Coloradans are facing have been building for years as a result of state-level decisions,” he said. “Overburdens, overregulation and unprecedented government growth from this building stifle economic prosperity.”
Caldwell also spoke about Kirk’s death, and said it was difficult to witness people “mock” Kirk’s death, especially because many conservatives share his Christian beliefs.

Coloradans want a government that listens to them and respects their work, Senate Minority Leader Cleave Simpson said in his opening speech on the Senate floor. The most urgent priority for the session is to lower costs, and he said Republicans will bring forward ideas “rooted in freedom, accountability, and respect for the people we serve.” 
“Lowering cost means making responsible decisions with taxpayer dollars,” Simpson said. “It means scrutinizing spending, reducing unnecessary bureaucracy and recognizing that every policy choice we make has real consequences for real people. Government should be a partner in affordability, not an obstacle to it.”
First bills introduced
After the opening day speeches, the House and Senate introduced the first batch of bills for the session.

One bill, Senate Bill 26-5, would let a person sue a federal immigration agent over constitutional violations. It comes as U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement agents ramp up operations in cities like Minneapolis and viral videos show officers breaking car windows, tackling residents and teargassing protestors. An officer fatally shot a Minneapolis woman, Renee Good, during an operation last week.
Senate Bill 26-4 would further expand who is able to file an extreme risk protection order against someone under Colorado’s “red flag” law, which allows a judge to temporarily remove a firearm from someone they deem potentially dangerous. It is often used in instances when a person is suicidal. The bill would now allow health care professionals and the facilities where they work to file an ERPO, as well as behavioral health treatment facilities, K-12 schools, and higher education schools to petition a judge as an institution. Legislators previously expanded the law to include educators and mental health providers, but the change hasn’t resulted in a larger number of petitions. Of the 164 ERPO petitions filed in Colorado in 2024, 118 were granted by a judge.  
House Bill 26-1001, dubbed the HOME Act, would let school districts, some nonprofits and transit districts to build housing on their land. A similar bill last year would have also included churches and other faith organizations, but it failed to pass. 
House Bill 26-1002 is bipartisan and would expedite credentialing for mental health and substance use providers to address that industry’s workforce shortage. 
House Bill 26-1005, the Worker Protection Act, which would remove a second election in the state’s union formation law, was also introduced on Wednesday.

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — South Carolina GOP leaders want to add colleges to 2-year-old rules requiring K-12 public school students to use bathrooms and locker rooms corresponding to their biological sex at birth.
A House panel began hearing Wednesday on the legislation sponsored by 60 Republicans that largely mirrors a law that’s been part of the state budget since 2024. Other than making those rules permanent state law, the proposal would extend them to the public colleges.
About 20 people weighed in during the one-hour hearing, with legislators calling on opponents and advocates in rotation. No vote was taken. A second public hearing is planned for Tuesday.
Like the existing rules, the bill’s restrictions apply to multi-stalled restrooms and places where students undress, to include locker rooms and gym showers. During overnight trips, students of different genders can’t sleep in the same room.
Colleges would newly be required to give students in dorms the option of living only with people of the same biological gender.
The penalty would be the same as the budget law: School districts and colleges risk losing up to 25% of their state aid for violations.
Legislators knew of no school district punished under rules first inserted into the state budget during Senate floor debate. While such clauses are technically one-year laws, they carry the same authority as permanent code.
Wednesday’s hearing came a day after lawyers argued two cases involving transgender students before the U.S. Supreme Court. Justices heard back-to-back arguments about laws in West Virginia and Idaho that ban transgender athletes from participating in girls’ and women’s sports teams. South Carolina lawmakers passed a similar ban in 2022.
“In South Carolina, we know what a woman is,” Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey said during a news conference ahead of the House hearing.
“And if it falls on South Carolina to educate the rest of the country about what a woman is, we are happy to,” the Edgefield Republican added.
Legislators contend it’s not a debate over discrimination but one of privacy.
“For generations, restrooms, locker rooms and overnight trips have been separated by sex, not because it was political, but because it’s common sense,” said Rep. Fawn Pedalino, R-Turbeville. “This is not about targeting anyone. It’s about setting firm statewide standards.”
Why now?
GOP leaders said legislation is needed to make the rules more permanent.
“We just want to get this straight and move on so we’re not having to continually deal with it,” said House Speaker Pro Tem Tommy Pope, the bill’s main sponsor.
Transgender SC student drops appeal in bathroom lawsuit after switching to virtual school

But debate to remove budget clauses — called provisos — is rare.
The one-year laws generally roll over from one budget to the next indefinitely, unless legislators specifically vote to take them out. There was zero debate on the bathroom rules last year.
Courtney Thomas of the American Civil Liberty Union’s South Carolina chapter called it election-year politics.
It’s concerning what the Legislature’s Republican leaders decided to highlight during the second day of the 2026 legislative session: “This is low-hanging fruit, unfortunately, to politicize a moment when they need eyes and attention and campaign dollars,” Thomas said.
The ACLU opposes both the existing budget rule and the proposed legislation, arguing it stigmatizes transgender children and adults and opens all people to scrutiny of their gender.
“Let’s just say your daughter or your niece wants to try out a shorter haircut,” Thomas said. “What if someone sees her in a bathroom and decides, ‘Hey, you shouldn’t be here.’ That is harmful for that girl.
“This bill creates an air of suspicion that would ask students and teachers and administrators to police who is and who isn’t feminine enough,” Thomas added.
Other existing laws criminalize harassment and violence in restrooms to protect all South Carolinians, making this proposal unnecessary, she said.
A matter of privacy?
Pope said legislators understand that transgender students have rights, but other students have rights too.
“We want to respect that child. That child can have access to privacy,” said the York Republican. “But to do it, we don’t need to rob everyone else’s daughter.”
A then-eighth grade transgender student in Berkeley County filed a federal lawsuit in November 2024 challenging the budget rule. The student dropped his appeal in October after switching to virtual learning, but the underlying case is still pending.
However, the case is on pause until the U.S. Supreme Court hands down a decision in the cases it heard Tuesday.

Public testimony
Opponents at the hearing included Jessicka Spearman Childs of Anderson County. Her transgender son took summer classes to graduate high school early “because he was exhausted due to bathroom bans in our local high school,” she said.
“This bill is not about privacy,” she said. “This is about making a bathroom into a courtroom. It’s about legislating fear, punishing schools financially and inviting lawsuits over hypothetical situations.”
Spearman Childs, who is nearly 6 feet tall, said strangers have questioned her about her own biological sex. Strangers have asked her to expose her breasts to prove she is a woman, she said.
Cristina Picozzi, executive director of Columbia’s Harriet Hancock Center for the LGBTQ+ community, said people often question the gender of her wife, a military veteran with a short haircut.
“I have seen firsthand how stereotypes impact her,” Picozzi said. “Before her last deployment, we were stopping in Charleston and the person at the counter repeatedly chose to misgender her when we were discussing clothing, even after we offered corrections.”

And when the couple goes out on dates, Picozzi said she intentionally accompanies her wife to the bathroom to prevent harassment.
“South Carolinians already manage privacy in multi-occupancy restrooms every day through stalls, doors and shared norms,” she said. “This bill invites scrutinization of one another’s bodies and identities, which undermines privacy for everybody.”
Picozzi also said 40% of LGBTQ+ youth who attend programs at the Harriet Hancock Center choose home schooling because of bullying in the public school system.
Greg Green spoke Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026, at a House hearing in opposition to a bill restricting transgender bathroom use at public colleges and K-12 schools. (Screenshot courtesy of SCETV legislative livestream)
Greg Green of Lexington, a transgender man, said he’d be attacked if he entered a women’s restroom. “I’m going to be called sick,” he told legislators about what they’re requiring students to do.
Most proponents who signed up to speak voiced their support without giving any personal details.
Elizabeth Enns of York County said “many girls feel exposed, anxious and unsafe. Some have stopped using facilities altogether. Others have suffered harassment or voyeurism.” She did not cite any specific situations.
Marsha Gross, president of York County Republican Women, pointed to the same scenario cited in 2024 by the budget rule’s sponsor. Sen. Wes Climer of Rock Hill said at the time that his proposal was in response to a then-18-year-old senior at Rock Hill High daily using the women’s locker room.
Questions raised
A pair of Democrats on the committee, Reps. Tiffany Spann-Wilder of North Charleston and Jerry Govan of Orangeburg, questioned how much schools might have to spend to comply with the law and whether proponents had any data on the number of complaints against schools. No one did.
Sara Beth Nolan, who represents Alliance Defending Freedom, the group championing the bill, said many schools already have single-stall restrooms, or students can use bathrooms in the school nurse’s office.
In the Berkeley County case, school officials said the student was given the option of using a single-stall bathroom in the nurse’s office. But that wasn’t practical, since it was significantly further away from the student’s classes, according to the lawsuit.
Pope said the only concern he’s heard from colleges is over locker rooms. Colleges often assign away teams to use the opposite sex’s locker room during games. He said he plans to address that with language clarifying that members of male and female teams can’t be in a locker room at the same time.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_3972-scaled-e1768435954613-1024x587.jpg,,,2026-01-14 19:57:04.183954

The Legislature is poised to pass the “Immigrant Safety Act” in the upcoming session. (Patrick Lohmann/SourceNM) New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham will include legislation banning immigrant detention on the agenda for the legislative session starting Jan. 20, her office told Source NM on Wednesday. The Senate majority leader said the bill has growing support and strong prospects for passage.
But even if the Legislature passes and the governor enacts the legislation, two of the state’s three immigrant detention facilities run by a private prison contractor could potentially still be able to operate here.
The proposed “Immigrant Safety Act” would prohibit public entities from working with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency or other federal agencies to house immigrant detainees in the state. Three rural New Mexico counties — Cibola, Torrance and Otero — have agreements with ICE and private prison companies that enable ICE to house a growing number of detainees in local jails.
Torrance County ICE contract extension ‘likely improper and invalid,’ NMDOJ says

If the Legislature passes the bill, counties will be prohibited from joining those contracts, known as “intergovernmental service agreements.” But nothing would stop CoreCivic, a private company that owns the jails in Cibola and Torrance counties, from contracting directly with ICE to continue housing detainees at its facilities, local officials and immigrant legal advocates tell Source. 
That’s what Torrance County Commission Chair Ryan Schwebach presumes would happen, he told Source on Wednesday during a break in the commission’s regular meeting in Estancia.
Schwebach said he strenuously opposes the measure and said it puts the Torrance County facility on the “chopping block” should ICE decide to house detainees elsewhere. 
Brian Todd, a spokesperson for CoreCivic, declined to answer Source’s question about whether the company would contract directly with ICE if the “Immigrant Safety Act” becomes law, instead referring comment to ICE, which did not respond to Source’s request for comment. 
50 NM immigrant detainees say mail issues at jail hurting their legal cases  

Ian Philabaum, a program director for Innovation Law Lab, an Oregon-based immigrant legal organization that does weekly jail visits in Estancia, said Wednesday that CoreCivic contracting directly with ICE is a “plausible” next step for the company, if one that his organization would oppose.
“It is well documented that ICE detention is harmful in all locations, and we believe that ICE detention should be ended in its entirety in the state of New Mexico,” he said. 
According to recent estimates, the Estancia facility currently houses an average daily inmate population of 480 detainees, some of whom have continuously reported poor conditions at the jail, including inadequate access to lawyers, mail, tablets or water. 
The current average population at the Cibola County Detention Facility in Milan is about 217 and is about 850 at the Otero Processing Center in Chaparral.
Unlike the Cibola and Torrance facilities, the Otero Processing Center is county-owned, and would be subject to the “Immigrant Safety Act.” 
Supporters of the bill say it removes New Mexico’s complicity in President Donald Trump’s mass deportation push. ICE arrested at least 1,800 immigrants in New Mexico last year, according to recent estimates. 
Local officials, on the other hand, have said the bill would devastate their towns by eliminating tax revenue and jobs the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency provides to house inmates.
NM committee chair who once stymied ICE detention center ban says he’s reconsidering

Philabaum, however, countered that “to suggest that this bill is going to remove these prisons and is actively aiming to harm these local economies, is disingenuous.”
Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) told Source on Tuesday he believes that a “breakthrough” in his caucus occurred during interim committee meetings this summer, one that means both chambers of the Legislature will approve the bill, he said. He expects they’ll do so within the first two weeks of the session. 
“We have the votes in our caucus to send this up to the governor,” he said. “The agreement certainly is to move forward on an expedited basis, and I’m confident we’ll get this across the line.”
As for the facilities that might be exempt from the bill, Wirth said “those legal issues — understanding the impact on existing contracts, and the lay of the land moving forward with private contracts — are things we’ll discuss. I think the real big signal, though, this would send is that the state of New Mexico no longer should be part of this, and local government should not be part of this, immigration-focused detention.”
NM Republicans — and one Democrat — tour Otero ICE Detention Center 

A comparable bill introduced last year died without a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Sponsors in the state House of the “Immigrant Safety Act” told Source on Tuesday that they will reintroduce a version soon with minor changes. Rep. Angelica Rubio (D-Las Cruces) describes the measure as a first step.
The bill doesn’t “end private detention overnight, but it ends New Mexico’s public role in it and forces any ICE/private prison operations to happen without county help, contracts or public resources,” Rubio said in a text message. “I can speak for my House colleagues I’m working with…that we’re committed to making sure this isn’t the only step we take.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7241-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-14 19:57:04.183954

(Photo by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)The Florida Senate is not giving up on a “rural renaissance.” Wednesday, the second day of the regular legislative session, saw unanimous support in a floor vote for Senate President Ben Albritton’s priority legislation.
The vote sent SB 250, sponsored by the citrus farming Albritton, on it’s way to the House.
Last year, the Senate passed the bill early on but the House wasn’t willing to pass it on to the governor.
“When you look in the eyes of some of my communities, and when I show up for our delegation meetings and they are coming, and I’m telling them to ask, ‘What do you need? What do you need?’ and they’re almost embarrassed to walk into those meetings with their hand out because they’re just hard-working people and honestly they don’t want to ask the government for anything,” the bill’s sponsor, Sen. Corey Simon, a Republican representing 12 rural counties near Tallahassee, said.
“But there are things that are needed in these communities, roads that are torn down, water systems that are failing, and so they do have that need,” Simon said.
Simon called it an à la carte system for rural communities rather than a mandate for them to grow.
“This won’t be the last time that I’m asking for rural Florida,” Simon said.
The bill includes appropriations and policy to expand funding opportunities for rural roads, housing, education, health care, and business.
The bill would increase the threshold for what a “fiscally constrained county” is from $5 million in property tax revenue per 1 mil to $10 million per 1 mil.
Fiscally constrained status is used in statute to qualify certain counties for extra support.
The bill, like last year’s, would create the Office of Rural Prosperity within the Department of Commerce. The office would facilitate planning and connect local governments to state and federal resources.
SB 250 would include a $1 million block grant for counties with declining populations. The grants would target population growth and be available annually until a county achieves three consecutive years of growth.
Rural teachers would be eligible for a student loan repayment program worth $15,000 per individual over five years.
Addressing the health care disparities between patient outcomes in rural and urban areas also is a goal of the legislation, specifically improving outcomes in rural areas for stroke and heart attack as well as obstetric care.
Simon sponsored an amendment to his bill that eliminated from the plan the Rural Access to Primary and Preventive Care Grant Program and the $25 million in the bill to help fund it. The program would have made grants of up to $25,000 available to physicians, physician assistants, and advanced practice nurses, who are authorized to practice independently from physicians, to open offices in a qualifying rural area. Only practices that are at least 50% owned by health care providers would have been able to qualify for the grant money.
The amendment also deleted language that would have updated statutes regarding the Rural Hospital Capital Improvement program to specify what the $100,000 grants under the existing program could be spent on. Specifically, the bill allows for mobile health care units that provide primary care, behavioral health services, or obstetric and gynecological services in rural health professional shortage areas as well as telehealth kiosks.
Last, the amendment deleted a Stroke, Cardiac, and Obstetric Response and Education (SCORE) Grant Program and $5 million earmarked to make it a reality.
The bill initially directed the  Department of Health to award grants to high-risk providers serving rural communities to develop training programs in stroke care protocols and best practices.
A staff analysis cites a Centers for Disease Control study showing that rural Americans are at 30% higher risk of stroke and 40% more likely to develop heart disease and live an average of three years fewer than urban counterparts. The analysis also cites CDC Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System data comparing pregnancy-related mortality in rural and urban areas between 2011 and 2016. The data show the death rate in rural areas was between 19.5-22.4 per 100,000 women compared to 15.7-17.9 deaths per 100,000 women in urban areas.
But the amendment struck the creation of the program
Trump administration awards Florida $209M for rural health improvements

Simon said he removed the provisions because they no longer are required now that Florida has received $209 million in rural health funds, made available  under the federal One Big Beautiful Bill law.
“Thanks to the Big One Beautiful bill, Florida has a unique opportunity to leverage significant federal funds to strengthen its delivery of rural health care,” Simon said.
Simon’s second amendment, more technical in nature, adjusts the funds in the bill directed to the state Agency for Health Care Administration for the development of a new Medicaid reimbursements methodology for federally certified critical care hospitals, or facilities with fewer than 35 beds that provide around-the-clock access to emergency care located in a rural area at least 35 miles from another hospital (or 15 miles in difficult terrain).
The amendment doesn’t lower the overall dollar amount ($437,613) directed to the agency but instead tinkers with how much will come from state general revenue compared to the Medical Care Trust Fund, which is where the state deposits federal health care dollars.

Brian Kemp speaks at 2026 Eggs and Issues. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderLast year, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s priorities going into the 2025 legislative session had an almost singular focus: overhauling the state’s civil litigation system through a series of policies that proponents refer to as “tort reform.”
This year, with the fight over tort in the rearview mirror, Kemp has begun to roll out his plans for his last session in office. During a celebratory speech at the Georgia Chamber of Commerce’s annual Eggs and Issues breakfast, he previewed a series of new infrastructure proposals aimed at easing traffic, investing in natural gas infrastructure and reducing homelessness in Atlanta.
The Republican governor’s full budget proposal will be outlined during his annual State of the State address Thursday. But in his remarks to business leaders during Wednesday’s breakfast, held at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Kemp offered a glimpse into his 2026 wish list, starting with capital projects aimed at reducing traffic.
“Road congestion doesn’t care if you’re a Republican or a Democrat, only that you’re running late to work or an appointment or to your kid’s ball game,” Kemp said. “It costs commuters time with their loved ones and money, it costs businesses valuable production output, and it costs the entire state potential economic development projects.”
Kemp’s proposed budget will include $1.8 billion to expand the I-75 South corridor in Henry County, as well as an additional $200 million to continue work on State Route 316/University Parkway, he said. Communities across the state would also receive an extra $250 million for local road projects, and rural areas would receive $100 million to strengthen or replace failing bridges. Rural communities would also receive an additional $35 million in the amended budget for natural gas infrastructure upgrades under Kemp’s proposal.
“All of this additional funding for transportation projects is certainly needed, but it also has the added benefit of keeping Georgians working in the years to come,” Kemp said.
He debuted a proposal to address homelessness in Atlanta by creating a $50 million grant that will allow the state to work alongside local nonprofit organizations, Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens and other advocates to decrease homelessness.
“This grant will act as a force multiplier to complement the good work already underway by Mayor Dickens and other champions on this challenging issue,” Kemp said.
Legislative leaders float different visions for tax relief for the 2026 session

Funds will provide funding for emergency shelter and transitional housing, mental health and substance use services and other outreach efforts to reduce homelessness in Georgia’s capital city ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which is expected to bring 500,000 visitors to Atlanta, according to some estimates. 
Other legislative leaders also discussed their priorities, with House Speaker Jon Burns highlighting his chamber’s plans to eliminate property taxes on primary residences, while Lt. Gov. Burt Jones pledged to continue lowering the state income tax rate.
“For too many families in our state, the cost of purchasing or building a home has put ownership out of reach,” Burns said. “This doesn’t just impact potential home buyers, it’s also a workforce development issue hurting businesses, job creators and local economies.”
Georgia Chamber President and CEO Chris Clark speaks at 2026 Eggs and Issues. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Chris Clark, the president and CEO of the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, lauded the new investments in Georgia’s infrastructure and efforts to reduce homelessness across the state.
“We all want to look good when the World Cup comes to town, but this is about men and women that live, work, play and pray here,” he said. “I think this was a wonderful announcement today, and hopefully it’s a trend for how states can work with local leaders to address those critical issues.”
On the topic of the Legislature’s dueling ideas for cutting taxes, Clark said he was eagerly awaiting the full proposals, but would not endorse either idea until more details become available.
“What we don’t want is to shift the tax burden from one place to another place, or have to raise taxes somewhere else to make up for it,” he said. “We’ll work with both the House and the Senate, we’ll listen to what their plans are, and then we’ll take a look and see how we weigh in.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)A bill that would prohibit the acquisition of land via eminent domain for carbon sequestration pipelines in Iowa advanced Wednesday from a House committee. 
House Study Bill 507 is one of several expected bills related to property rights and carbon sequestration pipelines expected in the 2026 session. 
Opponents of the bill said it would kill the proposed Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline which, according to lobbyists for the company, already has more than 1,400 easements with willing landowners for the pipeline. 
Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, sponsored the bill and said it protects Iowans’ “fundamental right” to private property.
“Eminent domain should be incredibly rare and must meet the constitutional requirement of a public use,” Holt said. 
Proponents of the bill said it is a simple bill, unlike the bill that Gov. Kim Reynolds vetoed last year that would have restricted the use of eminent domain by CO2 pipeline operators. 
A group of Republican lawmakers have been vocal in their opposition to the carbon sequestration project, which was granted the right of eminent domain by the state utilities commission in 2024. The House passed a similar bill in 2025 to ban the use of eminent domain by carbon capture pipelines, but the Senate did not take up the bill.

Rep. Ross Wilburn, D-Ames, expressed hesitancy advancing the bill Tuesday during a subcommittee meeting on the proposed legislation, because of the Senate’s inaction on the similar bill last year and the governor’s veto.
Wilburn reiterated his concern Wednesday, noting that Reynolds was “silent” on the issue of eminent domain and property rights during her Tuesday Condition of the State address.
“So when I say nothing has changed, the political conditions around this have not changed,” Wilburn, who was one of two no votes on the bill, said. 
Holt responded that neither the House nor the Senate can control what the governor does, nor can the two chambers control one another. 
“What we do is, we do what is right and we move forward and who knows what dynamics might change,” Holt said. 
In addition to bringing tax credits associated with the ultra-low carbon ethanol market, lobbyists for Summit argued in the subcommittee Tuesday the pipeline project would also be an economic opportunity for Iowa due to tax credits for enhanced oil recovery that were recently made available in the federal “big beautiful” law. 
Ethanol producers would have access to 45Z tax credits for producing the low carbon fuel by sequestering carbon dioxide into the pipeline. The carbon sequestration pipeline would be eligible for 45Q tax credits as it transports the carbon to underground storage and now, as that carbon is strategically pumped underground to increase the efficiency of oil wells. 
Holt said the Summit project is not a public use project, but “an economic development project.” 
Holt said public use refers to infrastructure projects like roads, schools or essential energy projects that are “convenient and necessary.” 
“The use of government power to seize property for a private economic development project is not constitutional,” Holt said.
Senate leadership has also indicated it plans to file a bill that would address the property rights issue by allowing pipeline operators to deviate from their state-approved routes in order to find willing landowners. 
House Republicans appear to be united over the eminent domain ban, despite the differences from the Senate. The only other dissenting vote on the bill in committee Wednesday came from Rep. Rick Olson, D-Des Moines. 
House Speaker Pat Grassley said in a Wednesday taping of “Iowa Press” that the House’s narrow eminent domain bill was rolled out early on to show that “it still is something that we really care about.” 
Grassley said the fact that the Senate is working on its own bill is a “positive sign towards finding some level of resolution.” 
“For the last several years, it’s just been bill after bill from the House’s perspective, heading over to the Senate,” Grassley said. “Regardless if we agree with one another, I think it’s a positive step forward … that there’s actual movement on both sides.”

Wooden Knife, the first female president of Rosebud, delivered the annual State of the Tribes speech to a joint session of the South Dakota Legislature on Wednesday at the Capitol.
The State-Tribal Relations Committee endorsed bills on health care and public safety before the session began, and both have been filed and have sponsors.

Lakota and Dakota people have a lower life expectancy than the general population, Wooden Knife said, a sign that the federal government’s treaty obligations to provide for the health of Native Americans isn’t being upheld. Rosebud has sued the federal Indian Health Service more than once for failure to provide adequate health care.
Wooden Knife said the tribes need to look beyond IHS. 
A managed care model for tribal members on Medicaid has the potential to improve outcomes and efficiencies on and off the state’s reservations, she said.
In such a model, tribes could contract with the state of South Dakota to direct federal Medicaid dollars into a pool of funds for health care. An entity of the tribes’ choosing could negotiate costs with off-reservation providers and coordinate care — including preventative care or incentives for healthy habits — for tribal members who seek care on or off tribal land.
“When we stand together for health care, our Sioux Nation tribes, working with the state, can bring the strongest health care resources to the table to improve health care for Native Americans,” Wooden Knife said.
Will Mortenson, R-Fort Pierre, is a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and is chair of the State-Tribal Relations Committee, which endorsed a bill he’s now sponsoring that would create a task force to study a managed care model in South Dakota.

Public safety
The State-Tribal Relations Committee also endorsed a bill that would recognize tribal law enforcement members as certified law enforcement under state law. That would enable legal protections for tribal police who assist state, county or local officers.
On Tuesday, Gov. Larry Rhoden endorsed that bill during his State of the State address. Wooden Knife did the same on Wednesday.
Tribes and state leaders have also pushed in recent years to get more tribal officers trained through the state’s basic law enforcement certification course, as most officers on tribal land are expected to train at a federal facility in New Mexico.
Tribal police to lawmakers: Recognize us as law enforcement

U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, has pushed for a Great Plains law enforcement academy for tribes, a move also endorsed by the State-Tribal Relations Committee, and, on Wednesday, by Wooden Knife.
“We look forward to working with you to improve law enforcement, to get training locally for our police officers, and to improve public safety for all South Dakotans,” Wooden Knife said.
Crow Creek Tribal Chairman Peter Lengkeek, among the tribal leaders on hand for Wooden Knife’s speech, said cooperation between state and tribal officials can work to improve public safety, provided that tribes maintain sovereignty.
For about a decade, Crow Creek has had an agreement whereby state troopers act as a police force on the reservation during its powwow. This year, Lengkeek said, the tribe expanded that agreement. Now the Crow Creek reservation, which can call on Bureau of Indian Affairs officers for aid but lacks a tribal police force, can call upon the Highway Patrol in public safety emergencies.
“We bring them on when we need them,” Lengkeek said.
Foster care
Wooden Knife also encouraged state leaders to work with tribes on foster care. Around 70% of children in foster care are Native American, according to the state’s most recent figures.
Efforts to expand the number of Native American foster homes have shown some promise, but most South Dakota foster parents are non-Native.
“We need an equal chance to preserve our children and families as the future of our Native communities, so the state should enter kinship placement agreements with the tribal governments,” Wooden Knife said, referring to a form of foster care placement that connects children with family members. 
Tribes hope to ‘reset’ state relations after Noem leaves office

There are no bills directly related to foster care and Native American families on the docket for the 2026 session at this point, but Rep. Peri Pourier, R-Rapid City, said she doesn’t expect that’s needed just yet.
Pourier, a member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, is on a group called the Indian Child Welfare Act Advisory Council, a state-level group named for the federal act that prioritizes keeping Native American families together. 
The council was born of a bill introduced and passed in 2024, and Pourier said important conversations about collaboration on kinship care and foster family recruitment are moving forward as a result.
The group, Pourier said, is “getting down to the nitty gritty, and they’re going to work together to see what things that they could come up with.
“If we need to step in with legislation,” she said, “we will.”
Water rights, consultation
Wooden Knife also encouraged the state to be in conversation with tribes on issues of water rights, water pipelines and drinking water access in the years ahead, noting the needs yet unmet by projects like the Mni Wiconi water pipeline. That project was first funded at the federal level in 1988 and needs upgrades, Wooden Knife said.
“As the state Legislature plans for water system improvements, we ask that you stay in touch with the Sioux Nation tribes, because we have senior water rights in the Missouri River basin and we are active water system operators,” she said.
Wooden Knife called for the governor and state lawmakers to meet at least quarterly to address the need for “increased consultation, mutual respect and consideration of mutually beneficial solutions to our shared concerns.”

I’d venture that most high school buildings do not have escalators. Not in Vermont at least. Burlington’s high school students, however, have a big one, right smack in the middle of their makeshift school at the former Macy’s department store.
For five years, the former outlet has served as a temporary home for Burlington High School students. Why? In 2020, high levels of airborne polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs — a known carcinogen — were discovered at their former high school building.
It forced the district and city to demolish the old high school building and construct a new one. It’s set to open (hopefully) by the start of the fall semester. 
The situation prompted Vermont lawmakers to create a state-led testing program, mandating strict limits on the level of PCBs in Vermont’s schools — limits that went well beyond federal Environmental Protection Agency guidelines.
But it has since cost the state millions of dollars, has been a general source of anxiety for superintendents awaiting testing at their districts and has exacerbated the already dire state of Vermont’s aging school buildings.
Now, lawmakers are mulling whether to end the first-of-its-kind program altogether. A bill, introduced last week by House Education Committee Chair Rep. Peter Conlon, D-Cornwall, would terminate any scheduled testing for PCBs in Vermont’s schools.
Schools that have already tested positive would still have remediation and removal costs covered by the state under the bill.
State money to fund the program has since run dry, though. Michael O’Grady, a legislative attorney, said that although the Legislature intended to pay for all of the related testing and remediation, “the reality is those costs were much more than the money that’s available.”
Conlon, meanwhile, called the testing program “the mother of all unfunded mandates.”
It wouldn’t be the first time lawmakers in the House tried to repeal the testing program. 
“The bottom line is, if we’re going to do this, we’ve got to put our money where our mouth is, and say we’re going to pay for everything,” Conlon said Wednesday.
It’s questionable whether other lawmakers will jump on board. But in Vermont’s current political environment — where there appears to be broad agreement that education costs too much — perhaps we’ve reached a tipping point.
Still, the ethics of ending a testing program to detect known carcinogens could get complicated. Rep. Leanne Harple, D-Glover, questioned whether lawmakers might be doing more harm than good in ending the program.
Conlon noted that the point of the bill “is not to say PCBs are dangerous or not dangerous. It’s not about the science, it’s about the funding.”
Still, it “doesn’t mitigate the reality that they are dangerous,” Harple said.
“I understand why we’re doing this,” she added. “I’m really torn on, what is the human cost, if we’re making a mistake.”

In the know
House Republicans hosted a press conference Wednesday afternoon, and like their Senate counterparts — and Democrats too, for that matter — they highlighted an agenda focused on affordability. 
Central to that agenda is education reform — and following through on the path started by last year’s Act 73.
“We also stand ready to follow through on desperately needed education reform. We all know the status quo is unacceptable,” Rep. Pattie McCoy, R-Poultney, the House minority leader, said. “It’s leading to higher and higher taxes with declining performance. Last year, we started on a transformation path, and it’s critical we stay the course.”
McCoy also said the GOP Caucus intends to pursue repeals of the Global Warming Solutions Act and Clean Heat Act.

State officials steering the $195 million federal grant for rural health care transformation told the Senate Committee on Health and Welfare this morning how they are working to put that money into use under a tight deadline.
Things have moved fast and loose with the federal agency administering the funds to the state. When Vermont learned it had been awarded the grant in late December, the agency had little information about the process and timeline set by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Wednesday, officials had slightly more insight. 
The federal agency just sent the Vermont Agency of Human Services a welcome packet, said Jill Mazza Olson, who oversees the agency’s Medicaid and health systems and led the grant application. CMS has yet to meet with representatives from the state, she added.
Committee members were particularly concerned about which providers will qualify as “rural,” making them eligible to receive the funds. Chittenden County is the one part of the state that does not fit the definition of rural that the feds have been using; but, the county is also home to the state’s only high-acuity center.
“I’m concerned about (Chittenden County) for a lot of different reasons, not simply because it’s my district,” said Sen. Ginny Lyons, D-Chittenden Southeast, the committee chair. “But also because it’s fundamental to care in the state.” 
For now, Olson’s understanding is that all providers in Vermont are eligible for the rural health transformation grant funds, regardless of location, so long as the money benefits rural patients. But, if one thing’s clear about how these rural health dollars are set to be used, it’s that the state still needs to learn a whole lot more.

Vermont Gov. Phil Scott wants to use the state’s annual midyear budget tuneup to set aside $75 million for property tax relief. But legislative leaders said they would rather hold on to that money, at least for the time being.
“It’s just not appropriate to be doing it at this point in time,” said Rep. Robin Scheu, D-Middlebury, who chairs the budget-writing House Appropriations Committee.
At issue is how lawmakers will contend with the nearly 12% average increase in property taxes projected this year across the state. To blunt that expected hike, Scott wants to include about $75 million in this year’s Budget Adjustment Act.

Immigration agents have put civilians’ lives at risk using more than their guns.
An agent in Houston put a teenage citizen into a chokehold, wrapping his arm around the boy’s neck, choking him so hard that his neck had red welts hours later. A black-masked agent in Los Angeles pressed his knee into a woman’s neck while she was handcuffed; she then appeared to pass out. An agent in Massachusetts jabbed his finger and thumb into the neck and arteries of a young father who refused to be separated from his wife and 1-year-old daughter. The man’s eyes rolled back in his head and he started convulsing.
After George Floyd’s murder by a police officer six years ago in Minneapolis — less than a mile from where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed Renee Good last week — police departments and federal agencies banned chokeholds and other moves that can restrict breathing or blood flow.
But those tactics are back, now at the hands of agents conducting President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign.
Examples are scattered across social media. ProPublica found more than 40 cases over the past year of immigration agents using these life-threatening maneuvers on immigrants, citizens and protesters. The agents are usually masked, their identities secret. The government won’t say if any of them have been punished.
In nearly 20 cases, agents appeared to use chokeholds and other neck restraints that the Department of Homeland Security prohibits “unless deadly force is authorized.”
About two dozen videos show officers kneeling on people’s necks or backs or keeping them face down on the ground while already handcuffed. Such tactics are not prohibited outright but are often discouraged, including by federal trainers, in part because using them for a prolonged time risks asphyxiation.
We reviewed footage with a panel of eight former police officers and law enforcement experts. They were appalled.
This is what bad policing looks like, they said. And it puts everyone at risk.
“I arrested dozens upon dozens of drug traffickers, human smugglers, child molesters — some of them will resist,” said Eric Balliet, who spent more than two decades working at Homeland Security Investigations and Border Patrol, including in the first Trump administration. “I don’t remember putting anybody in a chokehold. Period.”
“If this was one of my officers, he or she would be facing discipline,” said Gil Kerlikowske, a longtime police chief in Seattle who also served as Customs and Border Protection commissioner under President Barack Obama. “You have these guys running around in fatigues, with masks, with ‘Police’ on their uniform,” but they aren’t acting like professional police.
Over the past week, the conduct of agents has come under intense scrutiny after an ICE officer in Minneapolis killed Good, a mother of three. The next day, a Border Patrol agent in Portland, Oregon, shot a man and woman in a hospital parking lot.
Top administration officials rushed to defend the officers. Speaking about the agent who shot Good, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said, “This is an experienced officer who followed his training.”
Officials said the same thing to us after we showed them footage of officers using prohibited chokeholds. Federal agents have “followed their training to use the least amount of force necessary,” department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.
“Officers act heroically to enforce the law and protect American communities,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said.
Both DHS and the White House lauded the “utmost professionalism” of their agents.
Our compilation of incidents is far from complete. Just as the government does not count how often it detains citizens or smashes through vehicle windows during immigration arrests, it does not publicly track how many times agents have choked civilians or otherwise inhibited their breathing or blood flow. We gathered cases by searching legal filings, social media posts and local press reports in English and Spanish.
Given the lack of any count over time, it’s impossible to know for certain how agents’ current use of the banned and dangerous tactics compares with earlier periods.
But former immigration officials told us they rarely heard of such incidents during their long tenures. They also recalled little pushback when DHS formally banned chokeholds and other tactics in 2023; it was merely codifying the norm.
That norm has now been broken.
 One of the citizens whom agents put in a chokehold was 16 years old.

Tenth grader Arnoldo Bazan and his father were getting McDonald’s before school when their car was pulled over by unmarked vehicles. Masked immigration agents started banging on their windows. As Arnoldo’s undocumented father, Arnulfo Bazan Carrillo, drove off, the terrified teenager began filming on his phone. The video shows the agents repeatedly ramming the Bazans’ car during a slow chase through the city.
Bazan Carrillo eventually parked and ran into a restaurant supply store. When Arnoldo saw agents taking his father violently to the ground, Arnoldo went inside too, yelling at the agents to stop.
One agent put Arnoldo in a chokehold while another pressed a knee into his father’s neck. “I was going to school!” the boy pleaded. He said later that when he told the agent he was a citizen and a minor, the agent didn’t stop.
“I started screaming with everything I had, because I couldn’t even breathe,” Arnoldo told ProPublica, showing where the agent’s hands had closed around his throat. “I felt like I was going to pass out and die.”
DHS’ McLaughlin accused Arnoldo’s dad of ramming his car “into a federal law enforcement vehicle,” but he was never charged for that, and the videos we reviewed do not support this claim. Our examination of his criminal history — separate from any immigration violations — found only that Bazan Carrillo pleaded guilty a decade ago to misdemeanor driving while intoxicated.
McLaughlin also said the younger Bazan elbowed an officer in the face as he was detained, which the teen denies. She said that Arnoldo was taken into custody to confirm his identity and make sure he didn’t have any weapons. McLaughlin did not answer whether the agent’s conduct was justified.
Experts who reviewed video of the Bazans’ arrests could make no sense of the agents’ actions.
“Why are you in the middle of a store trying to grab somebody?” said Marc Brown, a former police officer turned instructor who taught ICE and Border Patrol officers at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers. “Your arm underneath the neck, like a choking motion? No! The knee on the neck? Absolutely not.”
DHS revamped its training curriculum after George Floyd’s murder to underscore those tactics were out of bounds, Brown said. “DHS specifically was very big on no choking,” he said. “We don’t teach that. They were, like, hardcore against it. They didn’t want to see anything with the word ‘choke.’”
 After agents used another banned neck restraint — a carotid hold — a man started convulsing and passed out.

In early November, ICE agents in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, stopped a young father, Carlos Sebastian Zapata Rivera, as he drove with his family. They had come for his undocumented wife, whom they targeted after she was charged with assault for allegedly stabbing a co-worker in the hand with scissors.
Body camera footage from the local police, obtained by ProPublica, captured much of what happened. The couple’s 1-year-old daughter began crying. Agents surrounded the car, looking in through open doors.
According to the footage, an agent told Zapata Rivera that if his wife wouldn’t come out, they would have to arrest him, too — and their daughter would be sent into the foster system. The agent recounted the conversation to a local cop: “Technically, I can arrest both of you,” he said. “If you no longer have a child, because the child is now in state custody, you’re both gonna be arrested. Do you want to give your child to the state?”
Zapata Rivera, who has a pending asylum claim, clung to his family. His wife kept saying she wouldn’t go anywhere without her daughter, whom she said was still breastfeeding. Zapata Rivera wouldn’t let go of either of them.
Federal agents seemed conflicted on how to proceed. “I refuse to have us videotaped throwing someone to the ground while they have a child in their hands,” one ICE agent told a police officer at the scene.
But after more than an hour, agents held down Zapata Rivera’s arms. One, who Zapata Rivera’s lawyer says wore a baseball cap reading “Ne Quis Effugiat” — Latin for “So That None Will Escape” — pressed his thumbs into the arteries on Zapata Rivera’s neck. The young man then appeared to pass out as bystanders screamed.
The technique is known as a carotid restraint. The two carotid arteries carry 70% of the brain’s blood flow; block them, and a person can quickly lose consciousness. The tactic can cause strokes, seizures, brain damage — and death.
“Even milliseconds or seconds of interrupted blood flow to the brain can have serious consequences,” Dr. Altaf Saadi, a neurologist and associate professor at Harvard Medical School, told us. Saadi said she couldn’t comment on specific cases, “but there is no amount of training or method of applying pressure on the neck that is foolproof in terms of avoiding neurologic damage.”
In a bystander video of Zapata Rivera’s arrest, his eyes roll back in his head and he suffers an apparent seizure, convulsing so violently that his daughter, seated in his lap, shakes with him.
“Carotid restraints are prohibited unless deadly force is authorized,” DHS’ use-of-force policy states. Deadly force is authorized only when an officer believes there’s an “imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury” and there is “no alternative.”
In a social media post after the incident and in its statement to ProPublica, DHS did not cite a deadly threat. Instead, it referenced the charges against Zapata Rivera’s wife and suggested he had only pretended to have a medical crisis while refusing help from paramedics. “Imagine FAKING a seizure to help a criminal escape justice,” the post said.
“These statements were lies,” Zapata Rivera alleges in an ongoing civil rights lawsuit he filed against the ICE agent who used the carotid restraint. His lawyer told ProPublica that Zapata Rivera was disoriented after regaining consciousness; the lawsuit says he was denied medical attention. (Representatives for Zapata Rivera declined our requests for an interview with him. His wife has been released on bond, and her assault case awaits trial.)
A police report and bodycam footage from Fitchburg officers at the scene, obtained via a public records request, back up Zapata Rivera’s account of being denied assistance. “He’s fine,” an agent told paramedics, according to footage. The police report says Zapata Rivera wanted medical attention but “agents continued without stopping.”
Saadi, the Harvard neurologist, said that as a general matter, determining whether someone had a seizure is “not something even neurologists can do accurately just by looking at it.”
 DHS policy bars using chokeholds and carotid restraints just because someone is resisting arrest. Agents are doing it anyway.

When DHS issued restrictions on chokeholds and carotid restraints, it stated that the moves “must not be used as a means to control non-compliant subjects or persons resisting arrest.” Deadly force “shall not be used solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing subject.”
But videos reviewed by ProPublica show that agents have been using these restraints to do just that.
In Los Angeles in June, masked officers from ICE, Border Patrol and other federal agencies pepper-sprayed and then tackled another citizen, Luis Hipolito. As Hipolito struggled to get away, one of the agents put him in a chokehold. Another pointed a Taser at bystanders filming.
Then Hipolito’s body began to convulse — a possible seizure. An onlooker warned the agents, “You gonna let him die.”
When officers make a mistake in the heat of the moment, said Danny Murphy, a former deputy commissioner of the Baltimore Police Department, they need to “correct it as quickly as possible.”
That didn’t happen in Hipolito’s case. The footage shows the immigration agent not only wrapping his arm around Hipolito’s neck as he takes him down but also sticking with the chokehold after Hipolito is pinned on the ground.
The agent’s actions are “dangerous and unreasonable,” Murphy said.
Asked about the case, McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, said that Hipolito was arrested for assaulting an ICE officer. Hipolito’s lawyers did not respond to ProPublica’s requests for comment.
According to the Los Angeles Times, Hipolito limped into court days after the incident. Another citizen who was with him the day of the incident was also charged, but her case was dropped. Hipolito pleaded not guilty and goes to trial in February.
 Some of the conduct in the footage isn’t banned — but it’s discouraged and dangerous.

A video from Los Angeles shows a Colombian-born TikTokker who often filmed ICE apparently passed out after officers pulled her from her Tesla and knelt on her neck. Another video shows a DoorDash driver in Portland, Oregon, screaming for air as four officers pin him face down in the street. “Aire, aire, aire,” he says. “No puedo respirar” — I can’t breathe. Then: “Estoy muriendo” — I’m dying. A third video, from Chicago, shows an agent straddling a citizen and repeatedly pressing his face into the asphalt. Onlookers yell that the man can’t breathe.
Placing a knee on a prone subject’s neck or weight on their back isn’t banned under DHS’ use-of-force policy, but it can be dangerous — and the longer it goes on, the higher the risk that the person won’t be able to breathe.
“You really don’t want to spend that amount of time just trying to get somebody handcuffed,” said Kerlikowske, the former CPB commissioner, of the video of the arrest in Portland.
Brown, the former federal instructor and now a lead police trainer at the University of South Carolina, echoed that. “Once you get them handcuffed, you get them up, get them out of there,” he said. “If they’re saying they can’t breathe, hurry up.”

Taking a person down to the ground and restraining them there can be an appropriate way to get them in handcuffs, said Seth Stoughton, a former police officer turned law professor who also works at the University of South Carolina. But officers have long known to make it quick. By the mid-1990s, the federal government was advising officers against keeping people prolongedly in a prone position.
When a federal agent kneeled on the neck of an intensive care nurse in August, she said she understood the danger she was in and tried to scream.
“I knew that the amount of pressure being placed on the back of my neck could definitely hurt me,” said Amanda Trebach, a citizen and activist who was arrested in Los Angeles while monitoring immigration agents. “I was having a hard time breathing because my chest was on the ground.”
McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, said Trebach impeded agents’ vehicles and struck them with her signs and fists.
Trebach denies this. She was released without any charges.
 Protesters have also been choked and strangled.

In the fall, a protester in Chicago refused to stand back after a federal agent told him to do so. Suddenly, the agent grabbed the man by the throat and slammed him to the ground.
“No, no!” one bystander exclaims. “He’s not doing anything!”
DHS’ McLaughlin did not respond to questions about the incident.
Along with two similar choking incidents at protests outside of ICE facilities, this is one of the few videos in which the run-up to the violence is clear. And the experts were aghast.
“Without anything I could see as even remotely a deadly force threat, he immediately goes for the throat,” said Ashley Heiberger, a retired police captain from Pennsylvania who frequently testifies in use-of-force cases. Balliet, the former immigration official, said the agent turned the scene into a “pissing contest” that was “explicitly out of control.”
“It’s so clearly excessive and ridiculous,” Murphy said. “That’s the kind of action which should get you fired.”
“How big a threat did you think he was?” Brown said, noting that the officer slung his rifle around his back before grabbing and body-slamming the protester. “You can’t go grab someone just because they say, ‘F the police.’”
 Roving patrols + unplanned arrests = unsafe tactics.

In November, Border Patrol agents rushed into the construction site of a future Panda Express in Charlotte, North Carolina, to check workers’ papers. When one man tried to run, an officer put him in a chokehold and later marched him out, bloodied, to a waiting SUV.
The Charlotte operation was one of Border Patrol’s many forays into American cities, as agents led by commander-at-large Gregory Bovino claimed to target “criminal illegal aliens” but frequently chased down landscapers, construction workers and U.S. citizens in roving patrols through predominantly immigrant or Latino communities.
Freelance photographer Ryan Murphy, who had been following Border Patrol’s convoys around Charlotte, documented the Panda Express arrest.
“Their tactics are less sophisticated than you would think,” he told ProPublica. “They sort of drive along the streets, and if they see somebody who looks to them like they could potentially be undocumented, they pull over.”
Experts told ProPublica that if officers are targeting a specific individual, they can minimize risks by deciding when, where and how to take them into custody. But when they don’t know their target in advance, chaos — and abuse — can follow.
“They are encountering people they don’t know anything about,” said Scott Shuchart, a former assistant director at ICE.
“The stuff that I’ve been seeing in the videos,” Kerlikowske said, “has been just ragtag, random.”
There may be other factors, too, our experts said, including quotas and a lack of consequences amid gutted oversight. With officers wearing masks, Shuchart said, “even if they punch grandma in the face, they won’t be identified.”
As they sweep into American cities, immigration officers are unconstrained — and, the experts said, unprepared. Even well-trained officers may not be trained for the environments where they now operate. Patrolling a little-populated border region takes one set of skills. Working in urban areas, where citizens — and protesters — abound, takes another.
DHS and Bovino did not respond to questions about their agents’ preparation or about the chokehold in Charlotte.
 Experts may think there’s abuse. Holding officers to account? That’s another matter.

Back in Houston, immigration officers dropped 16-year-old Arnoldo off at the doorstep of his family home a few hours after the arrest. His neck was bruised, and his new shirt was shredded. Videos taken by his older sisters show the soccer star struggling to speak through sobs.
Uncertain what exactly had happened to him, his sister Maria Bazan took him to Texas Children’s Hospital, where staff identified signs of the chokehold and moved him to the trauma unit. Hospital records show he was given morphine for pain and that doctors ordered a dozen CT scans and X-rays, including of his neck, spine and head.
From the hospital, Maria called the Houston Police Department and tried to file a report, the family said. After several unsuccessful attempts, she took Arnoldo to the department in person, where she says officers were skeptical of the account and their own ability to investigate federal agents.
Arnoldo had filmed much of the incident, but agents had taken his phone. He used Find My to locate the phone — at a vending machine for used electronics miles away, close to an ICE detention center. The footage, which ProPublica has reviewed, backed the family’s account of the chase.
The family says Houston police still haven’t interviewed them. A department spokesperson told ProPublica it was not investigating the case, referring questions to DHS. But the police have also not released bodycam footage and case files aside from a top sheet, citing an open investigation.
“We can’t do anything,” Maria said one officer told her. “What can HPD do to federal agents?”
Elsewhere in the country, some officials are trying to hold federal immigration officers to account.
In California, the state Legislature passed bills prohibiting immigration officers from wearing masks and requiring them to display identification during operations.
In Illinois, Gov. JB Pritzker signed a law that allows residents to sue any officer who violates state or federal constitutional rights. (The Trump administration quickly filed legal challenges against California and Illinois, claiming their new laws are unconstitutional.)
In Colorado, Durango’s police chief saw a recent video of an immigration officer using a chokehold on a protester and reported it to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, which announced it was looking into the incident.
In Minnesota, state and local leaders are collecting evidence in Renee Good’s killing even as the federal government cut the state out of its investigation.
Arnoldo is still waiting for Houston authorities to help him, still terrified that a masked agent will come first. Amid soccer practice and making up schoolwork he missed while recovering, he watches and rewatches the videos from that day. The car chase, the chokehold, his own screams at the officers to leave his dad alone. His father in the driver’s seat, calmly handing Arnoldo his wallet and phone while stopping mid-chase for red lights.
The Bazan family said agents threatened to charge Arnoldo if his dad didn’t agree to be deported. DHS spokesperson McLaughlin did not respond when asked about the alleged threat. Arnoldo’s dad is now in Mexico.
Asked why an officer choked Arnoldo, McLaughlin pointed to the boy’s alleged assault with his elbow, adding, “The federal law enforcement officer graciously chose not to press charges.”

How we did it
Nicole Foy is ProPublica’s Ancil Payne Fellow, reporting on immigration and labor. journalists Nicole Foy, McKenzie Funk, Joanna Shan, Haley Clark and Cengiz Yar gathered videos via Spanish and English social media posts, local press reports and court records. We then sent a selection of these videos to eight police experts and former immigration officials, along with as much information as we could gather about the lead-up to and context of each incident. The experts analyzed the videos with us, explaining when and how officers used dangerous tactics that appeared to go against their training or that have been banned under the Department of Homeland Security’s use-of-force policy.
We also tried to contact every person we could identify being choked or kneeled on. In some cases, we also reached out to bystanders.
Research reporter Mariam Elba conducted criminal record searches of every person we featured in this story. She also attempted to fact-check the allegations that DHS made about the civilians and their arrests. Our findings are not comprehensive because there is no universal criminal record database.
We also sent every video cited in this story to the White House, DHS, CBP, ICE, border czar Tom Homan and Border Patrol’s Gregory Bovino.

La caída de la tasa de libertad condicional demuestra que eso no es una garantía.,Joe Garcia,,,,,https://calmatters.org/calmatters-en-espanol/2026/01/muchos-presos-de-california-reciben-una-segunda-oportunidad-la-caida-de-la-tasa-de-libertad-condicional-demuestra-que-eso-no-es-una-garantia/,"Muchos presos de California pueden tener la oportunidad de ser liberados gracias a la ampliación de la libertad condicional. Sin embargo, para obtenerla, es necesario demostrar crecimiento personal y responsabilidad ante la Junta de Libertad Condicional estatal.","This article is also available in English. Read it here.
Miles de presos en California comparecen cada año ante la Junta de Audiencias de Libertad Condicional con la esperanza de obtener la libertad. Es una situación desalentadora que implica un alto riesgo para todos los involucrados.
Los comisionados de libertad condicional deben cumplir con las normas legales, a la vez que consideran las cuestiones de rehabilitación, seguridad pública y los daños duraderos causados por el delito cometido. Los delincuentes condenados deben intentar presentarse con sinceridad , con todo y sus defectos, mientras se discuten abiertamente sus expedientes de custodia y evaluaciones de riesgo psicológico. Las víctimas y los fiscales asisten a las audiencias, generalmente para argumentar en contra de la libertad condicional. De vez en cuando, abogan por la liberación de la persona encarcelada.
Aparte del poder de veto del gobernador , las conclusiones de los comisionados suelen ser la última medida preventiva contra la liberación de un exdelincuente. Los comisionados reciben una capacitación exhaustiva y son muy cuidadosos al decidir si alguien es apto para la libertad condicional, como lo demuestra una tasa de reincidencia inferior al 3%, lo que significa que el 97% de los presos en libertad condicional nunca reinciden. Menos del 1% reincide por delitos de violencia contra otra persona.
Durante la última década, aproximadamente, California amplió las oportunidades de libertad condicional para las personas condenadas por delitos cometidos durante su juventud y para los presos de edad avanzada. El número anual de audiencias de libertad condicional aumentó de forma constante: de 5226 en 2018 a 9017 en 2022, antes de estabilizarse en unas 8000 en 2023 y permanecer en ese nivel. La población carcelaria del estado también se redujo significativamente durante esos años, de 128 000 en 2018 a unas 90 000 en la actualidad.
 El Departamento de Correccionales y Rehabilitación de California ha intentado cambiar su modelo de encarcelamiento para centrarse en la liberación y la reinserción social de los reclusos jóvenes. Ofrecer mejores oportunidades a los reclusos jóvenes al inicio de su encarcelamiento puede ayudarlos a evitar los riesgos del consumo de drogas, la violencia y las pandillas en prisión. Los reclusos mayores generalmente tienden a superar su comportamiento delictivo previo con la edad.
Al incentivar los programas de rehabilitación, el tratamiento del abuso de sustancias y la educación superior, el sistema ahora aspira a ayudar a los delincuentes a trabajar productivamente hacia el crecimiento y la superación personal.
Pero al mismo tiempo, incluso con aparentemente muchas más oportunidades e incentivos, la tasa de éxito de los presos que solicitan ser considerados para la libertad condicional ha disminuido gradualmente: del 39% en 2018 al aproximadamente 35% entre 2019 y 2021, y a menos del 25% en 2025.
CalMatters conversó con expertos en libertad condicional para comprender la dinámica detrás de las cifras. Nadie pudo señalar una única razón para la significativa disminución en las tasas de concensión de las peticiones de libertad condicional; los expertos, en cambio, afirmaron que esta tendencia descendente puede atribuirse a diversos factores.
Esto es lo que descubrimos con esta investigación: 
Algunos presos de edad avanzada tienen dificultades en las audiencias
 Muchos presos mayores de California con cadena perpetua comenzaron sus condenas hace décadas, cuando las oportunidades de libertad condicional eran escasas. Creían, lógicamente, que no tenían esperanza de obtenerla. Muchos se quedaron atrapados en prisiones remotas sin acceso a programas de rehabilitación. Ahora enfrentan desafíos significativos para comprender y articular plenamente las pruebas de transformación personal que exigen los comisionados de libertad condicional, como la comprensión, el remordimiento y la responsabilidad.
“El número de personas mayores que ahora pueden optar a la libertad condicional está aumentando significativamente”, afirmó Lilli Paratore, directora de servicios legales de UnCommon Law, una organización que representa a decenas de aspirantes a la libertad condicional cada año sin costo alguno para los presos. “En 2013, solo el 19% de las audiencias eran para mayores de 60 años, pero ahora el 32% de las audiencias son para personas mayores de 60 años, y, por supuesto, esto refleja el envejecimiento de la población carcelaria”.
Aproximadamente 19,000 presos tienen 55 años o más, según la propuesta de presupuesto estatal que el gobernador Gavin Newsom publicó este mes.
 Y a medida que estos presos mayores envejecen, su salud mental y física puede deteriorarse y afectar negativamente su capacidad para presentarse ante la junta de libertad condicional. En lugar de prepararse mejor con el tiempo, las reiteradas denegaciones de libertad condicional solo los dejan cada vez más frustrados, confundidos y desanimados. 
 Menos urgencia por parte de algunos jóvenes infractores
 Los riesgos no son los mismos para los delincuentes sin cadena perpetua que cometieron delitos siendo menores de 26 años. La ampliación de las oportunidades de libertad condicional ahora les permite comparecer ante la junta después de 15 años. A diferencia de los condenados a cadena perpetua, saben que tienen una fecha de liberación predeterminada. Que les nieguen la libertad condicional podría significar esperar otros cinco o diez años para volver a casa, en lugar de potencialmente no ser considerados aptos para la libertad.
 Además, es posible que los jóvenes no aprovechen al máximo esos primeros 15 años tras las rejas para rehabilitarse. Algunos lo hacen, pero muchos flaquean antes de descubrirse a sí mismos. Suelen ver su audiencia de libertad condicional como una oportunidad para cumplir una condena reducida, en lugar de como su única oportunidad de libertad.
 En cambio, los delincuentes juveniles que cumplen cadena perpetua tienen su primera oportunidad de libertad condicional tras cumplir un mínimo de 20 o, más habitualmente, 25 años. Esto, naturalmente, les da más tiempo para madurar y prepararse para una audiencia. Aprecian la libertad condicional de una manera que quienes no cumplen cadena perpetua no pueden, ya que sus condenas son indefinidas. 
Barra alta para los delincuentes sexuales
 Los delitos sexuales generan el mayor escrutinio en las audiencias de libertad condicional y despiertan la mayor cantidad de alertas psicológicas. Debido a la dificultad para hablar abiertamente de estos delitos en grupos de discusión, especialmente en comunidades carcelarias, pocos programas de rehabilitación están diseñados para abordar los desencadenantes específicos, los factores causales y los sistemas de creencias erróneos que los sustentan.
 “Hay muchos tipos diferentes de personas que cometen delitos sexuales por una gran variedad de razones, y una programación eficaz para estas personas debe adaptarse a ese problema específico”, dijo Jennifer Shaffer, exdirectora ejecutiva de la Junta de Audiencias de Libertad Condicional. “Así, por ejemplo, hay sádicos, personas que se excitan físicamente torturando a otras personas. Eso es muy diferente de alguien que tiene problemas de ira y los expresa básicamente dominando sexualmente a alguien”.
Debido a que es mucho más difícil para los delincuentes sexuales demostrar a la junta de libertad condicional la comprensión y transformación personal necesarias, los comisionados de libertad condicional tienen menos probabilidades de absolver a estos delincuentes por no considerarlos ya un “riesgo para la seguridad pública”.
 Parte del problema radica en que a los agresores sexuales les resulta más difícil superar una evaluación de riesgo psicológico. “Por horrible que suene, es posible que en algún momento hayan equiparado el dolor con la excitación sexual, y romper esa conexión es realmente difícil y requiere una programación muy intensa”, afirmó Shaffer. 
 La huella digital de un prisionero
 Los comisionados de libertad condicional revisan el expediente completo de una persona días antes de su audiencia y tienen la tarea de interpretar todos los hechos desde la perspectiva de la seguridad pública. Cualquier información, como registros de visitas, informes, gastos personales y más, podría considerarse pertinente.
 “En los últimos años, el volumen de información que la junta analiza ha aumentado, aunque no esté necesariamente relacionada con el riesgo de violencia”, dijo Paratore. “Se centran cada vez más en el fraude (por desempleo) y la evasión de indemnizaciones. Analizan los historiales médicos. Analizan cada vez más la información confidencial.
“Lo que creen que deben considerar ha aumentado sin ningún tipo de parámetros, lo que ha resultado en que a más personas se les niegue la libertad condicional porque la junta no sabe interpretar correctamente esa información. Esto aplica especialmente a los historiales médicos.”
 California comenzó a proporcionar tabletas electrónicas gratuitas a su población carcelaria en 2021, lo que garantiza que todas las llamadas telefónicas y mensajes de texto se monitoreen digitalmente y estén listos para su análisis y búsqueda mediante inteligencia artificial. Este tipo de registros detallados ahora se pueden identificar fácilmente y poner a disposición de los comisionados de libertad condicional.
 Por ejemplo, se puede prestar más atención a cómo los presos obtienen dinero externo depositado en sus cuentas fiduciarias institucionales y cómo pagan el comedor y otros servicios. Tras la ayuda por la COVID-19 y la gran cantidad de solicitudes fraudulentas de desempleo en todo el estado, la actividad de las cuentas fiduciarias de algunos reclusos se puso en tela de juicio. Este mayor escrutinio atrajo una atención no deseada hacia otras posibles formas de mala conducta.
 Fraude de restitución
Los tribunales penales pueden ordenar grandes cantidades de restitución cuando una persona es condenada, generalmente divididas en costos judiciales y honorarios por servicios a las víctimas. A los presos que adeudan restitución siempre se les deducirá el 50% de cualquier salario o ingreso hasta que la deuda se salde. Si una persona trabaja en una cocina por $80 al mes, se queda con $40. Lo mismo ocurre si su familia le envía $200. Recibirá $100 para gastar.
 En particular, para los condenados a cadena perpetua por delitos violentos, la restitución puede ser bastante elevada y, al parecer, imposible de pagar mediante estas cuotas deducidas al 50%. Para evitar perder la mitad de su dinero, algunos presos piden a sus familiares y amigos que depositen dinero en las cuentas de otras personas que no deben restitución. Los presos acuerdan entre ellos una cuota de deducción mucho menor, generalmente del 20%, y reservan más dinero para la cantina.
 Pero estas transacciones clandestinas ahora dejan una huella digital más profunda. Los comisionados de libertad condicional quieren ver a una persona mostrar arrepentimiento y ser consciente del impacto de su delito en las víctimas. Es una mala imagen que esa misma persona participe en la evasión de la restitución para ahorrar dinero.
 “El tema de la restitución es lo único que se me ocurre para explicar realmente la disminución en la tasa de concesiones”, dijo Vanessa Nelson-Sloane, directora de Life Support Alliance, un grupo de defensa de los condenados a cadena perpetua, tanto encarcelados como excarcelados. “A veces, cuando se aprueba una nueva ley, una nueva población entra en el ciclo de libertad condicional, pero recientemente no ha habido leyes nuevas que cambien las consideraciones”.
 “Estoy tan seguro de que es así porque eso es todo lo que oigo de la gente a la que se le niega: restitución, restitución, restitución”.

Flu in North Carolina is widespread right now, and state health officials say they’ve seen a significant uptick in flu-related deaths in the first two weeks of January.
New data released Wednesday by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services shows 63 new flu-related deaths, bringing the total to 134 deaths this flu season. Last year at this time, NCDHHS reported 74 flu-related deaths.
Dr. Erica Wilson, medical director for the Medical Consultation Unit within the state’s Division of Public Health, says every flu season is a little different, and it’s unclear when North Carolina’s flu season will peak this year.
“Last year, we had a much later flu season. It didn’t really peak until February,” said Wilson. “This year, we’ve seen one very high peak already in early January.”
Last year’s flu season was also one of the worst since North Carolina began recording the number of flu deaths. The 2026 flu season could be just as deadly.
NCDHHS is encouraging people who have not had a flu shot to get vaccinated this season. Vaccines remain one of the most effective means available to prevent severe illness or hospitalization, Wilson said, and it’s not too late to get one.
“That’s the only way that we can mitigate the flu season and hopefully see fewer deaths this year than last year,” Wilson said.
A lot of North Carolinians haven’t yet heeded that advice. The state’s Respiratory Virus Surveillance Dashboard shows just 21% — roughly one in five people — have received a flu vaccine for the 2025-26 season. (For the Covid vaccine, less than 6% of the state’s eligible population has been vaccinated.)
“When we see lowering vaccination rates, we see not only the spread of flu, but recurrence of diseases that we have not seen in years, such as measles,” said Wilson.
While some critics have suggested this year’s flu shot is not very effective against the new strain of influenza A virus that’s now circulating, Wilson stressed it does offer protection.
“We often see peaks in a flu season with different types of flu. So our first peak was that new subclade K [variant], but it’s also possible that we could get a second peak that is another flu virus that may be a match to the vaccine as well,” she said
Nearly everyone ages 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine every season, according to NCDHHS.
If you’re particularly vulnerable to the flu and other respiratory viruses, health officials recommend masking if you’re in a crowded place. If you do have any flu-like symptoms, cover your cough and stay home so that you don’t spread the illness to others, they said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AdobeStock_295793977-scaled-1-1024x682.jpeg,,,2026-01-14 18:57:58.184469

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The attorney for a south Arkansas candidate for a state House seat said Wednesday that he plans to appeal a judge’s decision not to disqualify his client’s opponent from appearing on the Republican primary ballot.
John Kyle Day asked the Pulaski County Circuit Court in December to disqualify his opponent, Laura “Missy” Wardlaw, from running to represent House District 94 in the Legislature.

Day v. Wardlaw decision 
Wardlaw had been charged in 2018 with writing a hot check and had forfeited bond, which typically happens when a defendant fails to appear in court. Day had argued that amounted to a conviction, making Wardlaw ineligible to run for elected office.
Arkansas’ constitution prohibits people convicted of an “infamous crime” such as embezzlement or forgery from holding elected office. 
Circuit Judge Cathleen Compton ruled after a trial Tuesday that Wardlaw may remain on the March 3 ballot. Compton sided with Wardlaw’s attorney, who had said the candidate is eligible because she forfeited bond and didn’t plead guilty or face trial over the misdemeanor charge.
Jacob Swatley, Day’s attorney, told the Arkansas Advocate he plans to appeal the matter to the Arkansas Supreme Court. The upcoming primary election on March 3 “will be taken into consideration” in Day’s request for an appeal, Swatley said.

Landon Sanders, Wardlaw’s attorney, noted that the primary is “right around the corner” and said Wardlaw will continue to campaign while the appeal is pending.
“Her votes should be counted, they should be certified, and a bond forfeiture is not an admission of guilt,” Sanders said.
If the Arkansas Supreme Court rules before the primary that Wardlaw is disqualified from running for office, any votes cast for her in portions of Bradley, Desha and Drew counties would not be counted.

Wardlaw and Day are running for the House seat held by Wardlaw’s husband, term-limited Republican Rep. Jeff Wardlaw of Hermitage. The winner of the March primary will be unopposed in November’s general election.
Last week, Compton ruled that Casey Reed of Sheridan is ineligible to run for a House seat in parts of Grant and Saline counties because he signed a guilty plea in 2012 for a felony charge of abuse of public trust, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.
Reed had filed to run in the Republican primary to succeed Republican Rep. Julie Mayberry of Hensley, who declined to run for reelection. Two other Republicans are running in the primary, and the winner will be unopposed in November.

Water experts warn that New Mexico still needs more data and policy to address a potential ‘looming groundwater crisis’ from climate change and human use. (Diana Cervantes for Source NM)Even as water advocates praised lawmakers’ record funding proposals for aquifer mapping and other water priorities in the upcoming 2026 legislative session, a report urged the Roundhouse to do more to protect the state’s declining groundwater.
The New Mexico Groundwater Alliance, made up of water policy experts from around the state, released the 80-page report Wednesday. Groundwater accounts for more than half of New Mexico’s total supplies and about 80% of the state’s drinking water. The report builds on previous findings that the already arid state faces a shrinking supply, estimated to be 25% to 30% by 2050, from hotter temperatures and continued pumping. 
“New Mexico is at the front lines of climate change impacts, which threatens water resource availability,” the report stated. “Groundwater management is paramount to the resilience of water supplies, communities, and economies for generations to come.”
In the last several decades, the fastest-dropping groundwater levels include important agricultural and residential basins: the Ogallala aquifer near Clovis and Portales; the Mimbres Basin near Deming; Estancia Basin in east-central New Mexico; the Albuquerque Basin; and the Placitas and East Mountains areas.  
In order to address the threat of a “looming groundwater crisis,” the report requests that lawmakers and the state government map aquifers; better monitor pumping; develop technical assistance for local management; and ensure groundwater is included and understood in regional planning efforts. The report also includes for consideration groundwater management policies from around the state and neighboring Western states.
The policies don’t require New Mexico “to reinvent the wheel,” coauthor Aron Balok, superintendent of the Pecos Valley Artesian Conservancy District, said in a statement. “Many of our local communities already have the experience, knowledge and determination needed to protect our groundwater,” Balok said. “The state should look to these communities and figure out how to replicate what we know is already working.”
Already, lawmakers have proposed record funding for water priorities, including more than $22 million to map the state’s aquifers, more than double 2025’s funding of just over $7 million. 
Everyone agrees: Big data gaps remain as state explores brackish water market 

“Policymakers understand that we need sound science, data and modeling to better manage our groundwater resources and we’re ready to supply it,” said Stacy Timmons, associate director of Hydrogeology Programs at the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources, in a statement. “Building on the initial funding provided by the Legislature last session, we’re prepared to execute a long-term strategy that will close our water data gaps and modernize our antiquated systems using 21st century technology.” 
Additionally, the Legislature proposed $15 million for the River Stewardship Program for the environment department for rivers, streams and wetlands projects; and $15.5 million for the Strategic Water Reserve after changes to the program in 2025 to allow additional uses for banking water in New Mexico rivers. 
Water getting this much funding and attention at the Roundhouse is “rare but welcome,” Tricia Snyder, the rivers and water director for New Mexico Wilderness Alliance, told Source NM in a call. 
“We’re seeing the water crisis with the naked eye,” she said, referring to the summer drying of Rio Grande and continued snow drought.  “There’s challenges there that we have never experienced before, it’s becoming self-evident that we really have to figure out solutions because it only gets harder from here.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Release-21-Edited-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-14 18:57:58.184469

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)New Jersey’s congressional Democrats and Roxbury residents are decrying Trump administration plans to turn a warehouse in this Morris County town into the state’s third immigration detention center.
The lawmakers called it “unconscionable” that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security would consider building another migrant jail in New Jersey, even after an uprising and a detainee’s death at Delaney Hall, the Newark facility that opened last year. They urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons to “immediately cease” any plans for a jail in Roxbury.
Divided NJ Legislature gives final passage to three anti-ICE bills

“Immigration detention facilities in New Jersey have become notorious for inefficiency and waste in addition to humanitarian failure. These failures have inflicted trauma both on detained individuals and on surrounding families, communities and local governments who have been forced to grapple with the ongoing harms associated with immigrant detention,” they wrote in the three-page letter.
According to the Washington Post, internal ICE documents show the Trump administration is seeking contractors to turn industrial warehouses into jails to hold thousands of immigrant detainees. Roxbury is among two dozen locations across the country where officials are mulling warehouse jails.
“The proposal would subject thousands of people, the majority of whom pose no threat to public safety, to confinement under cruel and inhumane conditions. Warehouses are designed for storage and shipping, not for safely housing people,” the lawmakers’ letter reads.
They stressed that ICE detention facilities “already have a poor track record.” Thirty-two people died in ICE custody last year, making it one of the deadliest years in the agency’s history, according to groups like the American Civil Liberties Union that track in-custody deaths.
The Democrats noted in their letter that prior to Delaney Hall’s opening, they warned of the dangers of expanding immigrant detention and urged officials to reverse those plans. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement entered into a 15-year contract with prison company Geo Group to operate the 1,000-bed facility anyway, and the facility opened last spring.
Since then, Delaney Hall has been at the center of numerous controversies. Newark city officials alleged Geo Group opened it without securing the proper permits, prompting a lawsuit. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka (D) was arrested there May 9 — he was charged with trespassing, and prosecutors quickly dismissed the case — and Rep. LaMonica McIver (D) was charged with assault in connection with the melee that occurred when agents moved to detain Baraka. In June, four detainees escaped after knocking down a shoddy wall, and in December, a detainee died less than a day after arriving at the jail.
The letter from Democrats comes on the heels of Roxbury’s all-GOP council unanimously passing an ordinance that says the town is “not an appropriate municipality” for a detainee processing facility. The ordinance says township officials have not been approached or solicited by the federal government about opening the facility there.
Currently, New Jersey is home to two detention centers, Delaney Hall and Elizabeth Detention Center. A state law bars local, state, and county governments from entering into contracts with federal immigration authorities for housing migrant detainees, though private companies may still do so.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Deborah Yetter)LOUISVILLE — Large, “hyperscale” data centers are expanding rapidly in the United States and unless people are willing to give up the internet, cloud computing, navigation systems — and yes, even Netflix — communities should be planning how to locate and regulate them.
That was the consensus of a Louisville Forum panel Wednesday that met to discuss the controversial but seemingly inevitable growth of the massive centers that one panelist described as “a warehouse full of computer equipment” powering a wide range of internet services.
“Data centers are increasingly important in our country and around the world because of our reliance on the internet, cloud computing, AI,” said Cliff Ashburner, a lawyer at the Dinsmore firm who has been involved in the only one currently underway in Kentucky.
The $11 billion center is under construction on Camp Ground Road in southwest Jefferson County.
“This is a thing that is happening and I believe that Kentucky should position itself and Louisville should position itself to take advantage of it and allow for data centers to locate in our state and our community,” Ashburner said.
The one-hour forum hosted by the nonpartisan public interest group included questions from the audience about the purpose and potential impact of data centers.
Such centers have been controversial because of their size, potential noise or pollution, the huge amounts of electricity they require and fears of possible rate increases by utility companies that must expand generating capacity to serve them.
But Rob Houchens, with We Are Oldham County, and a member of Wednesday’s panel, said he’s not opposed to data centers even though his group helped organize a successful fight to block a 1.7 million square foot center proposed last year in his county.
“It’s about location, location, location,” he said, adding the proposal developers eventually dropped was too near residential areas and not far enough off the main highway. Also, Oldham County lacked adequate regulations for such developments, which officials now are close to adopting, he said.
Newly installed, industrial-sized cooling equipment for a massive data center in Loudon County, Virginia, is seen on a cold day, Jan. 21, 2025.
“That’s what we didn’t have in Oldham County,” he said, referring to pending regulations. “It caught us off guard.”
Houchens said he does not oppose a data center in Oldham County on a more suitable site.
As for electricity rate increases, panelist and utility executive John Bevington argued that’s unlikely in Kentucky.
Utilities are regulated by the state Public Service Commission and utility companies must justify plans for expansion and any rate increases, he said. And data centers would buy an enormous amount of electricity, bringing significant revenue to the power company, said Bevington, , a senior director of business and economic development for Louisville Gas & Electric and Kentucky Utilities.
“In the end, I think data centers could actually put downward pressure on rates,” Bevington said.
Power demand from data centers is straining supply for the nation’s largest power grid operator, PJM, as power rates have risen for consumers, The Wall Street Journal reported this week. PJM manages a 13-state grid that includes part of Eastern Kentucky.
Consumer advocates have warned that ratepayers could get stuck with higher bills if utilities expand capacity only to have data center plans fall through. Houchens noted that some states, including Ohio, have adopted consumer protections that add “tariffs” for data centers to make up the difference if they use less electricity than projected. 
Houchens allowed that traffic, especially during the construction phase, and pollution, could affect communities. The pollution could come largely from enormous diesel generators data centers use onsite in the event of a power outage.
In that event, “You’re going to have a great number of diesel generators operating,” he said.
But data centers can generate important revenue including property taxes Houchens acknowledged he’d like to see for Oldham County schools.
In Louisville, the data center under construction will generate about $46 million a year for Jefferson County Public Schools, about $10 million for Metro Government and $12 million for the Pleasure Ridge Park fire department, Ashburner said.
Scheduled to open in 2026, it will create about 210 jobs  — mostly internet technology and systems related — at an average salary of $112,000 a year, he said, adding most communities would view those jobs as “big wins.”
“They are very real and high-paying,” he said.
One question focused on tax incentives and whether Kentucky needs more to attract data centers. The GOP-dominated General Assembly in 2024 enacted tax breaks for centers seeking to locate in Jefferson County.
Houchens, of the Oldham County citizens group, said he doubts further tax breaks are necessary given the eagerness of developers to build data centers.
“There’s already an appetite to build them here,” he said. “I’m not sure we need any more incentives.”
As for the future of data centers in Louisville and Kentucky, panelists agreed more are likely — though mostly outside urban settings.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa lawmakers and community college leaders have found themselves on the same page about the potential benefits of offering baccalaureate degrees based on local needs, with legislation to make that potential a reality already filed.
Community Colleges for Iowa Executive Director Emily Shields, joined by Iowa Central Community College President Jesse Ulrich, Eastern Iowa Community Colleges Chancellor Bryan Renfro and Iowa Western Community College President Dan Kinney, presented to the Iowa House Higher Education Committee Wednesday on a study into community college bachelor’s degree programs.
Based on research into other states’ policies and impacts of implementation, Shields said the move into bachelor’s degrees has been seen less as a pivot away from the traditional community college mission and more as an expansion of it.
“As an expansion of the mission, what we really look at for community college baccalaureate degrees is the ability to provide local, affordable and accessible four-year degrees to folks,” Shields said.

Committee Chair Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, requested the study during last year’s legislative session and previously stated this would be one of his priorities for the 2026 session. He has also filed House Study Bill 533, which would allow community colleges to develop programs leading to a bachelor’s degree as long as they relate to job fields that “address a high-demand, sustained, and unmet workforce need within the community college region as shown by the community college” and aren’t offered entirely online.
A subcommittee meeting on HSB 533 is scheduled for Jan. 20.
Nearly half of all U.S. states already incorporate bachelor’s degrees into their community college offerings, Shields said during the meeting, with Illinois and Nebraska currently contemplating legislation to do the same. States like Florida and Washington have found success in students meeting degree requirements and in employment and wage gains.
Health care professions, business, technology and agriculture sciences are some of the most popular degree programs available nationally, she said, but in Iowa, community colleges would identify the biggest needs of the communities they serve and develop degree programs using that information.
Each of the community college leaders identified issues with access to education in their region, from being located in an “education desert” with no four-year institutions close by to dealing with a “brain drain” of students traveling elsewhere to learn.
Ulrich said currently if a student finishes their education at Iowa Central but wants to continue with their degree, their options are online-only schooling, which is not preferred for some, or leaving home, which some people cannot do and comes with extra costs and other issues.
He met one person whose child had wanted to attend Iowa Central but didn’t want to have to transfer to complete their nursing degree. Ulrich said everyone in Iowa should have the option of staying at their institution of choice to fulfill their education.
A recent regional job study from the Quad-Cities area found that there is a lack of baccalaureate degree options for working adults who want to further their career through education and training, Renfro said. Being able to offer bachelor’s degree programs at Eastern Iowa Community Colleges would open doors for both students and employers hoping to upskill workers, he said.
“Community colleges have the ability to take those two-year associate degrees that we know the information is critical and relevant to doing their job, but then building a bachelor’s degree on top of that,” Renfro said.
Kinney said during the meeting the topic of community college bachelor’s degrees came up many times in public meetings he held last year, with questions from people whose students would have chosen to stay close to home for their education if they had the chance.
In order to handle start-up costs associated with incorporating bachelor’s degrees into community college offerings, including expenses relating to faculty, facilities and more, Shields said the higher education system is requesting a grant fund totaling $20 million over five years. According to other states, it costs around $300,000 to start up a new program and there won’t be tuition yet at that point to cover expenses.
Collins said during the meeting the funding request is not included in the legislation on community college bachelor’s degrees, and Rep. Heather Matson, D-Ankeny, asked the community college leaders what their plan would be if this legislation passes, but money doesn’t follow.
Each was in agreement that, even if no state funding is available, program development will still occur, but not at the pace and capacity they could get to with startup money. Ulrich said if the legislation passes, he would still implement degree programs to combat brain drain, but the college would focus on programs with lower start-up costs like a bachelor of science in nursing program.
“I have to do … something to stop brain drain in my region, so we would start something,” Ulrich said. “It would probably have to start smaller. It’d have to probably be a more targeted area.”
Rep. Dave Jacoby, D-Coralville, brought up a concern during the meeting that these programs wouldn’t be sustainable, pointing to declining traditional student-age populations, but community college leaders stated high school students heading straight to college aren’t the main target for these bachelor’s degree programs.
Community colleges’ bachelor’s degree offerings would be aimed not at 18-year-olds hoping to live in dorms and have the traditional college experience, Shields said, but at adult learners, those who are place-bound and those who financially cannot afford a university education.
Jacoby’s point about student numbers identifies “one of the most compelling arguments to do this,” Shields said, as just educating recent high school graduates will not be enough to meet workforce needs in the state.
“We absolutely have to get people back to education, upskilling, reskilling, and this is another part of that as well,” Shields said.

(Photo by Alex Baumhardt/Oregon Capital Chronicle)President Donald Trump’s threat this week to stop federal funding to both so-called “sanctuary” cities and the states where they’re located was greeted with disbelief by many states and cities since the administration has fared poorly on that issue in court. 
“We will go to court within seconds, and we will win if he does this. It’s already proven unlawful. We’ve already won multiple times,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta told ABC News7 in San Francisco on Wednesday. 
“Those are funds that belong to the people of Chicago, not the President,” Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson said in a statement. There were similar reactions in Massachusetts and New York City.
Trump administration vows to ‘come after’ sanctuary states and cities, despite court setbacks

Trump, speaking Tuesday to the Detroit Economic Club, said he would cut off “any payments” starting Feb. 1 “to sanctuary cities or states having sanctuary cities, because they do everything possible to protect criminals at the expense of American citizens.” 
Trump was responding to those communities with policies against helping U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrest people suspected of living illegally in the United States. States and cities reacting thus far have said it would be illegal for the Trump administration to withhold all federal funding, noting that judges have made that clear in recent rulings. 
Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids and refuse some requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation, depending on the crimes involved.
There’s no universal definition of a “sanctuary city,” but the U.S. Department of Justice published a list in August that includes 12 states, the District of Columbia, four counties and 18 cities. States either listed as sanctuary by themselves or as including one of the cities were: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington. 
The Trump administration is attempting to force more cooperation with immigration arrests. But it suffered a serious court reversal last July, when a federal judge dismissed a federal sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and surrounding Cook County.










We will go to court within seconds, and we will win if he does this.


– California Attorney General Rob Bonta, Democrat


The state and local policies reflect a “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment,” U.S. District Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote. That order is now under appeal.
A California judge also issued a preliminary injunction in August stopping the Trump administration from cutting unrelated funding over sanctuary policies. The injunction covers 50 areas in 14 states. That case is also now on hold pending an appeal by the Trump administration. 
In that case, U.S. District Judge William Orrick ruled that the Trump orders to stop funding over immigration policy were “coercive” and “intended to commandeer local officials into enforcing federal immigration practices and law.”

(Stock photo by Greenleaf123/Getty Images)An administrative law judge has ruled that an Iowa school teacher committed job-related misconduct when he posted negative Facebook comments about conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
Matthew Kargol worked for the Oskaloosa Community School District as an art teacher and coach until he was fired in September 2025. Kargol then filed for unemployment benefits and the district resisted, which led to a recent hearing before Administrative Law Judge David Steen.
In his written factual findings of the case, Steen reported that on Sept. 10, 2025, Kargol had posted a comment to Facebook stating, “1 Nazi down.” That comment was posted within hours of authorities confirming Kirk had been shot and killed that day while speaking at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
When another Facebook user commented, “What a s—-y thing to say,” Kargol allegedly replied, “Yep, he was part of the problem, a Nazi.”
Steen reported that Kargol posted his comments around 5 p.m. and then deleted them within an hour. By 6 p.m., the district began fielding a number of telephone calls and text messages from members of the public, Steen found.
According to Steen’s findings, the district’s leadership team met that evening and included Kargol via telephone conference call. District leaders asked Kargol to resign, and he declined, after which the district officials said they were concerned for his safety due to the public’s reaction to his comments.
The district placed Kargol on administrative leave that evening, Steen found. The next day, district officials fielded roughly 1,500 telephone calls and received 280 voicemail messages regarding Kargol’s posts.
“These calls required the employer to redirect staff and other resources from their normal duties,” Steen stated in his ruling. “The employer also requested additional law enforcement presence at school facilities due to the possibility of physical threats, which some of the messages alluded to. The employer continued to receive numerous communications from the public for days after the post was removed.”
On Sept. 16, 2025, Superintendent Mike Fisher submitted a written recommendation to the school board to fire Kargol, with the two primary reasons cited as a disruption to the learning environment and a violation of the district’s code of ethics. Upon Fisher’s recommendation, the board fired Kargol on Sept. 17, 2025.
According to Steen’s findings, the district calculated the cost of its response to the situation was $14,332.10 – and amount that includes the wages of the regular staff who handled the phone calls and other communications.
As for the ethics-policy violation, Steen noted that the policy states that employees “are representatives of the district at all times and must model appropriate character, both on and off the worksite. This applies to material posted with personal devices and on personal websites and/or social media accounts.”
The policy goes on to say that social media posts “which diminish the professionalism” of the district may result in disciplinary action, including termination, if it is found to be disruptive to the educational environment.
The district, Steen noted, also has a policy on “employee expression” that states “the First Amendment protects a public employee’s speech when the employee is speaking as an individual citizen on a matter of public concern,” but that “even so, employee expression that has an adverse impact on district operations and/or negatively impacts an employee’s ability to perform their job for the district may still result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.”
Based on the policies and Kargol’s conduct, Steen concluded the district fired Kargol for job-related misconduct that disqualified him from collecting unemployment benefits.
The issue before him, Steen observed, wasn’t whether the district made a correct decision in firing Kargol, but whether Kargol is entitled to unemployment insurance benefits under Iowa law.
In ruling against Kargol on that issue, Steen noted Kargol was aware of district policies regarding social media use as well as work rules that specifically state employees are considered representatives of the school district at all times.
Kargol’s posts, Steen ruled, “reflected negatively on the employer and were against the employer’s interests.” The posts also “caused substantial disruption to the learning environment, causing staff at all levels to need to redirect focus and resources on the public’s response for days after the incident,” Steen stated.
Kargol’s federal lawsuit against the school district, alleging retaliation for exercising his First Amendment right to expression, is still working its way through the courts.
In that lawsuit, Kargol argues that in comments made last fall, Fisher made clear that his condemnation of Kargol’s Facebook posts “was rooted in his personal beliefs, not in evidence of disruption. Speaking as ‘a man of faith,’ Fisher expressed disappointment in the state of society and disapproval of Mr. Kargol’s expression. By invoking his personal religious identity in condemning Mr. Kargol’s speech, Fisher confirmed that his reaction was based on his own values and ideology, not on legitimate pedagogical concerns.”
The district has denied any wrongdoing in that case. A trial date has yet to be scheduled.
Several other lawsuits have been filed against their former employers by Iowa educators, a public defender and a paramedic, all of whom allege they were fired or sanctioned for online comments posted in the immediate aftermath of Kirk’s death.
Earlier this week, two Iowa teachers sued the state’s teacher-licensing board and its executive director, alleging they improperly solicited complaints related to anti-Kirk social media posts.

(Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers took final steps this week to prepare for next week’s special session to authorize the spending of federal health care money.
Congress last year created the $50 billion for Rural Health Transformation Program as a way to offset losses rural states will incur due to Medicaid cuts.
North Dakota received $199 million for the first year of the five-year grant, but is also budgeting for the additional roughly $200 million it expects for the second year.
After the Legislature approves the money, the Department of Health and Human Services will allow groups to start applying for grants. The federal government will have to review and approve every grant.
“I can’t stress enough the short timeline for funding,” Donna Aukland, the agency’s chief financial officer, told lawmakers Tuesday.
North Dakota officials celebrate being among big winners in federal rural health funding

The Legislature’s Rural Health Transformation Committee this week revisited four bill drafts to consider during the session that the state pledged to adopt in its application for the federal dollars. The federal government incentivized the policies by promising more grant money to states that enact them.
One bill would expand the prescriptive authority of pharmacists and allow them to order lab tests. Proponents of the policy say it would make it easier for North Dakotans to get treated for common conditions, especially for those in rural areas.
Under the proposal, pharmacists’ prescriptive authority would include drugs for conditions including the flu, COVID-19 and strep throat, as well as lice, cold sores, motion sickness, hypoglycemia and uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Pharmacists would also be able to prescribe the use of inhalers, nebulizers, diabetes blood sugar testing supplies and pen needles.
Additionally, pharmacists would be able to switch patients’ drugs to a substitute expected to have a similar therapeutic effect.
Sen. Kristin Roers, R-Fargo, on Tuesday said she’s concerned that this could be dangerous for sensitive groups.
“It is a fear for a lot of people, by having the language this broad it would allow for pharmacists to do therapeutic substitution for psychiatric meds for juveniles,” she said. She suggested that lawmakers should create an “exclusion list” that limit this prescriptive power in certain situations.
Roers, a nurse, also said the legislation should include more guardrails for the treatment of common diseases.
She recommended an amendment that would require pharmacists to conduct a lab test before they can prescribe medication for some conditions, including urinary tract infections.
“Without a lab test, I struggle to know how that’s uncomplicated,” Roers said. 
The committee held off on approving the amendment but indicated lawmakers will discuss it again during the special session, which begins Jan. 21.
The committee also discussed draft legislation to have the state be part of a licensure compact for physician assistants.
Lawmaker working on free school meals bill ahead of North Dakota special session

Sen. Judy Lee, R-West Fargo, called physician assistants an “extremely important part” of rural health care in the state, and said the amendment could help address workforce shortages.
Lawmakers during the session will also likely consider adopting a one-hour continuing education requirement for doctors related to healthy eating.
“We’re talking about one hour, we’re not talking about one semester,” Lee said.
Another bill draft would require North Dakota K-12 students to participate in the presidential physical fitness test.
Traynor said Tuesday that he hadn’t reviewed the bill draft with Department of Public Instruction Superintendent Levi Bachmeier but that he’s confident the agency would support it.
“From a general perspective, he is very excited about physical activity and diet in the schools,” Traynor said. 
States are guaranteed at least $500 million over five years from the Rural Health Transformation Program, but could receive up to $1 billion depending on the strength of their applications and other factors.
The $199 million awarded to North Dakota in late December is almost double the minimum funding available to states this year.
The state plans to budget $33.4 million of its award on technology, $116 million to expand health care access in rural areas, $32.2 million to address workforce issues and $17.1 million to promote healthy lifestyles.
North Dakota has until the end of September 2026 to obligate the funding, and until September 2027 to spend it.
The funding amounts to roughly $561 per North Dakota resident, according to an analysis by policy research organization KFF. Only six states received larger per-capita awards. The average grant amount was about $200 million per state.
It’s still unclear if lawmakers will allow bills on other topics to be introduced during the special session. Rep. Mike Nathe has said he’s drafting a bill related to providing school meals to all K-12 students for possible discussion. Legislative Council has drafted about 20 bills, but not all lawmakers plan to proceed with those proposals, Director John Bjornson said. The bill drafts have not been made public.
The Legislative Management committee will meet at 1 p.m. Tuesday to decide which, if any, additional bills will get introduced. Lawmakers have said they want to keep the session narrowly focused.

“I was doing my job even though it was unpopular,” said Michael Drescher, the former top federal prosecutor in the state for the last year.

MONTPELIER — Michael Drescher prosecuted cases on behalf of the federal government in Vermont during the first year of President Donald Trump’s administration —  which dealt him historic immigration cases like those of Rümeysa Öztürk and Mohsen Mahdawi. 
Now, Drescher is a nominee to serve on the Vermont Supreme Court, leading senators this week to interrogate his past. 
Gov. Phil Scott appointed Drescher to serve on the state’s top court last week, along with former top Vermont federal prosecutor Christina Nolan. Both candidates led Vermont’s U.S. Attorney’s Office under Trump, with Nolan serving in the role during his first presidential term. To serve as a state Supreme Court justice, both nominees need state Senate confirmation.

Drescher prosecuted the cases against Öztürk and Mahdawi, representing the federal government. Öztürk was a Turkish graduate student at Tufts University who was arrested in Massachusetts by plainclothes officers in March after co-writing a student newspaper op-ed critical of Israel’s war in Gaza. She was then whisked to Vermont, where she was held in an immigration office in St. Albans. 
Mahdawi was a Palestinian student activist at Columbia University who vocally opposed Israel’s war in Gaza. He was arrested in Colchester in April during a routine immigration meeting. 
Drescher resigned from his role as Vermont’s top federal prosecutor — under the title “First Assistant Attorney” — last week.
“I did that because, in order to be able to speak freely at this hearing, I think I needed to be unencumbered by being employed by the Department of Justice,” Drescher said Tuesday. 
Lawmakers in the Senate Judiciary Committee heard from Drescher again on Wednesday, grilling him about his moral compass and views on free speech. Four senators in the committee said they’ve received hundreds of emails about his appointment. 
“I still hold concerns about decisions that you made in your role,” Sen. Nader Hashim, D-Windham, the committee’s chair, said. Other senators expressed the same concern. 
What was Drescher’s defense? “I was doing my job even though it was unpopular,” he said. 
Drescher reminded senators Tuesday that Trump never formally appointed him to the role. He served as assistant U.S. attorney starting in 2002 and was promoted to the second highest position in the office in September 2023. He became the top federal prosecutor in the state last year, when the then-U.S. attorney for Vermont, who had been appointed by former President Joe Biden, resigned upon Trump’s inauguration. 
Though Drescher held the office for about a year in an acting capacity, Trump never appointed him to a permanent U.S. attorney or sought his confirmation by the U.S. Senate. Drescher also did not seek out that appointment, he said. 
Drescher said Tuesday that he found out in March his office would be prosecuting Öztürk’s case “out of the blue.” He saw the video of masked agents pulling the student into an unmarked car and described it as “irregular at least.” Drescher said he represented the federal government in the case because he didn’t want anyone else in his office to have to bear the burden. 
“I could not in good conscience subject anybody in the office to be in that position. So I concluded that if anybody was going to be fired, it was going to be me,” Drescher said Tuesday, his voice cracking with emotion. 
Drescher said he didn’t resign from his role because he thought his resignation would only prolong Öztürk’s and Mahdawi’s cases. And he would’ve violated his oath of office to not performa his due diligence in prosecuting the two immigration cases. 
Drescher’s decision-making in those two cases influenced why Scott chose him.
“The Governor was aware of Michael’s role in both of those prosecutions and believes he showed great leadership by assigning those cases to himself, rather than asking his team to take the cases,” Amanda Wheeler, the governor’s press secretary, said in an email to VTDigger. “As Michael recognized, these assignments would either put the jobs of his career staff in jeopardy or subject them to threats and abuse from members of the public.”
But for some lawmakers, Drescher’s former position is a hard pill to swallow.
“It doesn’t sit well with me,” said Sen. Tanya Vyhovsky, P/D-Chittenden Central, in an interview. 
The civil cases filed on behalf of Öztürk and Mahdawi respectively disputed the legality of their detention. In Öztürk’s case, Drescher repeatedly argued against her release from detention. 
To Vyhovsky, that shows that Drescher wasn’t just filling shoes, rather he was in practice enforcing federal immigration actions. 
Hashim, in an interview, shared the same concerns as Vyhovsky. The way Drescher handled Öztürk’s case gave him concerns about Drescher’s legal discretion, he said. 
The national political climate only increases the need for the committee to do its due diligence when considering the appointments, Vyhovsky said. And she wants to make sure that state Supreme Court justices are committed to protecting people’s rights, she said. 
Other senators expressed similar concerns in the Wednesday committee meeting. 
“I’ve never seen a crisis point in America like we’re facing,” said Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central. While Trump’s immigration agenda sweeps the country, Congress has “neutered itself” and left too much up to the judiciary, Baruth said. 
Drescher told senators he understood those concerns. But he asserted that the legal cases wouldn’t have been able to move forward without competent legal counsel on each side. 
He argued that in his former role, he was a counterbalance necessary to have a functioning legal system. And he held the executive branch to a high standard, he said. 
Drescher said that while he understands why he’s being associated with Trump’s policies and attitudes, lawyers are not usually judged based on the character of those they represent. 
Sen. Robert Norris, R-Franklin, asked Drescher if he would have done anything differently. 
“I don’t think so. I don’t think so,” Drescher replied.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong will kick off the special session of the Legislature next Wednesday with a State of the State address.
Armstrong will speak to lawmakers as they convene in Bismarck to allocate federal Rural Health Transformation Program funding, Armstrong’s office announced Wednesday.
The address will begin at 10 a.m. CT and will be livestreamed on the governor’s office website and on the legislative website.
Armstrong is expected to address his executive order that convened the special session and the federal rural health funding, awarded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as part of the One, Big Beautiful Bill Act that was signed into law in July.
North Dakota will receive at least $500 million in rural health funding over the next five years, but could receive up to $1 billion. The $199 million award for the first year of the program is about average compared to other states but is one of the largest per-capita awards in the country.

Mark Tisdel (R-Rochester Hills) encourages members of the House of Representatives to support his bill to bar K-12 students from using their phone during instruction time. Jan. 14, 2026 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceIn a push to start the year off with a potential bipartisan win, the Republican-led Michigan House has revived a piece of legislation aimed at banning cell phones in schools after a failed vote on the bill last July.
On Wednesday, the House voted 99-10 to send state Rep. Mark Tisdel (R-Rochester Hills) House Bill 4141 to the Senate for further consideration alongside Sen. Dayna Polehanki’s (D-Livonia) Senate Bill 495.
“There were a couple of bumps along the road, but you know, that’s Lansing,” Tisdel told reporters following the vote on Wednesday, saying he’d take a 99-10 vote on a piece of legislation he’d put together any day of the week.
While Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called out a cell phone ban as a priority during her 2025 State of the State Address, Tisdel’s bill did not initially receive the majority vote needed to pass through the chamber. State Sen. Dayna Polehanki (D-Livonia) put forth a similar bill with Whitmer’s blessing last year, but the policy has not advanced through the Republican-led chamber, remaining in the House Committee on Education and Workforce.
Now, Tisdel and Polehanki are moving forward on a bipartisan package with pieces in both chambers, tie-barring Tisdel’s bill to a piece of legislation from Polehanki that establishes protocol for when and how students are allowed to use cell phones in emergency situations. Both pieces of legislation will need to pass for either to take effect.
Ahead of Wednesday’s session, House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) criticized House Democrats for broadly voting against Tisdel’s policy in July, but said they were ready to start the year off on a new foot by putting the bill to another vote.
“We want our kids focused on the classroom, focused on their teachers,” Hall said. “We want them learning. We don’t want them distracted playing games on their phones, you know, messaging each other. They need to put the phones away and be focused. And unfortunately, most of these school districts don’t have the courage to deal with this locally. So we’re going to pass a law that requires them to do it.”

Hall said he looked forward to working with Whitmer to improve student literacy in the state, with Michigan ranking 44th in the nation for 4th grade reading scores. Passing a cell phone ban is part of that effort, Hall said.
“I think it’d be a great thing if before the governor’s State of the State, we can get this to her desk and she can sign it and we can put this into effect,” Hall said.
Tisdel’s bill requires schools to implement a policy banning public school students from using their smartphones during instruction time by the start of the 2026-2027 school year. Older-style basic phones would be exempt from the ban. 
That exemption stemmed from concerns on the Republican side of the aisle where students in rural areas without a bus service have extended walks or bike rides to school, Tisdel said.
“It was important that there be that kind of contact or availability,” Tisdel said. “And the beauty of a basic phone is you make a phone call or you send a text and then you put it away because there’s nothing else you can do with it.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
There are also exemptions for emergencies, medical reasons and school-related purposes. If signed into law the bill would require administrators to implement the policy in the upcoming school year, with the policy acting as a floor, allowing schools to set stricter policies if they desire.
While previous versions of Tisdel’s bill set different standards based on grade level during the school day with high school students, the version passed on Wednesday applies the same standard to all grade levels. 
While many school districts across the state already have some form of cell phone policy, implementation and enforcement is key, Tisdel said. 
“If you start to enforce and get any parental pushback, it can be very easy to just say, ‘this is not a fight we want to pick today,’ and that’s why it’s necessary for a statewide standard,” Tisdel said.
While there are no penalties for districts who do not put these policies into place, ultimately the state holds the power of the purse, Tisdel said. However, he also pointed to a survey from the National Education Association in which 90% of the members polled were in favor of a cell phone ban.

In an interview with Michigan Advance, Polehanki said she had complete faith that Michigan’s school districts would take the legislation seriously. 
Polehanki said she and Tisdel have been in agreement on how to move forward with legislation for some time; they were simply waiting for the House to move forward on Tisdel’s bill. 
While Tisdel’s bill moves to the Senate for further consideration, the upper chamber also has to consider Polehanki’s Senate Bill 495.
That bill is under consideration by the Senate Education Committee, which Polehanki chairs. It has not been taken up for a vote.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Though medical practitioners and advocates spoke against the bill, a House subcommittee moved forward Wednesday with a measure limiting minors’ ability to access vaccines related to sexually transmitted diseases without their parents’ approval.
Senate File 304 would remove the ability of minors to consent to vaccinations related to the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of sexually transmitted diseases or infections without their parent’s or guardian’s permission. It is specifically proposing a change to an existing state law that grants minors the legal ability to consent, without input from their parent, to receive medical care related to sexually transmitted diseases.
The proposed change would require parental approval for Iowans under age 18 to receive the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, as well as for the Hepatitis B vaccine. Minors could still consent to other medical care, like diagnosis or treatment of sexually transmitted diseases and infections, without parental consent.

Other vaccinations require parental consent. But the carveout for HPV and Hepatitis B vaccines was created in Iowa law to allow minors — particularly teenagers and adolescents — to access preventative care that their family may oppose for reasons including fear that approving the vaccine may signal approval of sexual activity, and concern that sexual abuse could be exposed if a minor talks to their doctor about the sexually transmitted disease.
Chaney Yeast, speaking on behalf of Blank Children’s Hospital, said parental consent and involvement in health care is always encouraged — but the current language in Iowa law was crafted to support minors in Iowa who may not be in safe home environments.
“We know that intra-familial sexual abuse is the highest type of sexual abuse amongst children, so it typically is someone they know, they love, they trust within the family,” Yeast said. “And so potentially, you have a parent that would keep them from accessing that lifesaving care of the HPV vaccine, because they’re worried about information about the abuse coming to light. So we want to make sure we’re giving kids all the tools they can access to be able to make sure (they’re) safe and healthy.”
But Bree Johnson with Informed Choice Iowa said the language in Iowa’s current law does not serve a majority of Iowa families in which parents are trying to make the best decisions for their children.
“In the end, it is the parents’ role to help determine what is right for their own child, and they are the ones who have their child’s best interests at heart,” Johnson said. “We won’t dispute that isn’t always the case, but the current law doesn’t serve the majority of parents. It is catering to a minority of instances where parents and children are or have the potential to be at odds over this issue.”
Dr. Amy Shriver, a pediatric doctor currently serving as president of the Iowa Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said getting parental consent and involvement is “already the standard of care in pediatrics,” and that doctors are not administering vaccines to young children without their guardians’ knowledge. However, she said more autonomy and discretion is given to adolescents at ages 16 and 17 on several medical decisions.
“Iowa already recognizes adolescents’ ability to receive confidential care for certain health concerns, including mental health, sexual health and substance use, because it improves safety and health outcomes,” Shriver said. “… Iowa pediatricians want to partner with families and legislators to protect kids’ health and reduce cancer in our state. Senate File 304 moves us away from established best practices in adolescent care and cancer prevention.”
Amy Campbell, representing the Iowa Nurses Association, said the measure would create an “unnecessary barrier to one of the most effective cancer prevention tools.” HPV can cause several types of genital cancer, including cervical cancer, penile cancer, anal cancer and vaginal cancer. Campbell said studies have shown the use of the HPV vaccine dramatically reduces instances of cervical cancer, especially for people vaccinated before age 17, in comparison to unvaccinated populations.
“I think it’s really important to also note that the earlier you get it, the better,” Campbell said. “You only have to have two doses of the vaccine if you do it at a younger age, versus when you get older, you have to have an additional third vaccine. It also is only really effective if it happens before sexual activity begins.”
Jackie Cale with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network said the organization was encouraged by Gov. Kim Reynolds and state lawmakers stating they want to address Iowa’s place as a state with the second-highest cancer rate and one of the fastest growing cancer rates in the country. However, she said, this bill would be “a step backwards in the fight against cancer in Iowa.”
“Even the governor yesterday mentioned cancer prevention and early detection of the state, which is fantastic to see, but this bill would directly conflict with that message,” Cale said. “So instead of looking at ways to prevent minors from having access to safe and effective forms of cancer prevention, we would encourage focusing on promoting education and awareness of the vaccine.”
The bill passed the Iowa Senate in April 2025 in a 33-14 vote, but was not taken up by the House before session ended. But as 2026 is the second year of the 91st Iowa General Assembly, legislation from the 2025 session can be brought up and considered as a continuation of the previous year’s actions.
Republican Reps. Eddie Andrews, R-Johnston, and Austin Harris, R-Moulton, supported the bill moving forward while Beth Wessel-Kroeschell, D-Ames, opposed the bill. It moves next to the full House Health and Human Services Committee.
Harris said he did not doubt the science showing the HPV vaccine’s effectiveness in cancer prevention efforts.
“To me, it’s never been about questioning the efficacy of the vaccine,” Harris said. “It’s about whether parents have ultimate control over their children’s health.”

Fourteen groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth, Planned Parenthood Great Plains, El Centro and the Sierra Club, joined forces to promote the rally. The crowd swelled to elbow-room only around the center of the floor, with dozens more demonstrating from the railings above.
Rabbi Moti Rieber, executive director of Kansas Interfaith Action, which helped organize the rally, told the crowd, “We are living in troubling times.”
“America is showing its dark underbelly,” Rieber said. “The original sins of the United States — anti-Black racism, brutal oligarchic capitalism and slaveholder Christianity — are all in power right now. The wealthy and powerful are completely protected from their criminal activity and the consequences of their actions.”
Rieber and other speakers addressed food insecurity, voting rights, climate change, health care, reproductive right, public education, and immigration enforcement — themes that also appeared on handwritten signs throughout the crowd.

Several signs referenced U.S. Immigration an Customs agent Jonathan Ross killing Renee Nicole Good in her car last week in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
“You may have been surprised that they shot a ‘normie’ white woman in the face, but when Christian nationalism sees white people standing with the ‘other,’ they see that as treason worthy of death, and that is what we are facing today,” Rieber said.
Before the speeches began, the crowd sang lines from Woody Guthrie’s “All you Fascists Bound to Lose.” Mandy Todd, a Lindsborg pastor and director of engagement and development for Kansas Interfaith Action, led a rendition of the civil rights anthem “Ain’t Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me ‘Round.”

At various times during the two-hour rally, the crowd sustained chants of “f*** ICE” and “human needs are human rights.”
Several people held signs that read: “Necesidades humans son dereschos humanos,” which is Spanish for “human needs are human rights.”
Demonstrators also carried signs that read:
“What was the $ bonus ICE got for murdering Renee??”
“Renee Nicole Good is not collateral damage.”
“Justice for Renee.”
And “Unmask and disarm ICE killers.”
One person sat on a box that read: “Salt melts ICE.”

Chris Wilson, pastor at Saint Andrew Christian Church in Olathe, held a sign reading, “The power of the people is stronger than the people in power.” He said lawmakers were too busy targeting transgender people, public education and things that “make our state better.”
“They’re spending way too much energy targeting the few versus supporting and funding things for the larger majority of people in the state,” Wilson said.
He attended the protest with Carol Nistler, of Miami County, who said she wanted to make her voice heard about “everything” and “to remind our legislators of their real job, which is to serve the people of Kansas.”
Her sign read: “Legislators: Who do you serve?”

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
Lawmakers have a new plan to overhaul Vermont’s response to homelessness, an issue that has remained stubbornly persistent in recent years even as state leaders have thrown hundreds of millions of dollars at easing the problem.
A bipartisan bill introduced last week is legislators’ latest attempt at reform. The bill would dramatically wind down Vermont’s use of motel rooms as emergency shelter over the next two years, while ramping up funding for shelters, transitional housing and related services.

It would also create a new, voluntary program dedicated to paying for travel for unhoused people in Vermont “who wish to return to their home states.” 
Rep. Eric Maguire, R-Rutland City, the bill’s lead sponsor, said his goal is to wrestle the costly motel voucher program back down to its pre-pandemic size, before an influx of federal COVID funds and worsening homelessness ballooned the program’s scale. Funding that once went to the motel program would instead get directed into creating an improved continuum of shelter and housing options, he said, including converting motels into apartments.
“Let’s get it back to where it’s temporary, and get (those) investments made into permanent settings that give people that outlet – that place to go to come out of homelessness, not remain stagnant in the circumstances that they are in,” Maguire said. 
The bill places time limits on how long individuals can remain in shelter and transitional housing (60 or 180 days, depending on the program) and sets expectations for engagement with services, something Maguire sees as critical for holding clients “accountable.” 
Outside of the Statehouse, Maguire works as the shelter director for BROC Community Action in Rutland, an overlap that he does not view as a conflict with his legislative service.
He envisions the bill as a two-year bridge to a homelessness system that’s primarily run by community-based agencies rather than the state, which had been the goal of legislation that failed last session.
The bill’s co-sponsor, Rep. Theresa Wood, D-Waterbury, said she wanted to show support for the reform effort even though she doesn’t agree with all of the details. For instance, she thinks a provision to halt the use of motel rooms in fiscal year 2028 – something that would only happen with an administrative check that enough shelter and housing exists to meet demand – isn’t practical. 
“I don’t think we can totally eliminate the use of hotels,” Wood said. “It’s not realistic.”
Still, Wood, who chairs the human services committee in the House, sees the bill as a good starting point. And her cross-aisle collaboration with Maguire has garnered praise from the administration of Republican Gov. Phil Scott, a notable achievement after Scott vetoed the reform effort Wood drove last year.
“We’re really grateful for the partnership between Reps. Wood and Maguire,” said Sandi Hoffman, interim commissioner of the Department for Children and Families. “There’s a lot of things in [the bill] that we like,” and others that need more discussion, Hoffman added, though refrained from sharing details.
The future of the motel voucher program has proven to be a political lightning rod in recent years. Scott has long pushed for its expansion to end, arguing that the program is too expensive – and ineffective – to continue on the state’s dime. Democratic leaders in the Legislature have resisted that aim, though haltingly agreed to winnow down the program’s scale over the last few years, setting restrictions that have resulted in relentless waves of evictions. 
The Agency of Human Services quietly convened a working group in December to consider the future of the motel program and the state’s homelessness response system more broadly, according to meeting documents obtained by VTDigger/Vermont Public. 
Those discussions focused in part on limiting the use of motel rooms, creating new shelters for people with complex medical needs and verifying Vermont residency before ensuring benefits, according to meeting presentations, agendas and minutes reviewed by the newsrooms.
Advocates for unhoused Vermonters have begun to register their concerns with policymakers’ direction. Brenda Siegel, director of End Homelessness Vermont, said she’s particularly concerned about a renewed focus on people from out of state using Vermont benefit programs.
But a 2024 investigation by Vermont Public/VTDigger dispelled a common narrative that Vermont’s spike in homelessness was driven by unhoused people moving to Vermont from other states. 
The bill’s dedicated program to pay for relocation of people with family connections outside of Vermont is unnecessary and stigmatizing, Siegel said.
“What it says is: We don’t want poor people here. And that is a really big problem,” she said.

The final survey is expected to be published by the end of January, according to the agency. Numbers are not expected to significantly change.

Respondents came from 200 farms across Vermont’s 14 counties, the majority from Addison, Orleans and Rutland counties. The results show 79,000 acres were impacted by the drought, a total swath roughly one and a half times the size of Grand Isle County.

Farmers faced lower crop yields and insufficient pasture for livestock, according to survey responses. They had to pay to bring in additional feed and water. Some had to sell animals such as goats and sheep early because their food stores were scarce. When asked what resources they needed, most farmers responded that they needed financial assistance. Now, agricultural advocates are again asking the legislature for that help.
“Farmers cannot continue to bear the cost of these disasters without support from the state,” Maddie Kempner, policy and organizing director at the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont, or NOFA-VT, told lawmakers in the Senate Agriculture Committee last week.
Vermont’s latest drought forces a broader reckoning with how the state prepares for – and pays for – climate-driven agricultural disasters. As lawmakers again debate whether to create a standing disaster fund for farms, the losses documented in the survey sharpen a central question for the Legislature and the public alike: can Vermont continue responding to extreme weather events ad hoc after the damage is done, or should it establish a system that protects farms before disaster hits. 
Kempner asked lawmakers to back S.60, a bill proposed last session to establish a Farm Security Fund, a permanent well of money to provide financial assistance to farmers facing losses from weather conditions such as high winds, flooding, extreme heat, abnormal freezes, fire and drought. 
The bill, first introduced by Sen. Ruth Hardy, D-Addison, was passed by the Senate last year and ended up in the House Committee on Agriculture, Food Resiliency, and Forestry, where it was expanded to include other working lands like forests. It lagged in the Appropriations Committee as the session ended. 
Removal of climate
Since then, House Appropriations added amendments to the bill that were presented to the House Agriculture Committee on Wednesday morning, including the removal of references to climate. The phrase “climate-based” was struck and replaced with the phrase “weather-based,” for example. 
“The committee asked for any reference to climate or climate change to be removed because they didn’t want to create controversy or discussion or debate on climate,” Michael O’Grady, deputy chief counsel for Vermont’s Office of Legislative Counsel, told lawmakers.
Climate change, largely caused by the burning of fossil fuels, leads to more extreme weather events like heat waves, drought, flooding and wildfires.
“Our food system is really resilient and really robust in this state, but with the amount and frequency of weather and economic challenges that farmers are facing, they’re really taking the brunt of climate change,” Eli Hersh, a farmer who runs Honey Field Farm in Norwich, said over the phone.
Lindsey Brand, marketing and communications director at NOFA-VT, said on Friday, before the amendments were added, that her organization is hoping the House will pass the bill soon, moving it closer to a law this legislative session. NOFA-VT wants a $20 million fund, which Brand said would be the minimum useful number based on average losses documented on farms over the last three years.
“The losses from the drought are really devastating,” Brand said, emphasizing the impact not only on farmers but on downstream communities. “Farmers impact their local economy so much that when they experience big losses like that because of factors outside of their control, it’s really serious.”
About a quarter of survey respondents had crop or livestock insurance, but the majority did not have access to such aid. Many farms in Vermont, which are often small and have diversified sources of income, are not covered by rainy day funds like federal crop insurance programs, according to the proposed legislation.
Hersh said that in fields without irrigation access, he struggled to get a good harvest. 
“In most other seasons, we had never gotten dry enough for some of those fields to really start showing the lack of water,” Hersh said. Drought conditions made fall cover cropping challenging, which could impact soil quality moving forward, he said.
“There really is a need for the state to support the farming community with that safety net to ensure that you don’t just lose a couple dozen farms every time there’s a bad weather year,” Hersh said. “It starts adding up in terms of who’s left to grow the food for us.” 
Sen. Russ Ingalls, R-Essex, chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, told advocates that farmers’ voices needed to be heard in the Appropriations Committee, where such disaster relief funds could be doled out by the state.
“You’ve already sold us,” Ingalls said.
Drought versus floods
The losses from the drought are similar to prior floods, according to Abbey Willard, agriculture development division director at the agency that managed the survey. The 2023 flood resulted in about $16 million in agricultural losses; the 2024 flood claimed farming losses totalling more than $15 million, she said.
These impacts build over time, according to the survey. Three-quarters of respondents were impacted by previous major weather events like floods, freezes, or wind storms, and the majority of those respondents were impacted by two or more events. 
But the impacts from the drought felt more obscured across the state than more visceral events like floods, she added.
“What’s hard and different about this drought versus the floods of 2023 or 2024 is that unless you’re growing crops or raising animals outdoors, or your industry is dependent on the climate, you may not be aware that we’re experiencing a drought in Vermont,” Willard said. “We have snow on the ground, we’re getting rain events and yet we still have agricultural businesses that don’t have enough feed for their animals.” 
Willard said a statewide disaster assistance program like the Farm Security Fund seemed reasonable, if only because it took so long for federal dollars to trickle down. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture allocated millions of dollars in block grant funding to support Vermont’s agricultural and forestry businesses impacted by the 2023 and 2024 floods, but it’s been more than a year since those funds were appropriated by Congress and they’ve yet to reach the state, Willard said.
The drought has continued into January for the eastern half of Vermont; most of Caledonia and Essex counties are still in a severe drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor housed at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. For the rest of the state, even if drought-like conditions are over, it will take time for the land to recover. 
In September, Agriculture Secretary Anson Tebbetts asked the federal government to declare a secretarial statewide disaster designation for the impacts of the ongoing drought in the state. 
By mid-January, the state had not heard back.

Free.,Trump signs law to allow whole milk in school lunches,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-signs-law-allow-whole-milk-school-lunches,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump signed a law Wednesday that will restore whole milk in federally subsidized school lunches.The dairy staple — out of school meal programs for more than a decade amid a broader push to curb childhood obesity — will soon return to school cafeterias under the law. Trump said during a signing ceremony in the Oval Office that the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act will “ensure that millions of school-aged children have access to high-quality milk as we make America healthy again.” Seated with a jug of milk on the Resolute Desk, Trump said the changes will also be “major victories for the American dairy farmers who we love and who voted for me in great numbers.” White House ceremonyAgriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins celebrated the legislation becoming law and said her department would post Wednesday the “new rulemaking that is necessary to get whole milk back into school lunches.” Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also lauded Trump’s efforts and described the measure as a “long overdue correction of the school nutrition policy that puts children’s health first.” Trump was also joined by Dr. Ben Carson, national advisor for nutrition, health, and housing at USDA, along with Democratic Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont, GOP Sens. John Boozman of Arkansas, Mike Crapo of Idaho and Roger Marshall of Kansas, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and advocates who supported the bill.Rep. Glenn “GT” Thompson of Pennsylvania, who chairs the House Agriculture Committee, and Rep. Tim Walberg of Michigan, chair of the House Committee on Education and Workforce, also attended the ceremony. The U.S. House passed the bill in December, following unanimous passage in the Senate in November. Welch and Marshall, along with Pennsylvania Sens. Dave McCormick, a Republican, and John Fetterman, a Democrat, introduced the measure in the Senate. Thompson and Democratic Rep. Kim Schrier of Washington state brought corresponding legislation in the House.What the new law does Under the law, schools that are part of the USDA’s National School Lunch Program can offer “flavored and unflavored organic or nonorganic whole, reduced-fat, low-fat, and fat-free fluid milk and lactose-free fluid milk.” The program — which provides free or low-cost lunches in public and nonprofit private schools and residential child care institutions — saw nearly 29.4 million children participate on a typical day during the 2023-2024 school year, according to the Food Research & Action Center.The schools can also provide “nondairy beverages that are nutritionally equivalent to fluid milk and meet the nutritional standards established by” the Agriculture secretary.The law exempts milk fat from being considered saturated fat as it applies to schools’ “allowable average saturated fat content of a meal.” Parents and guardians, as well as physicians, can also offer a written statement for their student to receive a nondairy milk substitute. Michael Dykes, president and CEO of the International Dairy Foods Association, celebrated the bill becoming law in a Wednesday statement.Dykes dubbed the law a “win for our children, parents, and school nutrition leaders, giving schools the flexibility to offer the flavored and unflavored milk options, across all healthy fat levels, that meet students’ needs and preference.” The signing marked the second major nutrition policy change this month. The U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released the 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which encourages more full-fat dairy and protein.",,,,2026-01-14 17:56:41.105377

(Photo: ncleg.gov screenshot)A state House committee on involuntary commitment of people with mental illnesses began after Iryna Zarutska was killed last year by a man with a long criminal history and a schizophrenia diagnosis. 
Now, another death has brought new immediacy to the committee’s work. 
At the request of Wake Co. Republican Reps. Erin Paré and Mike Schietzelt, the committee will examine the circumstances leading to the death of Ravenscroft School teacher Zoe Welsh. Ryan Camacho, who has a long criminal history and a diagnosis of schizophrenia, allegedly attacked Welsh in her Raleigh home Jan. 3 . 
Weeks before Welsh’s death, a Wake County District Court judge denied a prosecutor’s request to have Camacho involuntarily committed, even after the judge determined Camacho was incapable of proceeding to trial on a misdemeanor breaking and entering charge. 
“What additional tools would assist law enforcement and the courts in preventing horrific crimes like this from occurring in the future?” the lawmakers asked in their Jan. 6 letter, which Paré posted to X.
Rep. Hugh Blackwell (R-Burke), a committee co-chairman, said the panel will look at the circumstances surrounding Welsh’s death and determine whether their discoveries will be included in its legislative recommendations. 
Last year, the legislature passed Iryna’s Law, which, among other changes, creates new pretrial release procedures and requires judicial officers to initiate involuntary commitment proceedings in certain circumstances. 
The House Select Committee on Involuntary Commitment and Public Safety is examining the practice of forced psychiatric treatment with the goal of recommending improvements. 
Experts say that people with mental illnesses are far more likely to be crime victims than they are to commit violent crimes, but people with severe mental illness charged in several deaths in North Carolina in the last year have politicians focused on the link between mental health and public safety. 
“Despite recent occurrences, these are rare occurrences,” Dr. Marvin Swartz, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University, told the committee Wednesday. 
“Crafting a policy objective that recognizes that this happens rarely, that it’s almost a needle in a haystack to find the person that’s actually going to commit serious acts of violence, is really tough,” he said.
The committee on Wednesday focused on involuntary outpatient commitment, where civil court orders require people to receive treatment. 
It’s been effective in New York, Swartz said. However, it’s unclear how often involuntary outpatient commitment has been used in North Carolina after 2001, when government mental health offices stopped providing treatment and moved to have mental health services offered by private providers instead, he said. The state doesn’t collect that data.
Patients in outpatient commitment can’t be forced to take medications, Swartz said. But most do because it’s a court order. 
“Most patients think that they are required to take their medication, and then they do,” he said. 
Dr. Carrie Brown, chief psychiatrist at the state Department of Health and Human Services,  said involuntary outpatient treatment is suitable for a limited number of adults – those who don’t have insight into their illness, decline voluntary treatment, have repeatedly been hospitalized or arrested, or have repeatedly committed violent acts.
Dr. Carrie Brown, chief psychiatrist at NC DHHS, talks to a House committee about outpatient involuntary commitment on Jan. 14, 2026 (screenshot)
Involuntary outpatient commitment is a key to addressing the “revolving door” of repeated arrests, hospitalizations and ER visits, she said. 
However, Brown added, outpatient commitment as it operates now has a number of weaknesses, she said. Those include court orders that aren’t specific and a shortage of specialized providers. 
Initiatives aimed at helping recently incarcerated people who have mental illnesses, called FACT, or Forensic Assertive Community Teams, are launching in five locations around the state will help, she said.  
A team providing centralized statewide oversight is needed in addition to the intensive case management, Brown said. 
And judges need to know that outpatient commitment is an option. 
“If they’re faced with someone who doesn’t meet involuntary impatient criteria, but requires treatment to be safe in the community, then outpatient commitment may be appropriate,” she said. 
Some House members are focused on ways to make more beds in state psychiatric hospitals available. At least 300 beds in state hospitals remain unused because the state does not have enough staff to handle additional patients. 
“We know that everybody cannot live outside an institution,” said Rep. Donna White (R-Johnston). “They can be outside of an institution, but they cause havoc for everybody else,” she said. 
It’s the state’s responsibility to treat those patients in state hospitals, White said. She asked for ideas for adding qualified staff to state hospitals. 
Blackwell said the committee may be in a position to have some recommendations for the legislature to consider in the upcoming short session, but said lawmakers will need additional time to focus on long-term solutions.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-13-at-11.32.44-AM-e1763068717337-1024x499.png,,,2026-01-14 17:56:41.105377

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders directed an additional $10,000 Wednesday from one of Arkansas’ disaster recovery funds toward the response to the deadly storms that swept through northeast Arkansas last year.
The funding Sanders released through an executive order is on top of $380,000 already authorized by the governor since tornadoes killed three people during the severe weather on March 14 and 15.
Fifteen tornadoes touched down during the storms, including what the National Weather Service described as an “exceptionally rare” long-tracked EF-3 twister. That particular tornado ravaged Cave City and was the cause of the three deaths in the state from the storms, all in Independence County.
Over 150 homes were destroyed in the March storms, with 93 more sustaining major damage, according to a preliminary damage assessment prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Just over $377,000 of the $380,000 authorized from the governor’s disaster response and recovery fund for the March storms has been spent, according to Arkansas Division of Emergency Management spokesperson Ashley Luningham.
The state’s emergency management director, A.J. Gary, will have the discretion to spend the funds on “defraying program and administrative costs,” according to the order.
The March 15 storm was one of several that tore through northeast Arkansas and the rest of the state last spring. Less than a month later, the state was inundated with rainfall that caused“generational” flooding, according to the weather service.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Arden Barnes)FRANKFORT — Kentuckians who have finished treatment for organ cancers and melanoma, among others, no longer need to wait more than a year to donate blood at the Kentucky Blood Center, the organization announced Wednesday. 
According to the American Cancer Society, people who have had Kaposi sarcoma or a blood cancer like leukemia, lymphoma or multiple myeloma will never be able to donate blood. 
People who have had “most other” cancers can usually donate if treatment has been complete for 12 months and during that 12 months, there were no signs of recurrence, according to the American Cancer Society. 
Dr. Dennis Williams, the medical director at Kentucky Blood Center, said in a press release from the organization that there is “no evidence that cancers are transmitted by blood transfusion.” 
“While there are certain cancers and treatments that will still impact donation, we are excited to offer a wider opportunity for those who wish to give blood to do so,” Williams said.
It’s difficult to determine how many newly eligible donors this could apply to, according to center spokesman Eric Lindsey. 
Several hundred people who were in the system on deferral because of their cancer status have been notified that they are now eligible, he said. Many more could be now eligible and were never in the system.

He also sees other content that he recognizes as fake, making him feel the need for a “clear borderline” between what’s real and what’s AI. 
“I feel like AI is improving and becoming realistic every day, day by day,” Moon told state lawmakers Wednesday. “Because people are facing AI more often, people have to clearly know this is AI.” 
Reining in artificial intelligence is a key goal for Washington state lawmakers this year. But ideas about how to do so are drawing pushback from the tech industry and could set the state up for a clash with the federal government.
State lawmakers are considering bills requiring AI detection tools and disclosures to address deepfakes and to establish new safeguards for children using the technology.  
They’re hoping the legislation will add guardrails for AI chatbots like ChatGPT, protect users from discrimination in algorithms, address the use of AI in school discipline decisions, and require union talks over government use of the burgeoning technology.
A state House panel considered three of the measures Wednesday. 
State regulation of AI has been a sticking point for the Trump administration. President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month threatening federal broadband funding for states if the federal government believes they’ve passed “onerous AI laws.” 
Trump believes the federal government should set regulations, instead of a patchwork of states. But there are no signs federal lawmakers will approve comprehensive AI regulations in the near-term.
The Legislature created a task force dedicated to devising potential legislation on AI in 2024.
Deepfakes
Moon was testifying Wednesday in support of House Bill 1170. The legislation would require generative AI companies with over 1 million users to make an AI detection tool available. 
It also pushes these companies to disclose, such as through a watermark, that an image, video or audio recording was AI-generated. 
The tech industry opposes the legislation. Amy Harris, director of government affairs for the Washington Technology Industry Association, said it’s not as simple as watermarking the content, since those can be removed. 
“There’s no single reliable way today to detect AI content across formats,” Harris added. 
The House Technology, Economic Development and Veterans Committee is set to vote on the legislation Thursday. Last year, the panel passed the bill along party lines, but it didn’t make it to the House floor.
Jai Jaisimha, co-founder of the Transparency Coalition, told the committee Wednesday that “things have only been worse” since lawmakers considered the legislation last year.
Chatbots
House Bill 2225 responds to cases of young people who shared their ideation for self-harm with AI chatbots that, in some cases, reportedly gave them ways to die by suicide.
OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, reported in October that more than a million users each week indicate “explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.” Roughly 560,000 show “possible signs of mental health emergencies.” The platform has hundreds of millions of users. 
The company faces lawsuits from families of children who killed themselves after engaging with the chatbot companion. OpenAI says it has worked with mental health professionals to improve the platform.
Washington’s legislation sets requirements for the operators of these tools when dealing with minors. These systems include ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Copilot and Google’s Gemini.
If the operator knows a user is a minor, it must inform them that the chatbot is artificially generated and not human. It also must implement “reasonable measures” to prevent the chatbot from generating sexually explicit content or suggestive dialogue. And it prohibits “manipulative engagement techniques” that try to intensify an emotional relationship between the user and the bot. 
“We know this is happening,” said prime sponsor Rep. Lisa Callan, D-Issaquah. “It’s happening for emotional manipulation, becoming your best friend, talking and supporting everything that you’re saying that’s making you feel good. The dangers are there.”
Katie Davis, co-director of the University of Washington Center for Digital Youth, confirmed teens go to these chatbots for more than help with schoolwork, sometimes seeking support for romantic issues and exploring their identity.
Companies with these chatbots must also implement protocols for addressing suicidal ideation, including by referring users to crisis resources and preventing responses that describe self-harm. 
Violations of the policy would be enforced under the state’s Consumer Protection Act. This mechanism, which would allow individuals to sue, drew ire from the tech community. Harris said it would expose companies to “sweeping liability.”
“This approach risks reducing access to helpful tools without meaningfully improving safety,” she said. “We support targeted safeguards for truly high-risk uses, and urge the committee to pause and work with us further on this.”
The bill would take effect Jan. 1, 2027, if passed.
The legislation is modeled to an extent on a law in California that took effect this month. New York has also passed regulations on this issue.
Gov. Bob Ferguson requested the bill. Beau Perschbacher, senior policy advisor to the governor, said that when he talks to his boss about AI, the governor references his own teenage children and “the challenges of parents today with trying to keep up with rapidly evolving technology.”
“It will put us at the forefront of regulating AI companion chatbots,” Perschbacher said.
AI discrimination
Another bill focuses on the use of AI-fed algorithms in high-stakes decisions, like hiring and medical insurance. 
House Bill 2157 would require both the companies developing and deploying the technology to take steps to protect people from discrimination potentially embedded in the algorithms. The bill covers businesses making over $100,000 in annual revenue.
Other potential issues mentioned in the bill where this could come up are school admissions, housing and loans. 
“In the absence of federal guidelines and regulations, state oversight is essential,” said bill sponsor Rep. Cindy Ryu, D-Shoreline.
Ryu’s bill doesn’t cover spellcheck, calculators, robocall filters, antivirus technology and more benign applications. Governments are exempt from the requirements.
Business groups said the measure could have a chilling effect that pushes companies to stop using the technology entirely.
The legislation is based on a Virginia bill passed last year but vetoed by the state’s Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.

Colorado led the nation when it approved legislation focused on high-risk AI, but implementation has been delayed. 
The state attorney general’s office supports the bill, but would prefer to enforce the law instead of a private right of action allowing lawsuits brought directly by members of the public. Ryu said she considered that alternative, but it would be too expensive in the state’s difficult budget environment. Instead, it doesn’t provide for financial damages stemming from lawsuits, only court-ordered relief to stop the discrimination.
“This was the best I could, we could do,” Ryu said. “So this is essentially a start, is what I’m thinking.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/future-is-AI-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-14 17:56:41.105377

(Photo by GracedBytheLight/Getty Images)OKLAHOMA CITY – Oklahoma has reached a settlement with one of the poultry companies it successfully sued over pollution in the Illinois River Watershed.
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond on Wednesday announced the settlement with George’s, Inc.
George’s, Inc., a company headquartered in Springdale, Arkansas, committed to remove poultry litter from the watershed over seven years and reduce the remaining amount.
The company agreed to pay $5 million to the state for remediation and conservation projects and attorney fees. It will also pay a special master $250,000 to monitor compliance.
The company also agreed that poultry litter removed from the watershed will not be applied to land in any other nutrient-sensitive watersheds in Oklahoma.
In exchange, the state released all claims against the company.

“This settlement demonstrates that fair, good-faith negotiations can produce outcomes that serve everyone’s interests – protecting Oklahoma’s water resources while respecting the economic realities facing our agricultural partners,” Drummond said. “George’s willingness to come to the table and work toward meaningful remediation, rather than prolonged litigation, reflects the kind of responsible corporate citizenship I hope to see from all parties in this case.” 
George’s could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
Last month, a federal judge issued a judgment holding seven large poultry companies jointly responsible and requiring them to pay for decades of cleanup along the Illinois River Watershed. The judge also imposed strict restrictions on poultry waste application.
The settlement announced Wednesday does not affect ongoing proceedings with the other defendants: Tyson, Cobb Vantress, Cargill, Simmons, Peterson Farms and Cal-Maine.
“I remain committed to working with all parties to achieve comprehensive solutions for the Illinois River Watershed while preserving the economic vitality of Oklahoma’s  poultry producers,” Drummond said. 
In 2005, former Oklahoma Attorney General Drew Edmondson sued the companies, alleging the excessive spreading of poultry litter as fertilizer had degraded the watershed, which runs through Eastern Oklahoma and the Northwest Ozark Mountains in Arkansas.
Edmondson said Wednesday that George’s should be entitled to a break because they were the first to settle, which deserves an incentive.
“There is a significant amount they are going to pay in for restoration of the watershed and there is also an amount that they are going to pay toward a special master,” Edmondson said. “Those are good things.”
But Edmondson said he is concerned that the company will be able to walk away after seven years, unless that time frame is extended by mutual consent.
“I find that a little dangerous,” Edmondson said.
Edmondson said George’s settlement should incentivize the other companies to settle, “but I’ll be surprised if it does.”
The settlement only affects one grower, said Gov. Kevin Stitt, adding that he is concerned for all of the others.

He said he was renewing his call for Drummond to seek a stay from the federal court order and continue settlement discussions that include his Secretary of Agriculture and Secretary of Environment.
Edmondson said a map of the impacted area shows that it is nutrient impaired or nutrient sensitive.
“There’s unusual algae growth,” Edmondson said. “The biosphere of the water has been changed. The fish that can survive are different.”
It is no longer as attractive of a watershed as it was in the past, Edmondson said.
The poultry industry has become a “sacred chicken,” rather than a sacred cow, he said.
“Legislatively and administratively, we have violated our own act, we the people, by allowing that to happen,” Edmondson said. “And the worst player in the watershed has been poultry.”

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)For three seconds on the floor of a Ford Motor Co. plant in Dearborn, a solitary autoworker did what the political establishment has largely failed to do for three months: remind the country exactly who its president is.
As Michigan Advance reported, when Donald Trump walked through the  facility Tuesday, a worker in a now-viral video shouted that Trump was a “pedophile protector,” a reference to the president’s long-running ties to Jeffrey Epstein and the still-unresolved question of why the full Epstein files have not been released. 
Trump’s response wasn’t denial, reflection or restraint. He flipped off that Ford employee, since identified as 40-year-old TJ Sabula, a line worker and member of UAW Local 600.
That moment — crude, unpresidential and unmistakable — cut through weeks of both-sides noise and strategic silence. In one exchange, the country saw the same man it has seen for nearly a decade: thin-skinned, angry at accountability, and hostile to anyone who challenges him, especially working people.
A Ford worker called out Trump. The president flipped him off. Now, he’s been suspended.

And then Sabula was suspended.
U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit), whose district includes many Ford workers, confirmed what Ford itself would not say publicly: Sabula was suspended immediately after the incident. 
Tlaib didn’t mince words about what that decision said.
She expressed shock that Ford would punish a worker for stating something “factually true,” while saying nothing about a president who responded by flipping off one of their own employees. 
“He’s the president of the United States and he did that,” Tlaib told me in a phone interview Tuesday night. “But they say nothing, and they punish him for speaking up … for survivors.”
That’s the part that should linger. This wasn’t just a heckle. Sabula’s comment went to the heart of a question that refuses to go away: why Trump’s Department of Justice has failed to follow the law and fully release the Epstein files, and why so many powerful people seem determined to let the issue fade.
Tlaib made that connection explicit, noting that the Epstein matter has slipped from headlines even as survivors and advocates continue asking when they’ll get justice.

There certainly has been a lot to be distracted by, whether it’s the killing of an unarmed mother of three in Minneapolis, a military incursion into Venezuela to depose its leader or threats to invade a staunch NATO ally’s territory.
But Sabula wasn’t distracted.
That’s what makes this moment so damning. For months, Republicans have tiptoed around Epstein, issuing vague statements about “process” and “transparency,” while refusing to say plainly what millions of Americans already believe: that Trump’s DOJ is obstructing accountability, and that the failure to release the files protects powerful men, not survivors.
Instead, it took an autoworker, with no press staff, pollsters or protective bubble, to say it out loud, at personal cost.
In doing so, Sabula exposed more than Trump’s ingrained cruelty. He exposed Ford’s priorities.
As Tlaib pointed out, Ford planned the visit, brought Trump onto the factory floor and failed to give workers a heads-up. They placed employees in a volatile situation with a deeply divisive president and then acted shocked when someone exercised their First Amendment rights.
Ford could have hosted Trump at headquarters. They could have limited his access. They could have coordinated with the UAW, which Tlaib noted has historically been involved in presidential visits but notably was not part of this one. 
Instead, they made a choice, and then punished the worker who bore the consequences.
That choice sends a message. As Tlaib put it, it tells workers that standing up for sexual assault survivors is a firable offense, while accommodating power is corporate policy. It suggests a company more concerned with pleasing a president than protecting the people who build its cars.
It also reveals how normalized Trump’s behavior has become. A president flipping off a factory worker should be a national scandal. Instead, the fallout landed almost entirely on the person without power.
This is why those three seconds mattered.
They cut through the noise and reminded us that Trump, as well as his administration, still treats accountability as a personal insult. But it also means that institutions — from the DOJ to Fortune 500 companies — still bend to protect him.
Tlaib hopes the public will protect Sabula, noting the real risks he now faces for speaking out. She’s right. 
We shouldn’t let a factory worker carry alone what should be a collective demand: release the Epstein files, follow the law, and stop punishing truth-tellers to appease an angry president.
For three seconds, America was reminded who Donald Trump is. 
And it took a union member and working stiff to do it.

Mike Parson to fund voter-approved Medicaid expansion  (Tessa Weinberg/Missouri Independent).A milestone moment for the Missouri state budget passed unmentioned Wednesday in a House committee — for the first time since Medicaid expansion was passed by voters in 2020, the general revenue fund is being tapped to pay for it.
In the four years that the voter-mandated program has been set aside in a separate line item, lawmakers have appropriated $13.5 billion and the number of people covered has grown to more than 363,000. Until Gov. Mike Kehoe presented his budget this week, there was never a request to use general revenue — money from income and sales taxes — for the program.
Instead, federal COVID aid, plus money from taxes on medical providers, has paid the state’s 10% share.
The money for eligibility expansion is part of the $1.1 billion supplemental spending request for the overall Medicaid program. The number of people served by the expansion program has been growing, and it will take $79.9 million of general revenue — matched by $409 million in federal funding — to finish out the fiscal year, according to Kehoe’s budget request.
No one on the 31-member House Budget Committee questioned or commented on the request during a hearing on Kehoe’s $3.3 billion supplemental spending plan for all of state government. Kehoe is asking for $572 million in general revenue in that total.
Lawmakers are being asked to send the bill to Kehoe’s desk by March 15 — far earlier than normal — because there is a federal grant for the upcoming FIFA World Cup in Kansas City that must be spent within 45 days of being received.
The money is not in the state’s hands yet but it is expected by the end of the month.

That the general revenue request for Medicaid expansion drew no questions is evidence that the program — which majority Republicans funded in 2021 only after an order from the Missouri Supreme Court — has worked for the state, said state Rep. Betsy Fogle of Springfield, ranking Democrat on the budget committee.
“​​When you look at increased access to health care, increased access to hospital and primary care clinics across the state, I think Medicaid expansion has been a positive for Missourians,” Fogle said. 
The entire additional cost for Medicaid to complete the year drew only one question during the hearing.
“The question is, are these in line with what we’ve seen in previous supplementals, or are any of these spikes that should raise an eyebrow,” asked state Rep. Del Taylor, a Democrat from St. Louis.
The request is similar to past years, state Budget Director Dan Haug said. Part of it is because lawmakers lowball the overall cost of the program each year to help lower the overall budget total, he said.
“Some of it is some increased cost, as we’ve seen in other lines, like our health care costs for our state employees,” Haug said. “Medical costs just are going up in various areas around the country, not just in Medicaid programs, but in private pay.”
Under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the federal government pays 90% of the cost of coverage for adults from 18 to 64 with incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty level. That is about $21,600 for a single person.
Expansion in Missouri occurred during the federal health emergency for COVID-19, when the state was receiving extra federal funds for Medicaid because no one on the program could be removed. In 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act, the signature COVD recovery bill under President Joe Biden, boosted Missouri’s federal Medicaid funding because it enacted expansion.
Missouri banked those funds and, along with funds generated from taxes on medical providers, has paid its share of Medicaid expansion.
The federal budget reconciliation act, called the Big Beautiful Bill by President Donald Trump, will bring changes to the expansion program, including work requirements and more frequent eligibility reviews. The supplemental spending plan includes $131 million — with $9 million in general revenue — to implement changes to Medicaid expansion and other social welfare programs.
The funding will be used to rewrite application systems and provide additional services to prevent errors in eligibility determinations that could cost the state. In the coming year Missouri will have to take on half the cost of administering the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP or food stamps.
And depending on the error rate for eligibility determinations for SNAP, the state may have to pay a share of the cost for food benefits themselves.
“These are the rules of the game now, and we just have to play by them and do the best we can to maximize the revenue coming down to Missouri, or minimize the error rates so that we don’t get the penalties, and that’s what we’re trying to do,” Haug said to explain the appropriation.
Fogle said she was disappointed Haug could not estimate the cost to taxpayers if error rates are not reduced.
“Those are hundreds, hundreds of millions of dollars of consequences,” Fogle said.
The supplemental spending bill’s other big items are $916 million in various line items, most of it federal funding, to pay for recovery from disasters like the May 16 tornado in St. Louis, and nearly $640 million to provide a full year of funding to the Missouri Department of Transportation.
Lawmakers tried to separate federal road aid into its own fund last year following a court decision that all money in the state road fund “stands appropriated” and can be spent by the Highways and Transportation Commission as needed. The legislation for a separate fund didn’t pass, but the spending bills for the year did not reflect that.
State Rep. Don Mayhew, a Republican from Crocker, said he’s inclined to deny the supplemental request.
“Theoretically they can go and pay this bill, if I read the decision correctly,” Mayhew said. “I would like to see that happen, to see if they truly are ‘stand appropriated.’”
Haug said the money was requested because it keeps state budgeting cleaner.
“If you want to take this out and see what happens, that is your prerogative,” he said “We would like to see it appropriated.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_0319-scaled-e1768427427848-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-14 17:56:41.105377

Maura Healey’s attempts to lower energy costs.","MASSACHUSETTS ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATORS are delaying implementation of a clean heat program until 2028, according to a note the Healey administration quietly sent to stakeholders in late December, just days before the regulation was set to take effect. 
The clean heat standard, which the Baker administration initiated in 2021, is designed to incentivize fuel suppliers and the thermal sector to adopt cleaner heating technologies like electric heat pumps to cut emissions and meet the state’s aggressive climate commitments. The standards were supposed to kick in this year. 
The oil, propane, and natural gas providers would need to gradually cut their emissions each year under the program and buy credits to offset their pollution. Those costs in theory could be passed on to consumers, risking further price increases that would run counter to Gov. Maura Healey’s attempts to lower soaring energy costs as she seeks reelection this year. 
“Governor Healey is focused on lowering energy costs,” Karissa Hand, a Healey spokesperson, said in a statement.” That’s why we went straight to the public to get their thoughts on the implementation of the Clean Heat Standard. We heard a clear desire to take additional time to implement these changes, let the market develop, and keep costs down.” 
The memo, sent to “stakeholders” on Dec. 23, 2025, said that the administration is “working to ensure there is a robust market for affordable clean heat” and that the state will be evaluating additional data around fuel and emissions trends and heat pump adoptions. The Boston Herald was first to report on the delay. 
The clean heat standard is a key part of the state’s overall climate strategy and was expected to take effect this year. The Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2025 and 2030, which was released in 2022, evaluated five different clean heat scenarios to identify “the most cost-effective way to meet statutory GHG emissions limits.” 
Healey’s Republican opponents are already calling out the delay. Mike Kennealy, a GOP gubernatorial candidate, said Wednesday that “when you know a policy is so damaging that you have to hide it from voters, it’s clear you’re putting politics ahead of people.” Brian Shortsleeve, another Republican candidate vying to replace Healey, said the governor’s delay is the “latest cynical political ploy designed to get her through the next election.”
Last year, Healey also delayed a sales requirement for electric vehicles. And the state has had to push back offshore wind procurements as the Trump administration undermines new development in that sector.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Gov-Healey-meets-the-press-Gov-Flickr-feed.jpg?fit=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-14 17:56:41.105377

(USDA/FPAC photo by Preston Keres)A new western Montana program is looking to improve mental health for farmers and ranchers through a federal grant.
The program, “Better Together: A Wellness Series for Farmers and Ranchers,” comprises four interactive sessions focusing on stress management, mindfulness as well as strategies for navigating uncertainty in agricultural life.
Farmer and rancher mental health is a major issue within the agricultural community and according to the National Rural Health Association, the suicide rate among farmers is three-and-a-half times the rate of the general population.
“Farmers and ranchers are incredibly resilient, but resilience does not mean going it alone,” Sarah Holden, horticulture extension agent with MSU Extension in Missoula County, said in a press release. “This federal grant allows us to offer practical, evidence-based tools and create a supportive space where producers can connect, build skills and strengthen their well-being.”
The initiative is grant-funded through the Western Regional Agricultural Stress Assistance Program, part of a larger, nationwide initiative to improve rural mental health. The money for the initiative was originally part of the 2018 Farm Bill, which agricultural organizations across the country have asked to be renewed.
Montana State University Extension is one of the lead agencies for the western regional stress assistance program, which is administered by the federal government through the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The program held its first session on Jan. 12 and will host three more on Jan. 26, Feb. 9 and Feb. 23 from 6 to 8 p.m. at the Balsamroot Conference Room of the Exploration Center, located at 1075 South Ave. W. in Missoula
Local farmers and ranchers are encouraged to attend, even if they did not go to the first session, and can register online. The event is free and open to ranchers and farmers in Lake, Sanders, Mineral, Missoula and Ravalli counties, as well as surrounding areas, a press release said.
The workshops are being taught by Julie Engh Peters, with Deeproots Montana. Peters also is the co-owner of Red Hen Farm and Orchard in Missoula County.
“This work is deeply meaningful — and deeply demanding,” Peters said in a press release. “We are offering this series as an act of gratitude and support for farmers and ranchers who give so much of themselves to their land and communities. Participants will leave with tangible practices they can realistically use in daily life.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/52100786614_9103ba001a_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-14 17:56:41.105377

(Photo by Meghan O'Brien/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — South Dakota will expand a specialty program for people facing drug charges, a move spurred by a decision last year to lessen the penalties for drug use.
The state will also pilot a program meant to keep a closer eye on people serving probation sentences, South Dakota Supreme Court Chief Justice Steven Jensen said Wednesday during his State of the Judiciary message to lawmakers.
Until last year’s vote to change it, South Dakota’s ingestion law was the only one in the nation to explicitly allow felony penalties for drug use alone. Since the new law took effect in July, first- and second-offense ingestion of a controlled substance is a misdemeanor, punishable by jail time and a fine.

 Listen to Searchlight reporter Meghan O’Brien’s audio story about the State of the Judiciary address. (Broadcasters: Scroll to the bottom of this story for downloadable scripts and audio.)
The law change directed the court system to lean on the HOPE program as an option for monitoring people charged with drug use in the state. Under the terms of that program, which originated in Hawaii, participants call a number each day to find out if they’ll need to take a drug test. Those who fail to come when called or fail their test are jailed.
At the time Gov. Larry Rhoden signed the bill into law, however, South Dakota had used the program sparingly, and only for people facing felony charges. 
The state’s court system is “in the process of expanding HOPE probation to misdemeanor cases,” Jensen told lawmakers. 
The Unified Judicial System does not intend to ask for additional funds from lawmakers just yet, Jensen said, although the expansion will require oversight at the state level. 
Lawmakers approve rollback of South Dakota’s uniquely severe drug ingestion penalties

It will also require buy-in from county leaders, who would administer the program. 
Currently, all but a handful of South Dakota’s 66 counties use the 24-7 sobriety program, which typically asks participants to prove their sobriety with daily breath tests for alcohol or thrice-weekly tests for drug use.
Separately, the state has specialty drug courts, which aim to help addicted people who’ve pleaded guilty to felony charges stay sober through incentives and weekly, support-group style meet-ups with judges and the court’s other participants.
“HOPE probation has the most potential in rural counties, where monitoring services such as 24-7 and specialty courts are scarce,” Jensen said.
Sen. Tamara Grove, R-Lower Brule, was the sponsor of last year’s ingestion bill. She said after the speech that she was pleased to hear the chief justice commit to expanding HOPE probation.
“The reason why I even brought the bill was because of what he said on the floor about the success of drug courts in general,” Grove said. “I worked a lot with those in Lower Brule, so I had a passion for that.”
Pre-trial supervision
The issue of pre-trial probation more broadly is the focus of a pilot program in Pennington County, Jensen said.
Currently, the courts have no authority to “provide services” to people who haven’t been convicted or pleaded guilty to a crime, Jensen said. That could mean helping judges set the conditions for release for a person jailed as they await trial, or monitoring a person who’s been released as they await trial to make sure they’re behaving as their bond conditions dictate and that they show up for court dates.
The pilot program in Pennington County to allow for pre-trial supervision in the Rapid City area will be paid for by grant funds.

“We will report to the Governor’s Office and the Legislature on our progress and hope to expand these services statewide in the future,” Jensen said.
Lawmakers will need to authorize the pilot program by passing a court system-sponsored bill that awaits a hearing in the House of Representatives.
The state also aims to train court service officers on the best ways to deal with offenders between 18 and 25 years of age, and to work with partners to expand youth mentoring programs for people in that age group.
“Research shows that brain development continues through the early- to mid-20s, meaning young adults often think, learn, and respond more impulsively than older adults,” Jensen said.
The training and expansion of mentoring will help the courts, he added, “implement tailored supervision techniques to improve outcomes for emerging adults.”
Indigent legal services
Another area where Jensen said lawmakers might one day be asked to pitch in additional funding involves legal aid for those who can’t afford it.
South Dakota leans on counties to shoulder the financial burden of court-appointed attorneys in criminal cases. Last year, lawmakers approved funding for a state public defender’s office, which handles appeals in criminal and abuse and neglect cases.
New state public defense office has taken 43 cases so far

That office has improved efficiencies in the court system, Jensen said, and removed some of the financial strain from counties. 
The next step will be state intervention on the front-end of criminal cases. A state Commission on Indigent Legal Services has concluded that training for defense attorneys through the state public defender’s office, higher compensation rates and the creation of regional public defenders offices to handle “high-level felony cases” in the counties would reduce potential errors upfront and improve the system as a whole.
“A system that is efficient and effective, while also accessible in both rural and urban counties, is essential to ensure the rights the courts must uphold,” Jensen said.
The Legislature needn’t take any action this year, he said, as the commission works to “solidify the plans for future expansion for another year.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Recovery grants will soon become available to help Providence East Side businesses impacted during the roughly five-day manhunt for the gunman responsible for killing two students and injuring nine others at Brown University in December.
State and city grants enhanced by matching funds from Brown are making $45,000 available to three merchant associations whose members operate in areas surrounding the Ivy League campus, city officials announced Monday.
The campus is embedded in a residential area dotted with hotspots of commercial and retail activity. The popular shopping and dining destination Thayer Street is adjacent to where the Dec. 13 shooting took place at Brown’s Barus & Holley building.
The Thayer District Merchant Association, the Wickenden Area Merchant Association and the Wayland Square Merchants Association are the recipients. Contributing $15,000 each are the city of Providence, Rhode Island Commerce and Brown.
“Many of our local businesses felt the impact of this tragedy in numerous ways, including a dramatic reduction in foot traffic just before Christmas,” Smiley said in a statement. “The City’s investment is aimed at supporting our small businesses and neighborhood commercial districts during a difficult moment.”
The police presence and general unease on College Hill led to business owners reporting disruptions and reduced business. The grants are meant to “help merchants recover, retain customers and keep these corridors active and resilient,” according to Smiley’s statement.  
In her statement, Brown President Christina H. Paxson said that neighboring businesses and residents aided the campus community and “provided crucial help” in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, which killed two Brown students and injured nine others.  
“We are forever grateful for their support,” Paxson wrote. “The merchants in these commercial districts play a tremendous role in sustaining a thriving local community that generations of Brown community members know and love, and we appreciate the opportunity to match these grants as one way to express our gratitude.”

Proposed changes to how the state funds its eight public universities could harm historically Black institutions, some lawmakers said.
The funding formula updates, which legislators discussed with higher education officials in December, would tie state money to post-graduation student success such as the number of Mississippians attaining jobs and completing some form of education beyond high school. 
A delegation of Black lawmakers said that factoring graduation rates, post-graduation employment and degrees awarded by universities into their allotted funding would unfairly penalize historically Black colleges and universities for challenges tied to decades of underfunding. 
Black lawmakers spoke about the funding formula to a standing-room-only crowd of more than 160 alumni and supporters at Mt. Nebo Baptist Church in Jackson on Monday. The goal of the event, organized by Jackson Democrats Sen. Sollie Norwood and Rep. Grace Butler Washington was to educate and warn HBCU stakeholders about proposals the state Legislature is considering this session. 
It was also a rally to encourage supporters to stay engaged.
“We need to be cautious as we proceed forward,” said Rep. Bryant Clark, a Democrat from Pickens and a 1998 graduate of Mississippi Valley State. 
The Board of Trustees for the Institutions of Higher Learning, which oversee the state’s public universities,  uses a formula that equally distributes funding across the eight universities without factoring in performance or enrollment. 
HBCUs serve many students who lack resources and face more barriers to completing higher education. More than three quarters of the undergraduate student body at Mississippi’s three public HBCUs rely on Pell Grants — federal student aid provided to students who demonstrate exceptional financial need — to attend. By comparison, Pell Grant recipients make up about half of the student enrollment at only two of the state’s predominantly white institutions  — Mississippi University for Women (56%) and University of Southern Mississippi (52%). 
Mississippi settled a lawsuit over funding disparities at its public universities in 2002  —  the $500 million Ayers settlement — but chronic underfunding of higher education by the state means these funds have not caught HBCUs up to their PWI counterparts.

The proposed funding formula success metrics could lead to closing Mississippi Valley State, Clark said. 
Valley State’s average six-year graduation rate is 27%, the lowest of Mississippi’s public institutions, according to IHL data. MVSU awarded 242 degrees in the 2023-24 academic year, the lowest among the state’s public universities, even similarly sized ones. Of almost 2,200 students enrolled at MVSU in fall of 2023, 985 received Pell Grants, federal financial aid awarded to students from low income households, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. 
Students who attend Mississippi Valley State have more barriers to get to the rural campus, including transportation, cost and affordability, Clark said. It is unfair for the Legislature and IHL to consider a funding formula that doesn’t take into account the disproportionate challenges to graduation that the students enrolled face, he said. 
Mississippi Valley State is also an “economic engine” for the Delta region, Clark said. The university contributes $75 million to the the state’s economy and produces more than 980 jobs, according to a 2024 HBCU Impact report from the United Negro College Fund. 
Instead of focusing on closing them, the Legislature and IHL should view the state’s HBCUs as a model of efficiency, doing more with fewer resources, Clark said. “We continue to educate our students at just a fraction of the cost.”
Alcorn State University and Mississippi Valley State alumni tend to remain Mississippi residents and enter the state’s workforce after graduation, said Rep. Greg Holloway, a Democrat from Hazlehurst. For predominantly white institutions such as the University of Mississippi or Mississippi State University, he said, “you can’t say the same thing.” 
“They don’t talk about us and our impact,” Holloway said to thunderous applause. “This new formula is about a money grab. Displacing resources from one place to another. We should be talking about how to provide quality education for our HBCU students. We deserve more.” 
Students should pay attention to the threat of closing one of Mississippi’s HBCUs, said Camrynn Wimberly, a senior studying political science at Jackson State. Wimberly rallied a few of her classmates to attend the town hall. She shares policy issues and information on her social media. 
“Our schools, we’re more than just football, partying and pledging fraternities and sororities,” Wimberly said. “We’re history.” 
At the end of the event, Rep. Zakiya Summers, a Democrat from Jackson, encouraged HBCU alumni to send emails, call and pressure lawmakers to pay attention to their concerns. Summers also led a call and response chant, and participating lawmakers and audience members locked arms. 
“When we fight,” Summers shouted into the microphone. The audience shouted back, “We win!”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/14093326/IMG_7826.jpg,,,2026-01-14 17:56:41.105377

A Dec. 17, 2025 windstorm ripped the roof off the building, causing asbestos material to spread around the area. (Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montanan).PARK CITY — Park City Public Schools Superintendent Dave Whitesell didn’t get much of a holiday break before Christmas and New Year’s.
On Dec. 17, less than an hour before classes were dismissed on that Wednesday, a wind gust of 82 mph ripped part of the roof off the district’s gym. To complicate matters, part of the debris that went along with sustained 67-mph wind gusts was firewall material, likely installed when the building was constructed in 1951, contained vermiculite asbestos.
Since then, the school district and more than a half-dozen different agencies, along with contractors, have been fixing the roof and abating the toxic building material.
The Park City School District faced a host of problems, ranging from repairing the roof, to getting information about asbestos abatement during the holidays, and even planning for classes. Whitesell said even though testing results didn’t positively confirm asbestos until after the holidays, the district took precautions and treated the materials as if they were contaminated.
Elementary grades from kindergarten through third grade have been spread out around four different locations in town, Whitesell said. Students in higher grades have been utilizing remote online learning.
“The community has just been fantastic about this because there’s been a lot of unknowns and there still are a couple,” he said. “It did take a lot of dialing and phone calls, but once we got to the right people, it all worked out.”
Whitesell told the Daily Montanan that he was hopeful that elementary students could return to in-class teaching by the beginning of next week, but that still depends on getting clearance from the Environmental Protection Agency and the state’s Department of Environmental Quality.
When older students might return is less clear.
Health officials are concerned that the area around the school — and even around the community — may be contaminated and need asbestos abatement. Officials from the EPA are still conducting tests in the area. He said DEQ officials are going door-to-door and they’re testing to make sure asbestos has not contaminated the area.
Asbestos is mineral that is used in insulation, flooring, fireproofing and some landscaping. It is extremely light and usually doesn’t present a danger when left undisturbed. But when tiny pieces of the material become airborne, humans can breath the microscopic fibers which become trapped in the lungs, which can lead to a multitude of chronic health problems including cancer, emphysema and asbestosis.
Whitesell said that school officials have restored the interior of the buildings, but don’t want to open them back up and risk recontamination from the public until public health officials tell the district the community is safe. That could take weeks, Whitesell said — the timeline depends on what they find.
He also said that officials with the federal government, Gov. Greg Gianforte’s office and leaders from the Montana Office of Public Instruction, which oversees public education in the state, have been very helpful. For example, Whitesell said that OPI officials have been a great support ensuring the students and teachers could quickly establish remote learning, not so unlike the COVID-19 outbreak six years ago.
As of Tuesday, Park City Public Schools had racked up $1.5 million in costs between the new gymnasium roof and asbestos testing and abatement. Whitesell said that will likely be picked up in some part by the district’s insurance carrier, but it’s unclear what the total costs will be and if there is other state or federal money available.
The Daily Montanan sent questions to Gianforte’s office about support, but received no comment.
Whitesell also said officials with the regional Federal Emergency Management Agency have pledged to work on a federal presidential declaration that would help open support to the small school district, which has 171 students.
He praised the community for being patient and willing to help to make sure school wasn’t too badly interrupted — amazing because the incident happened just as families were getting ready to celebrate the holidays.
  Stillwater County’s role 

As school district officials were still waiting back for test results and details about the clean-up process, the three-member Stillwater County Board of Commissioners sent the district a letter on Jan. 8, which gave the schools an ultimatum: Either clean-up the vermiculite asbestos from the surrounding areas, including the streets or the county would do it and charge the bill to the schools.
The letter gave the district until 5 p.m., on Jan. 12.
“Upon legal consultation and due diligence of legal responsibility it is the decision of the Stillwater County Board of Commissioners that the source of the asbestos is from the Park City School District and therefore ownership of any vermiculite material that has been distributed on property including the streets and sidewalks belonging to Stillwater County is also that of the Park City School District,” the letter begins.
In a response letter, sent on the county-imposed deadline of Jan. 12 and published on the district’s website, Whitesell outlined the steps the district was taking to remediate the area, and called into question the commission’s deadline. Instead, Whitesell said the process, including clean-up, was being informed by information supplied by the DEQ, not by the county.
“I don’t think their take on that was correct,” Whitesell said. “We found that kind of offensive that they expected us to be cleared in four days.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Asbestos-remediation-Park-City-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-14 16:57:14.696244

Jody Barrett says he will oppose a plan backed by Gov. Bill Lee to expand the number of private school vouchers handed out. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Plans to substantially expand the size of Tennessee’s private-school voucher program in 2026 will meet resistance from rural lawmakers, mainly because of the high cost.
Republican Reps. Jody Barrett of Dickson and Todd Warner of Chapel Hill told the Lookout Wednesday they plan to oppose proposals to increase the number of vouchers awarded through the “Education Freedom Scholarship” program, which could push the expense to nearly $300 million. Republican Rep. Monty Fritts, a Kingston lawmaker running for governor, also opposes private-school vouchers.
“One of the main pillars to my objection against the program last year was the financial and fiscal conservative concerns about funding the program,” Barrett said Wednesday. “So unless there’s some pot of money out there that they haven’t disclosed to us yet that will fund this program and cover its costs, I just don’t see how we’re going to avoid stepping off into a black hole if we keep doing this.”
Barrett is sponsoring House Bill 1544, which would require the state to provide lawmakers with a full report on the private-school voucher program, including the number of students already enrolled in private schools.
Some 20,000 students received $7,300 to enroll in private schools this year.

Lawmakers such as House Speaker Cameron Sexton want to double the program’s size after the Department of Education turned down 22,000 other applicants because the program reached its cap.
Gov. Bill Lee wants to increase the number of vouchers, as well, but lawmakers won’t know the details until he makes his State of the State address Feb. 2.
The law allows 5,000 more students to be added in the second year. But Barrett said even that is subject to the legislature approving the funding for more students, a move that could put a damper on the $144 million program. Passage during a 2025 special session came with a $430 million total cost, including money for one-time teacher raises, funds to offset losses to public school districts and expenses for administration.
Warner, an outspoken critic of the plan in 2025, called it a “scam from day one.”
He said figures would show an estimated 70% of the vouchers dished out this year went to students already enrolled in private schools, if the state would reveal those numbers. The Department of Education has declined to release the number of “scholarships” given to private-school students, saying it wasn’t required in the legislation.
“I think our leadership makes a bad mistake running this type of bill in election year because they’re gonna get these rural Republicans, these rural conservatives where there’s no private schools, they’re gonna get ’em primaried, and it’s already happening,” Warner said. 
In contrast, Republican Rep. Dennis Powers of Jacksboro said he will support a major expansion if the state has the money to back it.
“Simply because we want to give everybody the opportunity to do it because we have 22,000 people that didn’t get to do it that applied for it,” said Powers, who has a primary challenger even though he backs the program.
Powers added that any exodus of students from public schools could give districts a break from overcrowded classrooms.

A recent report by Comptroller Jason Mumpower didn’t do much to improve the outlook for voucher expansion, Barrett said.
The audit of Tennessee’s Education Savings Account program, which is limited to low-income students in Memphis, Metro Nashville and Chattanooga showed participation at only 3,693 students this year, well below the 5,000 maximum, and that most of them left high-performing schools to get the $9,400 in state funds.
The report also showed that students in the program aren’t performing as well as their peers in public schools in both academic achievement and growth in test scores.
Only students in Memphis performed better than their peers in public schools and only slightly.
If lawmakers do anything, Barrett said, they should merge the two programs and put income limits on all vouchers to make sure they go to lower income students. The “scholarship” program is split between all students and those at 300% of the federal poverty level.
Sexton wants to drop income limits on the programs to offer the funds to all students. He also said the application deadline should line up with private school schedules and that fraud controls suggested by the comptroller should be enacted.

(Courtesy of Save the Bay)More than 100 days after state coastal regulators verbally agreed to crack down on Quidnessett Country Club for failing to remove a rock wall from its shoreline, they’re backing up their words with legal action.
The Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC) filed a counterclaim against the North Kingstown country club in Providence County Superior Court Tuesday. It wants a judge to force the country club to remove the 600-foot stone wall built without permission roughly three years ago. The 17-page filing was submitted in response to one of three lawsuits the country club has filed against the coastal panel in the ongoing dispute over how to restore the shoreline of its property — and whether the wall even needs to be taken down.
The country club initially built the buffer to shield the 14th hole of its signature golf course from coastal erosion, defying state coastal rules that prohibit permanent structures in environmentally sensitive areas. After being caught by state regulators in August 2023, the country club initially sought retroactive permission by arguing for less stringent environmental regulations in the area. 
The politically appointed coastal panel denied the request in January 2024, setting off a debate over how Quidnessett should remove the wall and return the shoreline to its preexisting conditions. All seven plans submitted by Quidnessett were rejected by CRMC staff because they failed to meet coastal requirements.
During the back-and-forth with coastal regulators, Quidnessett turned to the courts, with a trio of lawsuits alleging procedural violations and challenging the legitimacy of the agency’s shoreline restoration requirements.
The country club’s most recent complaint, filed Oct. 23 in Providence County Superior Court, asked a judge to reverse the CRMC’s enforcement order, contending that the dispute should be referred to an administrative hearing officer under the agency’s own guidelines, while labeling coastal regulators’ conditions for the location and slope of a natural barrier to replace the rock wall as “arbitrary and capricious.” 
The agency in its counterclaim denied these allegations, instead pointing to Quidnessett’s defiance despite an escalating series of written and verbal warnings and threats of fines.
“QCC has quibbled with CRMC over how the property should be restored and ignored a CRMC order requiring QCC to restore the property,” the counterclaim, filed by Anthony DeSisto, the CRMC’s legal counsel, states. 
The counterclaim also warns of “irreparable harms” to the coastal marsh habitat and public access if the wall is not removed. It seeks general injunctive relief from the court to force Quidnessett to remove the wall and restore the shoreline. 
Attorneys for the CRMC also plan to seek a faster, temporary court order via a second submission for a preliminary injunction, Mark Hartmann, another attorney for the CRMC, said during the agency’s meeting Tuesday. The preliminary injunction request had not been filed as of Wednesday.
Robin Main, an attorney representing Quidnessett, declined to comment when reached by email Wednesday.
Jed Thorp, advocacy coordinator for Save the Bay, was skeptical the wall would come down any time soon. Although the CRMC has asked the court to order Quidnessett to remove the wall, its plea for for urgency is weakened by the fact that three years have passed since the wall was built.
Also unresolved: Quidnessett’s original legal argument that the dispute is best resolved by a CRMC hearing officer. 
“Is a judge going to make them take the wall down when the court hasn’t yet ruled on whether it needs to go to a hearing officer?” Thorp said in an interview Wednesday. “With that question outstanding, I don’t see this being resolved quickly.”
Thorp maintained that the CRMC waited too long to take action, ignoring the recommendations of its own expert staff and mounting pressure by Save the Bay.
Yet Thorp credited Save the Bay’s Dec. 10 email to coastal regulators, urging the council to “end its delay game,” and a Jan. 12 ecoRI News story for prompting the CRMC to finally take legal action.
“My guess is, they knew they had a meeting coming up, they saw that ecoRI article and our letter admonishing them and said, ‘we better get on this,’” Thorp said.
Laura Dwyer, a spokesperson for the CRMC, did not return requests for comment Wednesday.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Virginia House Democrats wasted little time flexing their new majority on the opening day of the 2026 General Assembly, pushing through four proposed constitutional amendments Wednesday aimed at reshaping some of the state’s most consequential political and civil rights debates — including one that would allow lawmakers to redraw Virginia’s congressional map mid-decade.
The measures, approved after clearing the House Privileges and Elections Committee earlier in the day, seek to protect abortion rights, restore voting rights for people with felony convictions, remove a defunct ban on same-sex marriage and — most controversially — grant the General Assembly limited authority to modify congressional districts outside the traditional 10-year redistricting cycle.
All four amendments now head to the Senate, where Democrats also hold the majority.
House Democratic leaders framed the aggressive opening-day push as a response to recent national court rulings, partisan redistricting battles in other states and what they described as an urgent need to let voters — not politicians or courts — decide the future of fundamental rights.
 Redistricting amendment draws fire

The most politically charged of the four measures is House Joint Resolution 4, a proposed constitutional amendment that would create a narrow, temporary exception allowing the General Assembly to redraw one or more congressional districts outside the standard decennial cycle under specific circumstances.
Under the proposal, lawmakers could act if another state redraws its congressional map mid-decade for reasons other than complying with a state or federal court order. The authority would apply only to congressional districts — not state legislative lines — and would expire in 2030.
Democrats argue the amendment is necessary to counter aggressive Republican gerrymanders elsewhere that could tilt control of Congress, while Republicans call it a blatant power grab that undermines Virginia voters’ 2020 decision to create an independent redistricting commission.
“This amendment creates essentially a narrow, temporary exception,” said Del. Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, the measure’s sponsor. He emphasized repeatedly that the proposal does not automatically redraw any lines and does not eliminate the Virginia Redistricting Commission.
“We are not expanding the authority to change the state district lines,” Willett said. “We’re just talking about congressional lines. And more importantly, it does not change any of the lines as they exist today — this just creates the process to consider doing that.”
 April special election timeline

If the amendment ultimately passes the Senate this session, it would be placed on the ballot during a special statewide election in April, rather than waiting until November — a compressed timeline that Democrats say reflects the urgency of ongoing redistricting fights across the country.
“​​We’re going to focus on today so we’ll get that out of the House and the Senate,” said Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, chair of the House Privileges and Elections Committee, during a news conference Wednesday morning. 
“And then we are looking at a special election for a statewide referendum to have the voters have their say in potentially April. And then once that kicks in, if the voters were to give us that power, we would then be looking at a modified schedule for the primaries, and then our November elections will happen as scheduled.”
Republicans have warned that the move could open the door to dramatic changes in Virginia’s congressional delegation. Democratic leaders have openly discussed the possibility of drawing a map that would yield as many as 10 Democratic-leaning districts, leaving just one Republican-friendly seat anchored in Southwest Virginia.
House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, rejected that characterization of the state.
“We’re not a 10-1 state, we’re not a 9-2 state,” Kilgore told reporters Wednesday morning. “We’re a close, 6-5 state, and some of those congressional seats are very competitive.”
Republicans have also tried — unsuccessfully — to stop the amendment in court.
A judge in Tazewell County on Tuesday rejected an emergency request from GOP lawmakers seeking to halt the General Assembly from advancing the proposal before the session began. In his ruling, the judge emphasized that courts cannot interfere with the constitutional amendment process while it is still underway.
“Plaintiffs’ motion at its core requests the Court to invade the province of the Legislature prior to the final actions of the Legislature,” the judge wrote, citing long-standing separation-of-powers principles.
The court also rejected an attempt to bypass legislative immunity by targeting legislative clerks, finding they were simply performing their official duties.
 Sharp debate in committee

During Tuesday’s committee debate, Republicans warned the amendment reverses reforms voters approved just four years ago.
“We’re using this ‘end justifies the means’ method,” said Del. Israel O’Quinn, R-Washington. He argued that the amendment was improperly introduced after the 2025 election season had already begun and pointed to social media posts showing potential maps.
“It concerns me that we’re attempting to go back to the battle days of gerrymandering,” O’Quinn said.
Democrats countered that the amendment preserves flexibility without mandating any outcome and ultimately leaves the decision to voters.
“This does not change any of the lines as they exist today, this just creates the process to consider doing that, but it does not mandate that these lines be changed,” Willett said. 
 Other amendments headed for November

While the redistricting proposal is expected to dominate debate this spring, the other three amendments are slated to appear on November’s ballot.
One would remove a 2006 ban on same-sex marriage from Virginia’s constitution — language that has been unenforceable since the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2015 ruling but remains on the books. 
Supporters say the amendment is a safeguard should the court revisit marriage equality, something Justice Clarence Thomas suggested after the court overturned federal abortion protections.
Another amendment would automatically restore voting rights to people with felony convictions who have completed their sentences. Virginia is one of the few states where former felons permanently lose voting rights unless restored by the governor, a process critics say lacks transparency.
The third and most divisive proposal would enshrine reproductive rights in the state constitution. 
It advanced last year amid emotional floor debates, shouting and a call of “out of order” in the Senate chamber, and has only moved forward because of Democratic control. 
Every Republican lawmaker has opposed the abortion amendment, and GOP leaders have previously backed near-total bans or a 15-week limit without exceptions for fetal anomalies. 
Since the fall of federal protections, Virginia has become the only Southern state without extensive abortion restrictions, leading to a surge in out-of-state patients seeking care.
Like the redistricting amendment, final approval of all three measures would rest with voters.
Price said the package of amendments reflects how interconnected the issues before lawmakers have become, particularly amid recent actions by President Donald Trump and Republican-controlled legislatures across the country. 
“‘There is no such thing as a single issue struggle,’” she said, referencing a quote from civil rights activist Audrey Lorde. “We do not lead single-issue lives, and I feel like that is more true today, now than ever in my lifetime, because of the actions of Trump and Republican-led state legislatures.”

(Photo from the CDC)Hundreds of federal employees at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) received an email Tuesday notifying them they’re no longer subject to layoffs announced last spring.
That includes roughly 100 employees at the Pittsburgh Mining Research Division (PMRD) in Allegheny County, who are focused on advancements in mine safety. Their work includes research into ventilation, blast shields, and dust reduction. While they do not create rules or regulations, technology they’ve helped develop is used in mines across the country, and their research has led to changes in mine safety standards.
“This has been a tough battle here,” said Lilas Soukup, president of the local chapter of the federal employees union that represents PMRD employees. “I think we’re finally coming to a true win.”

Roughly 90% of NIOSH employees, including the Pittsburgh mining research team, were placed on administrative leave last April and told their positions were being eliminated. The move was part of the Department of Government Efficiency’s (DOGE) effort to slash federal employment across government agencies.
But due to a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, they were not allowed to be let go. That left NIOSH employees, including those at the Bruceton facility, in a sort of limbo.

The short email employees received by NIOSH employees Tuesday offered a sense of security that had been absent for much of the last year. However, PMRD employees have yet to hear details such as when they are expected to return.
“The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health is a small but vital federal agency that helps prevent employee injuries, illnesses, and deaths at workplaces nationwide,” AFGE National President Everett Kelley said in a statement Wednesday. “The administration’s attempt to lay off nearly every NIOSH worker was shameful and illegal, considering that much of NIOSH’s work is required by law. As the union representing these dedicated public servants, we are grateful that their jobs have been restored and we will continue fighting to ensure NIOSH has the resources and support it needs to serve the American public.”
Since the announcement of the layoffs in April, 2025, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have pressured Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to reinstate NIOSH’s mine safety teams, especially as the Trump administration called for increasing mining across the country.
Pennsylvania’s Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Jessica Shirley had also urged Kennedy to reinstate the Allegheny County team, which collaborates with the state department’s Bureau of Mine Safety on work like training mine rescue teams.
“This moment belongs to every single person who refused to stay silent,” Micah Niemeier-Walsh, Vice President of a federal employees union chapter representing NIOSH workers in Cincinnati, said in a statement. “Every rally, every media interview, every petition signature, every act of solidarity by NIOSH employees and our partners in the labor movement led to this victory of saving NIOSH.”
Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Resources, said, “Under Secretary Kennedy’s leadership, the nation’s critical public health functions remain intact and effective. The Trump Administration is committed to protecting essential services—whether it’s supporting coal miners and firefighters through NIOSH, safeguarding public health through lead prevention, or researching and tracking the most prevalent communicable diseases. Enhancing the health and well-being of all Americans remains our top priority.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CDC-lab-Pitt.jpg,,,2026-01-14 16:57:14.696244

(Photo from the City of Tampa)A proposal to boost affordable housing by allowing what are known as accessory dwelling units (ADUs) — including in-law suites, garage apartments, and backyard cottages — in areas usually restricted to single-family homes is being debated again in the Florida Legislature.
The measure (SB 48) is sponsored by Sen. Don Gaetz, R-Crestview. Under existing law, local governments are authorized — but not required — to enact such ordinances. The bill would require cities and counties to authorize the units by Dec. 1.
The proposal passed unanimously in the Senate Committee on Transportation, Tourism, and Economic Development on Wednesday.
Samantha Padgett, general counsel to the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association, spoke up in support of the bill. She said that adding ADUs to the available housing stock would benefit those who work in the hotel and restaurant industries.
She added, however, that it was crucial that those ADUs “be preserved for long-term rental solutions,” applauding a provision in the legislation to ban the renting or leasing of an accessory dwelling unit for less than one month.
“Those are one of the things that will preserve accessory dwelling units to be a solution for rental for employees in the service industry,” she said.
Gaetz added an amendment deleting language allowing landlords to accept a “reusable tenant screening report” prepared by a consumer reporting agency when deciding whether to accept a potential tenant — which states such as California, Washington, Maryland, Wisconsin, and New York use. These forms allow participants to avoid having to fill out multiple applications.
He said he was removing that language “due to the danger of unauthorized sharing and hacking of personal, identifying data.”
Florida cities such as Gainesville, Tampa, Orlando, and St. Petersburg already allow ADUs.
The Florida Homebuilders Association, the James Madison Institute, the Florida Realtors, and the Florida Chamber of Commerce support the legislation.
The measure now moves to the Rules Committee, its final stop before going to the full Senate for consideration.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Imagine starting the new year with the promise of at least a $147 million payout from the federal government.
But there are strings attached.
In late December, President Donald Trump’s administration announced how much all 50 states would get under its new Rural Health Transformation Program, assigning them to use the money to fix systemic problems that leave rural Americans without access to good health care. Now, the clock is ticking.
Within eight months, states must submit revised budgets, begin spending, and show the money is going to good use. Federal officials will begin reviewing state progress in late summer and announce 2027 funding levels by the end of October.
The money — divided into unique allocations for each state, ranging from $147 million for New Jersey to $281 million for Texas — represents the first $10 billion installment from the five-year, $50 billion program. Congress created the fund as a last-minute sweetener in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act last summer to offset the outsize fallout anticipated in rural communities from the statute’s nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid spending cuts over the next decade.
Federal officials crafted the fund to give states “space to be creative,” Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said on a call with reporters after announcing the funding Dec. 29. “Some states will fail, and we will learn from that.”
The money was divided according to a complicated formula.
In 2026, each state will receive an equal $100 million share under the law for the first half of the money, plus additional funding from the second half. Oz’s staff steered payouts from the second portion based on each state’s rural score, as well as results from a “technical” scoring system for project proposals.
Within hours of the announcement, academics and researchers began to parse the awards to better understand why some states received more than others, including whether the awards reflected any partisanship or political favoritism.
At first glance, total awards do not appear to favor states governed by either Republicans or Democrats. But one academic data analysis teased out the amount awarded for each state’s technical score, which is the part determined by the discretion of agency officials.
The analysis was performed at the University of North Carolina’s Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, which specializes in rural health. A KFF Health News review of the Sheps Center data found that states with Republican governors tended to receive more money for the parts of their application based on the technical score. Democratic-controlled states crowded the bottom quarter of those technical score awards.
Overall, though, the state awards reveal wild variation in how much money each state will get per rural resident, almost a hundredfold difference between the top and bottom.
In an emailed statement to The Arizona Republic, a spokesperson for Arizona’s Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs accused the administration of shortchanging rural residents in the state, which was awarded $167 million this year from the program.
CMS spokesperson Chris Krepich said in an emailed statement to KFF Health News that “politics played no role in funding decisions.”
On the December call, Oz pushed states to start working on policy actions championed by the administration — such as approving presidential fitness tests and restricting food benefits — that could require legislative approval.
Half of states promised to mandate the presidential fitness test, Oz said. Many states also proposed food waivers under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, which would limit low-nutrition items such as soda. He also said some states promised to teach health care professionals about nutrition. And others confirmed they will repeal certificate-of-need laws, which require companies to prove that new health facilities they want to open are necessary.
Krepich said CMS’ new Office of Rural Health Transformation is hiring program officers to serve as point people for three or four states. Many states are setting up their own offices to oversee the new funding.
Oz highlighted Alabama’s “big maternity initiative with robotics doing ultrasounds” and said states are tackling issues ranging from behavioral health to obesity.
A KFF Health News review of state “project abstracts” and “spotlights” released by CMS shows that many states plan to address the workforce challenges in rural areas. Delaware, for example, plans to use its funding to create the state’s first four-year medical school with a rural primary care track.
A third of states said they want to improve electronic health records, and every state mentioned telehealth.
Many state legislatures must pass laws to distribute the funding to their state offices. Meanwhile, state officials are hiring staff, organizing advisory committees, and preparing to dole out money.
“I’m excited about what’s next,” said Terry Scoggin, former interim chief executive of the Texas Organization of Rural & Community Hospitals, or TORCH. Texas was awarded the biggest allocation. The money will bolster a rural hospital funding bill Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed last year, Scoggin said.
More than two dozen cash-strapped rural hospitals in Texas have closed or been converted to clinics since 2005, a nationwide trend that hit the Lone Star State particularly hard. The state has the largest rural population in the United States. Texas’ allocation amounts to about $66 per rural resident, according to a KFF policy analysis. By contrast, Rhode Island was granted about $6,300 per rural resident.
Scoggin said he has “a ton of concerns” about companies taking the money instead of it helping rural hospitals and residents. “I was blown away about how many for-profit companies reached out.” The companies have also called rural hospitals and asked to work with them to apply for state money, he said.
The awards should be judged on how they benefit rural residents because “the stated goal of the program is to improve rural health,” said Paula Chatterjee, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania who co-authored a Senate Finance Committee memo on the transformation fund.
Researchers at the Sheps Center conducted the analysis to estimate how much money states received from the technical score, which is the portion of funding based on the quality of their proposals and state policy actions that align with “Make America Healthy Again” priorities.
New Mexico won the least amount of technical funding, with less than 10% of its award based on the discretionary metrics. Alaska won the largest technical award, according to the Sheps Center data.
Texas, Nebraska, New Hampshire, and Hawaii rounded out the top five recipients of technical funding. In addition to New Mexico, the other lowest technical awards went to Michigan, New Jersey, Arizona, and California.
Mark Holmes, director of the Sheps Center, declined to comment on whether he saw any political bias in the awards but said the nuance in the final portion of discretionary awards based on technical scores is important because those dollars can be redistributed and potentially clawed back in future years.
“We can be fairly certain that every state will get at least a slightly, if not a vastly, different amount next year based on this re-pooling and reallocation piece,” Holmes said.
States now have a limited time to show they’re using the money effectively to secure future funding.
But they can’t start spending yet. CMS followed standard grant procedures and is requiring each state to submit revised budgets before they can draw down money, Krepich said.
States have until Jan. 30 to resubmit their budgets, and CMS then has 30 days to respond, according to the standard Notice of Award. Under that timing, some states may not have cash in hand until March.
“CMS is working closely with states to complete this process as efficiently as possible,” Krepich said.

Delmarva Power seeking third base-rate increase in roughly five years
WILMINGTON, Del. — Delmarva Power has asked state regulators to approve a new electric rate increase that would raise base-rate revenue by $67.8 million, a move that consumer advocates and some lawmakers say comes at a difficult time for Delaware families already facing higher utility bills.
The request, filed with the Delaware Public Service Commission, would increase the fixed monthly customer charge from $13.50 to $15.94 and allow interim rates to take effect as early as July 9, 2026, while the case is under review.
If approved, it would mark Delmarva’s third base-rate increase in roughly five years, bringing total requested increases over that period to about $160 million.
Delmarva says the increase is necessary to recover the cost of major infrastructure investments and to fund new programs aimed at improving reliability and helping customers better manage electricity usage. Critics argue the timing raises serious affordability concerns as supply, capacity, and fuel costs continue to rise.
Utility cites infrastructure and reliability
Delmarva reports it has invested about $480 million in Delaware’s electric system since its last rate review, focusing on storm hardening, grid modernization, and reliability upgrades. The company says those investments have contributed to a 47% reduction in outages statewide over the past decade.
The utility is also proposing new “load-flexibility” and affordability programs designed to encourage customers to reduce usage during peak demand periods. Delmarva estimates participating households could save $60 to $100 per year, with total customer benefits projected at roughly $13 million.
About $23.2 million of the request reflects costs already being collected through a temporary infrastructure surcharge. Delmarva is seeking to roll that surcharge into permanent base rates.
Critics warn of cumulative impact
Public Advocate Jameson Tweedie has sharply criticized the proposal, calling it a “non-starter” during what he describes as an affordability crisis for many households.
Tweedie has raised concerns about the cumulative impact of repeated rate cases, Delmarva’s requested 10.5% return on equity, and the growing gap between utility investment plans and what customers can reasonably afford.
Senate President Pro Tempore Dave Sokola has also questioned the request, noting that many families were hit with unexpectedly high winter electric bills last year.
What this means for your bill
If approved, the increase would affect base rates — the portion of electric bills that covers Delmarva’s infrastructure and operations, not the cost of electricity supply.


Typical non-heating residential customersUsing about 810–830 kilowatt-hours per month would see base-rate increases of approximately $6.40 to $9.30 per month.


Electric space-heating customersCould see increases of about $15.60 per month.


These estimates do not include higher supply prices, regional capacity charges, or fuel costs, which have already contributed to rising electric bills across the region.
Delmarva is also seeking approval for interim rates beginning July 9, 2026. Any additional charges collected under interim rates would be refunded if regulators ultimately deny or reduce the increase.
What happens next
The rate request now enters a formal review process before the Delaware Public Service Commission, including testimony, public hearings, and analysis by commission staff and consumer advocates. A final decision is expected late in 2026.
The case sets up a familiar debate for regulators: how to balance long-term investments in grid reliability and resiliency with short-term affordability for customers already under financial pressure.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Delmarva_Retouched-5931.jpg,,,2026-01-14 16:57:14.696244

 Kempthorne honored due to service and ‘lifetime support of the U.S. military’

Risch said in the press release that he spoke to USS Idaho Cmdr. C.J. Guillerault in December, and made the naming request to “acknowledge Kempthorne’s significant contributions to this project as well as a lifetime of support to the U.S. military.” 
Risch highlighted Kempthorne’s work as a member of the Senate Armed Services committee and in his time as governor and commander in chief of the Idaho National Guard. Kempthorne also serves as chairman of the USS Idaho Commissioning Committee Advisory Board. 
The USS Idaho, SSN 799, is a Virginia-class, nuclear-powered submarine, which has “enhanced stealth, sophisticated surveillance capabilities and special warfare enhancements,” according to the Navy. The submarine was delivered from the shipbuilder to the Navy in December, and is now undergoing tests before being commissioned for active service, a Navy press release said. 
“The Engine Room, driven by a nuclear reactor pioneered at the Idaho National Laboratory, is the heart of the USS Idaho — further signifying Kempthorne’s integral role in the project,” Risch’s press release said.  
The commanding officer, Guillerault, wrote to Risch in a Jan. 6 letter that naming spaces aboard Navy submarines isn’t unusual, but that they are usually named for cities or locations, not people. 
“Governor Kempthorne has been intrinsically involved and a true advocate for our ship since
the day Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus announced the naming of USS IDAHO on August
23rd, 2015,” Guillerault wrote. “The drive he demonstrated as the 30th governor of Idaho propelling the state forward in technology and conservation, is the same drive and enthusiasm he has demonstrated in support of USS IDAHO. Therefore, I am pleased to inform you that we will be naming the USS IDAHO’s Engine Room in honor of Governor Kempthorne.”

,DC,2026-01-14 21:23:36+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Abortion pill safety review at FDA targeted by frustrated Republicans, advocates",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/abortion-pill-safety-review-fda-targeted-frustrated-republicans-advocates,,"WASHINGTON — Republicans on a key U.S. Senate committee on Wednesday called on the Food and Drug Administration to wrap up its ongoing safety review of medication abortion and pressed for the Trump administration to once again require in-person dispensing.Democrats on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee argued women, not politicians, are in the best position to determine whether to ask for a prescription for mifepristone. Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, chairman of the panel, said he hopes FDA Commissioner Marty Makary will agree to testify before the committee on the process in the future, though he didn’t set a deadline.  “At an absolute minimum, the previous in-person safeguards should be restored and it should be done immediately,” Cassidy said. Republicans and anti-abortion organizations have become increasingly skeptical about the FDA’s review after news broke in December that Makary wanted to delay its release until after the November midterm elections. Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray questioned Cassidy’s reasons for holding the hearing, saying more than “160 high-quality studies have been conducted and millions of women around the world use mifepristone safely every year with fewer complications, by the way, than Viagra or penicillin.” Supreme Court caseAccess to mifepristone, one of two pharmaceuticals used in medication abortion, which is FDA-approved for up to 10 weeks gestation, surged to the forefront after the U.S. Supreme Court ended the nationwide right to abortion in 2022. Many Republican state legislatures have moved to bar access to mifepristone for abortions, while Democratic states have enacted shield laws to protect health care providers who prescribe and ship it to people in states with limited or no access. Dr. Nisha Verma, a fellow at Physicians for Reproductive Health in Atlanta, testified before the committee that “the science on mifepristone’s safety and effectiveness is long-standing and settled.”“Over the past 25 years, medication abortion using mifepristone and misoprostol has been rigorously studied and proven safe and effective in over 100 high-quality, peer-reviewed studies,” Verma said. ""Extensive data show that medication abortion through telehealth is equally safe and effective and provides vital access for those who live in rural areas and in the growing number of maternity care deserts in the country.”Verma contended the likely reason for the hearing was not genuine concern from Republicans about the safety and efficacy of mifepristone but “because people in this room feel uncomfortable with abortion.”“And that's okay, and we can talk about that,” Verma said. “And we can have an honest conversation about that and complexity and the reasons that my patients need abortion care. But we should not pretend that this is an issue of the science.”Louisiana attorney general testifiesLouisiana Attorney General Elizabeth Murrill, a Republican, criticized the FDA’s decision during the Biden administration to allow prescriptions via telehealth and for the pharmaceuticals to be shipped, sometimes into states that bar their use. “Shield laws in some states protect providers from liability and effectively nullify laws in other states,” Murrill said. “Their purpose is to make it more difficult to sue or prosecute individuals in those states.”Indiana Republican Sen. Jim Banks expressed frustration that FDA Commissioner Makary was not among the witnesses testifying at the hearing and urged the agency to release the results of its review of mifepristone quickly. “I'm disappointed that the FDA under Dr. Makary’s leadership hasn't moved faster to restore the in-person dispensing requirement and strengthen the (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies) program for mifepristone,” Banks said. “I hope the rumors are false, some of them are in print, that the agency is intentionally slow-walking its study on mifepristone health risks.”Emily G. Hilliard, press secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes the FDA, wrote in a statement the department “is conducting a study of reported adverse events associated with mifepristone to assess whether the FDA’s risk mitigation program continues to provide appropriate protections for women.”“The FDA’s scientific review process is thorough and takes the time necessary to ensure decisions are grounded in gold-standard science,” Hilliard wrote. “Dr. Makary is upholding that standard as part of the Department’s commitment to rigorous, evidence-based review.”Cassidy said after Banks raised his concerns that he hopes to have Makary testify “before the committee very soon and we've been speaking with the FDA to facilitate discussion on this and other issues.”Cassidy added that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “did promise to come back and we have requested that he come back and testify.” Republicans, Family Research Council urge action by FDADuring a press conference after the hearing, Cassidy joined a handful of other GOP lawmakers and Family Research Council President Tony Perkins to further press the Trump administration to change the prescription guidelines for mifepristone. Perkins said the Trump administration could change FDA guidelines around how mifepristone is prescribed and distributed “overnight” if it wanted to. He also said it should immediately begin enforcing The Comstock Act, an 1873 law that could block shipping medication abortion.“This is a two-step solution. One, is the in-person requirement being reestablished, the medical examinations to ensure that the women, their lives, are not put at risk,” Perkins said. “But then also ... simply enforcing the law as it pertains to Comstock.”",,,,2026-01-14 16:57:14.696244

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration moved to take over Lakewood’s school district Wednesday, arguing that a slew of governance issues had deprived students there of the thorough education entitled to them by the state’s constitution.
In an order to show cause, the Department of Education said the township had failed to root out “pervasive, endemic educational and operational failures” first flagged more than 15 years ago and had continued to mismanage its resources at the cost of its students.
“For more than a decade, the New Jersey Department of Education has been working with the Lakewood Township School District to address ongoing fiscal and operational concerns that impact students, staff, parents, and the entire Lakewood community,” said Education Commissioner Kevin Dehmer. “For all of those impacted, most especially the students of Lakewood, we are obligated to intervene.”
The bid for a state takeover was first reported by the New Jersey Globe.
Lakewood, home to about 142,000 residents, is perhaps the most unique school district in New Jersey. Only 4,112 students were enrolled in October 2024, according to state data, compared to more than 50,000 who attended private religious schools, called yeshivas.
As a result, the district has spent heavily on transportation, special education, and other aid to its non-public schools, and that spending has built massive deficits into the district’s budget over time.
The district’s budget for the 2025-2026 school year includes a loan of about $100 million from the state. That followed nearly $200 million in loans over the prior two school years.
Sen. Bob Singer (R-Ocean), a Lakewood resident who has represented the township in the Legislature for 40 years, acknowledged the district’s issues but said it is too early to determine whether a state takeover could resolve them.
“We realize there’s been problems with the schools. We realize there’s been a shortfall of money, and we have to wait and see what the state does when they take it over,” he told the New Jersey Monitor.
If the State Board of Education approves the takeover, the state would appoint a new superintendent and business administrator, along with other professionals to oversee governance, fiscal management, and operations, including services for non-public students.
The township’s elected school board would remain in place in an advisory capacity and would gain new members appointed by the education commissioner.
A state intervention plan released alongside Wednesday’s court filing calls for the district and department to draft an improvement plan for the commissioner’s approval within six months of the full state takeover, though the intervention is likely to last far longer.
The state’s intervention in Newark’s public school system lasted 25 years before full control was returned to local officials.
Some Lakewood residents have previously charged that the state’s school funding formula is responsible for the district’s funding woes, though an appeals court ruling denied those claims in September, finding mismanagement, a failure to raise local taxes, and heavy spending on transportation and special education were clearer causes.
The takeover’s timing — initiated just six days before Gov. Phil Murphy leaves office — raised some questions about continuity. Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill, who takes office Tuesday, has not announced whether she will renominate Dehmer or replace him.
Singer said Dehmer told him this would be a yearlong process.
“It’s not going to happen overnight, and I’d like to have the continuity of knowing the person I’m dealing with is the person who can be there from the beginning to the end,” he said.

MONTPELIER — Vermont Gov. Phil Scott wants to use the state’s annual midyear budget tuneup to set aside $75 million for property tax relief. But legislative leaders said they would rather hold on to that money, at least for the time being.
“It’s just not appropriate to be doing it at this point in time,” said Rep. Robin Scheu, D-Middlebury, who chairs the budget-writing House Appropriations Committee.
At issue is how lawmakers will contend with the nearly 12% average increase in property taxes projected this year across the state. To blunt that expected hike, Scott wants to include about $75 million in this year’s legislative effort to true-up spending halfway through the current fiscal year, which is called the Budget Adjustment Act.
The money would come from additional revenue Vermont has brought in that lawmakers didn’t know they’d have access to when they were building a budget for the current year, which governs spending from July 2025 to June 2026. Lawmakers enacted the current state budget in May 2025.
For leaders of the House and Senate appropriations committees, though, it’s too early in the year’s legislative session — which started last week — to fence off that surplus. The “budget adjustment” is often one of the first bills lawmakers take up each year, though its passage is not a guarantee.
Instead, the committee chairs want the property tax buydown proposal to be part of negotiations over the new budget for the upcoming fiscal year. They said waiting would allow them to weigh the plan in a fuller context of state revenue needs and pressures; to be sure, it could also be a useful bargaining tool in negotiations with Scott’s administration. 
“We’re going to make a decision as part of the full budget,” Scheu said in an interview Tuesday.
Sen. Andrew Perchlik, D/P-Washington, said he needs to see what progress, if any, the Legislature makes toward advancing key provisions of last year’s sweeping education reform law, Act 73, before deciding whether to use the $75 million to reduce the property tax burden. The Senate Appropriations chair said he’s not sure at this point whether that is the right amount of money to spend on that purpose, either.
About half of the projected 12% tax hike would come from an expected jump in school spending, though districts are still in the process of formulating their budgets for the 2026-27 school year. The other half of the looming spike is the result of a fiscal hole left by lawmakers’ decision to use about $100 million to buy down property taxes in 2025.
Perchlik said the $75 million could also be used to respond to federal funding changes. The extent to which lawmakers can balance affordability concerns in the state with cuts from Washington, D.C., is likely to drive policy debate in the Statehouse this year. 
“We’re not saying we’re against that,” he said of the buydown plan. However, “we want to see the whole education plan. We also want to see what all the other needs are.”
For their proposed version of the budget adjustment legislation, House and Senate leaders are also weighing whether to spend additional money to support public housing authorities that administer federal Section 8 housing vouchers. Many of those providers are entering 2026 “in pretty precarious fiscal condition,” James Duffy, an analyst with the Legislature’s Joint Fiscal Office, told the House Appropriations panel on Tuesday.
That’s in part because the organizations are staring down uncertain federal support from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Duffy said, in addition to other challenges. Vermont’s House General and Housing Committee is slated to take testimony on the need for some additional funding Thursday.
Prison spending racks up
Scott’s budget adjustment proposal includes a number of other changes to state spending on human services, some of which are also driven by federal cuts. 
That includes directing about $1 million to Planned Parenthood of Northern New England. Tracy O’Connell, chief financial officer for the Vermont Agency of Human Services, said that money would make sure Planned Parenthood could continue serving some 16,000 patients in the state after the tax and domestic policy bill Trump signed last July ordered a one-year moratorium on Medicaid reimbursements for the organization.
Scott’s proposal also includes $25,000 for the Vermont Human Rights Commission to fill an expected lapse in funding from the Housing and Urban Development Department. Big Hartman, the commission’s executive director and general counsel, said the federal money has long supported a joint federal and state program that investigates housing discrimination complaints.
Vermont’s rising prison population is also driving up costs. The Scott administration has recommended a roughly $4.5 million increase in funding for Wellpath, the private-equity-owned contractor that provides health care in state correctional facilities. The increase is tied to an uptick in the state’s average daily prison population.
Meanwhile, the plan includes about $390,000 to cover the costs of sending about 30 people incarcerated in Vermont to the private prison the state uses in Mississippi, Jon Murad, the corrections commissioner, told Senate Appropriations on Tuesday.
There is also $225,000 to cover the costs of corrections staff being put up at hotels when there is such little time between their shifts that “it makes little sense” for them to travel home in between them, said Adam Greshin, Scott’s commissioner of finance and management, “even if they’ve just got a short drive.”
Scott’s budget adjustment proposal also includes $385,000 to outfit state office space in Waterbury, including in the new space the Scott administration leased ahead of the start of its return-to-office order in December. That new space, at Pilgrim Park, will be used by the Department of Vermont Health Access, according to Greshin.
The House and Senate appropriations committees are slated to continue taking testimony on those and other budget adjustment proposals this week.

(Florida Phoenix photo)Voters in Florida could have a chance to enshrine religious protections in schools in the Florida Constitution, the same protections already established in statute.
The measure, HJR 583, pitched as establishing a constant constitutional law as opposed to more-often-altered statutory law, passed the House Education Administration Subcommittee Wednesday. It has another committee date before heading to the full House.
Bill sponsor Rep. Chase Tramont, a Republican from Port Orange, called it “a very common-sense resolution.”
“All of this is in state statute right now, so it is current law. My argument would be that protecting religious liberty and expression is arguably the most necessary thing to do. Laws are constantly being shifted, repealed, amended, and all sorts of things that happen,” Tramont said during the first committee stop Wednesday.
Lawmakers are proposing language for voters to approve that would prohibit school districts from discriminating against students, parents, and school employees based on religious viewpoint.
“A school district shall treat a student’s voluntary expression of a religious viewpoint on an otherwise permissible subject in the same manner that the school district treats a student’s voluntary expression of a secular viewpoint,” it states in part.
Schools must allows religious expression in coursework, artwork, clothing, and prayer, as already protected under the 2017 Student and School Personnel Religious Liberties Act.
Tramont pointed out that the resolution does not mention any one religion and does include all faiths.
“That’s part of free speech — part of freedom of expression is the ability to be acceptance of all faiths,” Tramont said.
The resolution passed with one vote in opposition, Democratic Rep. Angie Nixon, who voiced concerns about how it could alter curriculum. She indicated a willingness to support the measure on the floor.
Devon Graham from American Atheists said the resolution is not necessary.
“The sponsors and supporters will say that nowhere in this bill is any specific religion mentioned, but this will just boost religious protections. This is not our first rodeo. This is all double speak that we’ve heard before,” Graham said during public comment.
Graham pointed to the 2021 measure that provides moment of silences in public schools, pitched initially as being a chance for self reflection and later lauded by the governor as a religious freedom measure and signed by him at a synagogue.
“Without supporting or discouraging student prayer, each public school must require teachers in first-period classrooms in all grades to set aside at least one minute, but not more than two minutes, daily for a moment of silence, during which a student may not interfere with other students’ participation,” the proposed amendment reads.
Graham also referenced DeSantis’ insistence that Satanists would not be permitted to participate in the school chaplain program passed in 2024 as “cherry-picking” religions.
SJR 1104, identical, has two committees to pass, too. It is sponsored by Sen. Ralph Massullo, a Republican from Lecanto.
For the joint resolution to be placed on the ballot, each chamber must approve it by a three-fifths vote.
The resolution, if passed, would be put on the ballot for the Nov. 3, 2026 election. It would require approval by at least 60% of voters to pass.
Of course, the U.S. Constitution provides religious protection, too. It requires teachers to remain neutral in treating religious matters in school.

(Volha Rahalskaya/Getty Images)Imagine starting the new year with the promise of at least a $147 million payout from the federal government.
But there are strings attached.
In late December, President Donald Trump’s administration announced how much all 50 states would get under its new Rural Health Transformation Program, assigning them to use the money to fix systemic problems that leave rural Americans without access to good health care. Now, the clock is ticking.
Within eight months, states must submit revised budgets, begin spending, and show the money is going to good use. Federal officials will begin reviewing state progress in late summer and announce 2027 funding levels by the end of October.
The money — divided into unique allocations for each state, ranging from $147 million for New Jersey to $281 million for Texas — represents the first $10 billion installment from the five-year, $50 billion program. Congress created the fund as a last-minute sweetener in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act last summer to offset the outsize fallout anticipated in rural communities from the statute’s nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid spending cuts over the next decade.
Feds award New Mexico $211.5 M for rural health funding

Federal officials crafted the fund to give states “space to be creative,” Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said on a call with reporters after announcing the funding Dec. 29. “Some states will fail, and we will learn from that.”
The money was divided according to a complicated formula.
In 2026, each state will receive an equal $100 million share under the law for the first half of the money, plus additional funding from the second half. Oz’s staff steered payouts from the second portion based on each state’s rural score, as well as results from a “technical” scoring system for project proposals.
Within hours of the announcement, academics and researchers began to parse the awards to better understand why some states received more than others, including whether the awards reflected any partisanship or political favoritism.
At first glance, total awards do not appear to favor states governed by either Republicans or Democrats. But one academic data analysis teased out the amount awarded for each state’s technical score, which is the part determined by the discretion of agency officials.
The analysis was performed at the University of North Carolina’s Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, which specializes in rural health. A KFF Health News review of the Sheps Center data found that states with Republican governors tended to receive more money for the parts of their application based on the technical score. Democratic-controlled states crowded the bottom quarter of those technical score awards.
Overall, though, the state awards reveal wild variation in how much money each state will get per rural resident, almost a hundredfold difference between the top and bottom.
In an emailed statement to The Arizona Republic, a spokesperson for Arizona’s Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs accused the administration of shortchanging rural residents in the state, which was awarded $167 million this year from the program.
CMS spokesperson Chris Krepich said in an emailed statement to KFF Health News that “politics played no role in funding decisions.”
On the December call, Oz pushed states to start working on policy actions championed by the administration — such as approving presidential fitness tests and restricting food benefits — that could require legislative approval.
Half of states promised to mandate the presidential fitness test, Oz said. Many states also proposed food waivers under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, which would limit low-nutrition items such as soda. He also said some states promised to teach health care professionals about nutrition. And others confirmed they will repeal certificate-of-need laws, which require companies to prove that new health facilities they want to open are necessary.
Krepich said CMS’ new Office of Rural Health Transformation is hiring program officers to serve as point people for three or four states. Many states are setting up their own offices to oversee the new funding.
Oz highlighted Alabama’s “big maternity initiative with robotics doing ultrasounds” and said states are tackling issues ranging from behavioral health to obesity.
A KFF Health News review of state “project abstracts” and “spotlights” released by CMS shows that many states plan to address the workforce challenges in rural areas. Delaware, for example, plans to use its funding to create the state’s first four-year medical school with a rural primary care track.
A third of states said they want to improve electronic health records, and every state mentioned telehealth.
Many state legislatures must pass laws to distribute the funding to their state offices. Meanwhile, state officials are hiring staff, organizing advisory committees, and preparing to dole out money.
“I’m excited about what’s next,” said Terry Scoggin, former interim chief executive of the Texas Organization of Rural & Community Hospitals, or TORCH. Texas was awarded the biggest allocation. The money will bolster a rural hospital funding bill Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed last year, Scoggin said.
More than two dozen cash-strapped rural hospitals in Texas have closed or been converted to clinics since 2005, a nationwide trend that hit the Lone Star State particularly hard. The state has the largest rural population in the United States. Texas’ allocation amounts to about $66 per rural resident, according to a KFF policy analysis. By contrast, Rhode Island was granted about $6,300 per rural resident.
Scoggin said he has “a ton of concerns” about companies taking the money instead of it helping rural hospitals and residents. “I was blown away about how many for-profit companies reached out.” The companies have also called rural hospitals and asked to work with them to apply for state money, he said.
The awards should be judged on how they benefit rural residents because “the stated goal of the program is to improve rural health,” said Paula Chatterjee, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania who co-authored a Senate Finance Committee memo on the transformation fund.
Researchers at the Sheps Center conducted the analysis to estimate how much money states received from the technical score, which is the portion of funding based on the quality of their proposals and state policy actions that align with “Make America Healthy Again” priorities.
New Mexico won the least amount of technical funding, with less than 10% of its award based on the discretionary metrics. Alaska won the largest technical award, according to the Sheps Center data.
Texas, Nebraska, New Hampshire, and Hawaii rounded out the top five recipients of technical funding. In addition to New Mexico, the other lowest technical awards went to Michigan, New Jersey, Arizona, and California.
Mark Holmes, director of the Sheps Center, declined to comment on whether he saw any political bias in the awards but said the nuance in the final portion of discretionary awards based on technical scores is important because those dollars can be redistributed and potentially clawed back in future years.
“We can be fairly certain that every state will get at least a slightly, if not a vastly, different amount next year based on this re-pooling and reallocation piece,” Holmes said.
States now have a limited time to show they’re using the money effectively to secure future funding.
But they can’t start spending yet. CMS followed standard grant procedures and is requiring each state to submit revised budgets before they can draw down money, Krepich said.
States have until Jan. 30 to resubmit their budgets, and CMS then has 30 days to respond, according to the standard Notice of Award. Under that timing, some states may not have cash in hand until March.
“CMS is working closely with states to complete this process as efficiently as possible,” Krepich said.

(Photo: AYA House)AYA House, a nonprofit organization that provides transitional housing and supportive services for people recovering from substance dependence or transitioning from incarceration, will open its first location in Rowan County on Friday, Jan. 16.
The program will serve adult men transitioning from jail or prison in Vaya Health’s easternmost counties, which include Alamance, Caswell, Chatham, Franklin, Granville, Person, Rockingham, Rowan, Stokes and Vance.
Vaya Health provides and manages health services for people with mental health, substance use and intellectual/developmental disabilities. It partnered with AYA House to provide reentry employment services in the counties it serves after the NC Department of Health and Human Services awarded it $1.5 million from a federal Expanding Supports for Justice Involved Adults-Community Based Initiatives grant.
Dennis Brown, executive director of AYA House, says programs like this are essential to setting previously incarcerated people on the right path after they return home. Brown, who was previously incarcerated, said housing is a huge barrier for people who are released from prison.
“A lot of us that got caught up in the justice system, we have lost family, we have lost the connection to a lot of families, and some of us do not want to go back to our own communities,” Brown said. “Providing these kind of services and not just providing a bed or a home, but providing service along with it, a support team to go along with it, makes a big difference.”
Brown said the Rowan County program will start with five clients, and then “we’ll go from there.” Two houses will be used for the program, Brown said. One will serve as a residence for clients and the other as an “employment lab,” he said.
AYA House already operates six diversion and reentry locations in neighboring Cabarrus County. It provides wraparound support and services, including employment and education services designed to build long-term stability and independence.
In Cabarrus, Brown said AYA House has partnered with Rowan-Cabarrus Community College, which provides scholarships for clients to earn certification in logistics, manufacturing, welding and other skilled professions.
“After that, we help them get into a career, not just a job, but a career,” Brown said. “By doing that, it sets them on a different path to make a livable wage, and you can see ahead of you and not just look down on the ground like we usually do.”

After a close vote and before contested ballots were adjudicated, members of the ski safety crew ended the initiative.
The post Jackson Hole Ski Patrol withdraws union push appeared first on WyoFile .","The Jackson Hole Ski Patrol has backed out of plans to form a union.
The patrol has withdrawn its petition to form the union, which it had filed with the National Labor Relations Board, according to the federal agency’s website.
The website posting marks the end of an effort by the patrol to form a collective bargaining group to negotiate with the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort over wages and other employment issues. The labor board posted the notice Wednesday morning and reclassified the case as “closed.”
After the ski patrol withdrew the petition on Jan. 9, the board issued an order Wednesday that apparently resolved the case.
The labor board organized an election, held Jan. 7-8, that resulted in a 42-32 vote against unionization. Another 16 ballots were contested among those cast by the 90 voters who were potentially eligible, the NLRB said.
“The owners stepped up.” Anonymous ski patroller
Those contested ballots in the secret election could have tipped the balance one way or the other. The labor board was set to rule on the admissibility of the contested ballots and adjust the vote count before the ski patrol withdrew its petition.
The NLRB listed the reason the case was closed as “Withdrawal Non-adjusted.”
The contested votes were in doubt because of the positions held by those who cast them. Some voters could have been supervisors, could have held other positions deemed ineligible for voting, or could have been challenged for other reasons.
The close vote suggests that talks between Jackson Hole Mountain Resort officials and ski patrollers bore fruit in convincing some patrollers that matters over a living wage, insurance and other things could best be resolved without collective bargaining as a union. Most of the patrol signed a petition seeking the election — so the vote didn’t closely follow that initial indication of union support.
As the issue developed over the fall, younger patrollers favored unionization compared to veterans, a patroller who spoke on the condition of anonymity said. The patroller who spoke with WyoFile said he did not want to be harassed for public statements.
The patroller was an older employee who had a good off-season income and secure housing and didn’t expect to be paid a “living wage.” That underscored the age divide in the group, he suggested, with younger workers favoring collective bargaining.
But the resort owners met with ski patrollers to explain how they would change things, the patroller said. Federal laws limit what employers can say during such election periods and prohibit them from threatening jobs, promising promotions, campaigning at mandatory staff meetings close to the election and other similar things.
Nevertheless, “the owners stepped up,” the patroller said, giving every employee an opportunity to talk with company representatives. “They apologized for some meetings last spring,” when relationships went south.
An all-team meeting with owners before the vote was “really good,” the patroller said and showed “these guys are making themselves available.”
Also, following withdrawal of a petition, the effort to unionize could be resurrected in six months, the ’troller said. That could give patrollers an opportunity, if the mountain resort management doesn’t satisfy the corps, to revisit unionization.
The Jackson Hole vote stirred interest in part because of a ski patrol strike in Telluride, Colorado, where the walkout shut down most of the mountain for nearly two weeks. Conflicts between the Telluride crew and the resort owner differed from the Jackson Hole situation, the Wyoming patroller said.
“I trust these guys,” the patroller said of the new Jackson Hole Mountain Resort owners. Mountain resort board members Eric Macy, Mike Corbat, their families and a small, select group of co-investors now own and run the Wyoming landmark ski area on the Bridger-Teton National Forest above Teton Village.
Some fret about putting the well-being of an entire community in the hands of 90 ski patrollers who could strike and bring the winter economy to a standstill. A strike would “hurt this town so much,” the patroller said.
Ski patrollers posted Friday on Instagram that they were no longer unionizing.
“After a vote, we have chosen as a team not to unionize at this time,” the post read. “The petition and vote have created space for dialogue and to give new ownership the opportunity to listen and respond.”
A mountain resort official said Monday that the final outcome “is pending due to challenged ballots and procedural matters.” Those are now resolved.
Ski patrollers thanked the community via Instagram “for the overwhelming support,” and said, “we’ll see you on the hill.”

Caryn Tyson appears on the Senate floor on April 10, 2025. She is chair of the Senate Assessment and Taxation Committee for the 2026 session, and she led hearings on a property tax relief bill. (Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A group of GOP senators want to amend the Kansas Constitution to establish an annual cap on a home’s taxable assessed value, but opinions are split on whether it will provide real relief.
The proposal, called the Cap Assessed Valuation Protection amendment, confines a county appraiser’s annual home value assessments to a 3% increase or less compared to the previous year’s assessed value.
However, the proposal does not change a local taxing entity’s ability to impose mill levy increases or decreases.
Proponents said during committee hearings Tuesday and Wednesday the resolution will produce lower residential property taxes. Opponents said the resolution, as written, is likely to shift the tax burden to other property types, such as agricultural land, and create an illusion of residential property tax relief.
“As it stands today, there is a lot of finger-pointing, and I will say nobody’s wrong and everybody’s wrong at the same time,” said Maddie Bouton, deputy administrator for the city of Basehor.
Some people could see a lower property tax amount with a cap in place compared to previous years. But because local governments still retain the authority to set tax rates, lower property taxes are not a given.











Despite differing opinions on the potential outcomes of the cap, nearly everyone agreed on one thing: Property taxes are a problem.











Bouton said property tax is a local issue and that the state should hand it back to local governments.
Under the proposed amendment, property owners would be taxed based on the assessed value, as determined by law, or the capped assessed value — whichever is less. The proposal is a cap on increases. It does not apply if values decrease or increase below 3%, and certain conditions apply, including if new construction or home improvements occur on the property.
Republican Sen. Caryn Tyson, a software engineer from Parker and chair of the Senate tax committee, was an advocate for the proposal, challenging opponents to explain how it would not benefit taxpayers. She said the proposal has been years in the making. It is co-sponsored by 15 Republican senators. If approved by a two-thirds majority in both chambers and by a majority of voters in a special election on Aug. 4, 2026, the cap would go into effect in January 2027.
Legislators have repeatedly described property tax relief as a major policy deliverable for their constituents. The Legislature during the 2025 session nixed a combined 1.5 mills that funded the Kansas educational building and state institutional building funds. Tyson promised more tax relief efforts as the 2026 session progresses.
Establishing a constitutional amendment capping final taxable assessed value increases would be among the most substantial in a string of tax legislation in recent years.
Sean Miller, a lobbyist for the Kansas Building Industry Association, testified Wednesday the resolution does not actually reduce taxes.
Taxable assessed valuation is one of many variables, he said, and without a corresponding cap on taxing entities’ budgets or mill levies, the resolution only shifts around those variables.
He called it a “confusing, if not artificial, cap.”
The resolution also incentivizes staying in one’s home, preventing downsizing and the natural churn of movement from housing types as people’s life circumstances change, which is a necessary part of the real estate market, Miller said.
There were differing opinions on how the agriculture community viewed the bill. Eric Estes of the Kansas Deere Dealers Association argued a 3% cap would be good for farm and agriculture operators, which he backed up by presenting 20 years’ worth of projections, applying Oklahoma’s 3% cap. The data from the Kansas Policy Institute, which was not verified by the committee or Kansas Reflector, showed farm and agriculture operators could have saved $1 billion in taxes over 10 years.
Matt Teagarden, CEO of the Kansas Livestock Association, said its members continue to oppose a valuation cap. The topic has been on association agendas at roundtables, meetings and conventions since the fall of 2024.
Teagarden and association members worry establishing a cap will shift the tax burden to agricultural property owners, resulting in them paying more for land, home improvements, commercial property and vehicles.
“We support property tax relief and stand ready to provide solutions that actually provide that property tax relief,” he said.
Many of the same associations, organizations and figures testified Tuesday and Wednesday as in January 2024. Lobbyists for the Kansas Farm Bureau and the Kansas Association of School Boards returned to express opposition. Lanell Griffith, a Topeka resident and chair of the Shawnee County Republican Party, and Sen. Mike Thompson, a Shawnee Republican, voiced their support.
Mark Tomb, vice president of governmental affairs for the Kansas Realtors Association, also opposed the resolution, worrying a cap could pressure local governments into raising their budgets. He favored voter-driven constraints on local entities and levies.
Republican Sen. Tim Shallenburger, a longtime politician from Baxter Springs, pushed back.
Legislators represent the people, he said.
“The people who aren’t here are grandma,” he said, referencing an earlier mention of an elderly widow paying more in property taxes than she could afford.
He said the cap may mean real estate agents lose commissions, or tax burdens could shift to agricultural land.
“But we’re here for the people, and the homeowners we go and see when we knock on doors (say), ‘Can you do something about the property taxes?’ ”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4100102-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-14 16:57:14.696244

Nearly two dozen people are hoping to become the next member of Congress to represent northwest Georgia.
Voters in Georgia’s 14th District – which includes Catoosa, Chattooga, Dade, Floyd, Murray, Paulding, Polk, Walker and Whitfield counties and portions of Cobb County – will head to the polls starting on Monday, Feb. 16 when early voting kicks off.
The three-day candidate qualifying period ended Wednesday afternoon.
All of the candidates will appear on the same ballot regardless of party, and 17 Republicans, three Democrats, one Libertarian and one independent have qualified, according to the secretary of state’s office.
Election Day is set for March 10, and if no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, which is likely with so many names on the ballot, a runoff between the top two candidates is scheduled for April 7.
The district is considered the most likely in the state to favor a Republican, according to the Cook Political Report. It was previously represented by firebrand conservative Marjorie Taylor Greene. Greene resigned earlier this month after publicly feuding with President Donald Trump over matters including health insurance subsidies, Israel’s bombing campaign in Gaza and the release of the Epstein files.
The winner will only earn the right to serve out the rest of Greene’s term and will have to prepare immediately for a primary in May and a general election in November.

(Photo courtesy of Utah Valley University)Utah Valley University President Astrid Tuminez announced Wednesday she will step down from her role on May 1 after more than seven years, the last of which was marked by tragedy.
The announcement comes after Tuminez experienced a rough 2025 marked by her husband Jeffrey Tolk’s sudden death in February and the shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at the university’s campus in September. 
She said Wednesday she’s resigning to devote more time to her family and personal pursuits.

“UVU has been a labor of love for me. The university’s call to ‘come as you are’ recognizes and cultivates human potential in bold ways that traditional institutions may overlook,” Tuminez said in a news release. “Education transformed my life from the slums of the Philippines to a global adventure, and I brought that conviction to UVU. My heart will always be green.”
Tuminez led UVU since the fall of 2018, making history as the first woman to serve as a full-time president at Utah’s largest university. As a student, transferred from the University of the Philippines to Brigham Young University, where she earned a bachelor’s degree in international relations and Russian literature. Tuminez also has a master’s degree in Soviet studies from Harvard University and a Ph.D. in political science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
“President Tuminez has been a deeply thoughtful leader who has consistently championed student success,” Utah System of Higher Education Commissioner Geoffrey Landward said in a statement. “We are grateful for her leadership and will work closely with the board and the university to ensure a smooth and well-supported transition.” 
A highlight of Tuminez’s tenure is Vision 2030, according to the university, a 10-year plan to better support students, community and workforce. 
The Utah Board of Higher Education is now establishing a presidential transition team with representatives from the board, the Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education, and UVU trustees who will oversee the new leadership search process over the next several months, the university said in the release. 
The presidential transition team will continue working through the first six months of the new president’s tenure, as part of a new presidential search model, the university added. That would extend their support beyond the hiring process.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Dear Denmark,
It’s been a while. Cold and wet over there, huh? Same here, plus a fair bit of snow and lots of ICE.
Just wanted to write you a quick note to tell you that we know how you feel.
We’ve been hearing a lot lately about how confused you are. President Donald Trump — the leader of the United States, one of your staunchest allies — wants you to sell us, or just give us, Greenland. If you don’t, he’s threatening to seize it by force.
What’s so senseless about it is that the United States already has a treaty with you where we can already pretty much do what we want in Greenland. Crazy, huh?
Both you and the Greenlanders seem to have little say in the matter. That such an action might even break up the 76-year-old NATO alliance seems to make no difference. If it wasn’t so scary, it would be absurd.
Vladimir Putin must be so happy right now.
Anyways, I thought I would write this note to let you know we here in Minnesota are pretty confused too. We’re part of the United States, but we’re being treated like we’re not. Kind of like how the U.S. has an alliance with you but is acting as though it doesn’t.
Trump seems really angry with Minnesota right now. To be sure, we’ve had some issues here. He decided to cut off millions of federal dollars already budgeted to support small business owners and farmers and child care centers in our state. It’s pretty bad. In fact, he’s says he’s going to cut off all federal funding to the entire state starting next month.
But it gets worse! Trump has suggested Minnesota will see “a day of reckoning and retribution.” We already have hundreds of heavily armed federal agents swarming over the state. They’re dragging people out of cars based on how they look or how they talk; going door-to-door with guns (but without warrants); detaining people during raids on our schools and hospitals; and even shooting and killing people in the street!
It’s wild! I mean, we’re one of the fifty United States. It’s like Trump doesn’t want Minnesota to be part of the country anymore. He is treating us even worse than he’s treating you — which is pretty bad. And we’re Americans! Nearly half of Minnesotans voted for him last fall!
Just like you, we are standing our ground. But it’s scary and weird, right?
Please know that you are not alone.
Yours truly,
Minnesota",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260107_661-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-14 15:57:47.886831

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Immigrant rights groups are condemning a move by Kenosha County Sheriff David Zoerner to join the federal 287(g) program, a cooperation agreement between local law enforcement agencies and federal immigration enforcement. Although Zoerner previously distanced his office from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), on Monday he announced that an agreement had been signed with the federal agency back mid-December.
Just a couple of months before joining the 287(g) program, Zoerner questioned whether the program would benefit Kenosha County taxpayers. “This is a rapidly evolving program,” Zoerner told TMJ4. “We are monitoring it to ensure that our participation would ultimately be in the best interest of the taxpayers of Kenosha County.” At the time of the interview, the sheriff’s office did not cooperate with ICE beyond honoring immigration detainers for people held in the Kenosha County jail. 
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The immigrant rights group Voces de la Frontera condemned Zoerner’s policy shift. “As an elected official, Sheriff Zoerner took an oath to defend the Constitution and ensure community safety,” Voces’ executive director Christine Neumann-Ortiz said in a statement. “Instead, he has broken promises behind closed doors and sacrificed the public trust for political expediency. It is the height of irresponsibility for Sheriff Zoerner to deputize his officers as ICE agents in a city that already experienced the tragic shooting of Jacob Blake and the community outrage that sparked massive protests, unrest, and the tragic death of two young protesters in 2020.” 
Neumann-Ortiz said that Zoerner’s decision “only heightens the risk to the community of harm by the militarized tactics of ICE.” 
In a statement issued Monday, Zoerner walked back his  previous caution about cooperating with ICE.
Zoerner said that “for well over a year” he has been working with ICE and other sheriffs “to bring the 287(g) to Kenosha County.” Saying that “this is not a new idea, and this is not reactionary,” Zoerner said that joining the program “is the result of deliberate, responsible planning focused on one mission: protecting the people of Kenosha County.” 
The sheriff pushed back against what he called “misinformation” about the issue and asserted that this office “works closely and consistently with our federal law enforcement partners.” He added,  “I will not tolerate the release of violent criminal offenders back into our community. Period. As Sheriff, I use every lawful tool at my disposal to protect citizens.” Zoerner noted that he currently serves on the Border Security Committee for the National Sheriffs Association, and that he’s undergone border security training and observed enforcement operations along the southern border in Texas and Arizona. 
Zoerner said that he signed a 287(g) agreement under a jail enforcement model. The agreement was signed by ICE and sent back to the Kenosha County Sheriff’s Office on Jan. 12. “We have already selected staff for this program and are actively moving forward with implementation,” Zoerner said in a statement, adding that the program “applies only to individuals who are already lawfully in custody for serious criminal offenses.”
Kenosha County’s 287(g) program, Zoerner said, will focus on people arrested for violent crimes, felony drug charges, repeat offenders, or those with histories of assault, sexual violence and other serious crimes. “These are people who pose a demonstrated threat to public safety,” said Zoerner. “This agreement ensures they are not released back into our community.” 
ICE cooperation a campaign issue
On Jan. 7, five days before Zoerner’s announcement, James Beller declared that he will challenge  Zoerner in the upcoming election for sheriff. Beller is currently a Kenosha police captain, and said that if elected he would move forward with joining the ICE 287 (g) program. 
Beller pitched the program as focusing only on serious criminal offenses, using the same language  Zoerner used to describe the deal he struck with the federal government. “This is about public safety and accountability,” Beller said in a press release. “The focus will be on serious offenders already in custody, implemented professionally, lawfully, and consistent with our responsibility to keep the community safe.” 
Those reassurances did not assuage  the concerns of people worried about the effects of ICE surges in Chicago and Minneapolis, where violent clashes with residents have made headlines and U.S. citizen Renee Good was shot and killed last week. 
There are currently 13 law enforcement agencies in Wisconsin with 287(g) programs, all of them sheriff’s offices. “This has to end,” said Nuemann-Ortiz. “We stand with Kenosha families in calling for an end to 287(g) in Kenosha.”

“Although I don’t deserve it, I ask for your collective mercy,” said Kendrick A. Simpson during a Pardon and Parole Board clemency hearing that included his victims’ family members and a survivor, London Johnson. “I’m not the worst of the worst. I’m not a monster.”

Simpson  is set to be the first person executed by Oklahoma this year.
Simpson, 45, who relocated to Oklahoma City following Hurricane Katrina 2005, said he was young, traumatized, ignorant and compelled by paranoia when he in 2005 fired about 20 rounds from an assault-style rifle into a Caprice carrying Glen Palmer, Anthony Jones, 19, and Johnson. Palmer and Jones were killed.
The murders followed an altercation at a club.
Prior to the murders, Simpson was incarcerated for an armed home invasion robbery in which he shot a business owner, who survived.
Simpson’s attorneys argued he suffered from a traumatized upbringing that included drugs and violence and childhood sexual assault. He  was also a victim of a drive-by-shooting, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and paranoia when he arrived in Oklahoma City, they said.
Johnson, the survivor who is now the father of six children, said “part of me died in that car as well. Those were my best friends.”
He said he has had sleepless nights going over the images of his friends “bleeding out” in the car.
“This ruthless and violent killer hunted and executed his victims without remorse,” said Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond. “I commend the Pardon and Parole Board for rejecting clemency today.”

Attorney General Rob Bonta said his office is looking into whether a new AI image editing tool from Elon Musk’s company violates California law.


California Attorney General Rob Bonta today announced an investigation into how and whether Elon Musk’s X and xAI broke the law in the past few weeks by enabling the spread of naked or sexual imagery without consent.
xAI reportedly updated its Grok artificial intelligence tool last month to allow image editing. Users on the social media platform X, which is connected to the tool, began using Grok to remove clothing in pictures of women and children.
“The avalanche of reports detailing the non-consensual sexually explicit material that xAI has produced and posted online in recent weeks is shocking,” Bonta said in a written statement. “This material, which depicts women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations, has been used to harass people across the internet. I urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further.”
Bonta urged Californians who want to report depictions of them or their children undressed or commiting sexual acts to visit oag.ca.gov/report.
Research obtained by Bloomberg found that X now produces more non-consensual naked or sexual imagery than any other website online. In a posting on X, Musk promised “consequences” for people who made illegal content with the tool. On Friday, Grok limited image editing to paying subscribers.
One potential route for Bonta to prosecute xAI is a law that went into effect just two weeks ago creating legal liability for the creation and distribution of “deepfake” pornography.
 X and xAI appear to be violating the provisions of that law, known as AB 621, said Sam Dordulian, who previously worked in the sex crimes unit of the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office but today works as a lawyer for people in cases involving deepfakes or revenge porn in private practice.
Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, author of the law, told CalMatters in a statement last week that she reached out to prosecutors, including the attorney general’s office and the city attorney of San Francisco, to remind them that they can act under the law. What’s happening on X, Bauer-Kahan said, is what AB 621 was designed to address. 
“Real women are having their images manipulated without consent, and the psychological and reputational harm is devastating,” the San Ramon Democrat said in an emailed statement. “Underage children are having their images used to create child sexual abuse material, and these websites are knowingly facilitating it.”
Bonta’s inquiry also comes shortly after a call for an investigation by Gov. Gavin Newsom, backlash from regulators in the European Union and India and X bans in Malaysia, Indonesia, and potentially the United Kingdom. As Grok app downloads rise in Apple and Google app stores, X is facing calls by lawmakers and advocates to ban downloads.
Why Grok created the feature the way it did and how it will respond to the controversy around it is unclear, and answers may not be forthcoming, since an analysis recently concluded that it’s the least transparent of major AI systems available today. xAI did not address questions about the investigation from CalMatters. 
“The psychological and reputational harm is devastating.”Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, Democratic Assemblymember, San Ramon
Evidence of concrete harm from deepfakes is piling up. In 2024, the FBI warned that use of deepfake tools to extort young people is a growing problem that has led to instances of self harm and suicide. Multiple audits have found that child sexual abuse material is inside the training data of AI models, making them capable of geneating vulgar photos. A 2024 Center for Democracy and Technology survey found that 15 percent of high school students have heard of or seen sexually explicit imagery of someone they know at school in the past year.
The investigation announced today is the latest action by the attorney general to push AI companies to keep kids safe. Late last year, Bonta endorsed a bill that would have prevented chatbots that talk about self harm and engage in sexually explicit conversations  from interacting with people under 18. He also joined attorneys general from 44 other states in sending a letter that questions why companies like Meta and OpenAI allow their chatbots to have sexually inappropriate conversations with minors.
California has passed roughly half a dozen laws since 2019 to protect people from deepfakes. The latest, Assembly Bill 621, amends and strengthens a 2019 law, most significantly by allowing district attorneys to bring cases against companies that “recklessly aid and abet” the distribution of deepfakes without the consent of the person depicted nude or committing sexual acts. That means the average person can ask the state Attorney General or the district attorney where they live to file a case on their behalf. It also increases the maximum amount that a judge can award a person from $150,000 to $250,000. Under the law, a public prosecutor is not required to prove that an individual depictured in an AI generated nude or sexual image suffered actual harm to bring a case to court. Websites who refuse to comply within 30 days can face penalties of $25,000 per violation.
In addition to those laws, two bills (AB 1831 and SB 1381) signed into law in 2024 expand the state’s definition of child pornography to make possession or distribution of artificially-generated child sexual abuse material illegal. Another required social media platforms to give people an easy way to request the immediate removal of a deepfake, and defines the posting of such material as a form of digital identity theft. A California law limiting the use of deepfakes in elections was signed into law last year but was struck down by a federal judge last summer following a lawsuit by X and Elon Musk. 
Every new state law helps give lawyers like Dordulian a new avenue to address harmful uses of deepfakes, but he said people still need new laws to protect themselves. He said his clients face challenges proving violation of existing laws since they require distribution of explicit materials, for example with a messaging app or social media platform, for protections to kick in. In his experience, people who use nudify apps typically know each other, so distribution doesn’t always take place, and if it does, it can be hard to prove.
For example, he said, he has a client who works as a nanny who alleges that the father of the kids she takes care of made images of her using photos she posted on Instagram. The nanny found the images on his iPad. This discovery was disturbing for her and caused her emotional trauma, but since he can’t use deepfake laws he has to sue on the basis of negligence or emotional distress and laws that were never created to address deepfakes. Similarly, victims told CNBC last year that the distinction between creating and distributing deepfakes left a gap in the law in a number of U.S. states.
“The law needs to keep up with what’s really happening on the ground and what women are experiencing, which is just the simple act of creation itself is the problem,” Dordulian said.
California is at the forefront of passing laws to protect people from deepfakes, but existing law isn’t meeting the moment, said Jennifer Gibson, cofounder and director of Psst, a group created a little over a year ago that provides pro bono legal services to tech and AI workers interested in whistleblowing. A California law that went into effect January 1 protects whistleblowers inside AI companies but only if they work on catastrophic risk that can kill more than 50 people or cause more than $1 billion in damages. If the law protected people who work on deepfakes, former X employees who detailed witnessing Grok generating illegal sexually explicit material last year to Business Insider would, Gibson said, have had protections if they  shared the information with authorities.
“There needs to be a lot more protection for exactly this kind of scenario in which an insider sees that this is foreseeable, knows that this is going to happen, and they need somewhere to go to report to both to keep the company accountable and protect the public.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/072823-X-Former-Twitter-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-14 15:57:47.886831

At more than $6.50 a pound, a 300% increase since 2010, the high average cost of ground beef — long a protein staple for time- and cash-strapped families — is straining grocery budgets. 
At just under $32,000 a year to place an infant and 4-year-old in center-based child care, the cost of early care and education in New Hampshire is leaving families in an impossible situation: Parents can’t afford to work, and of course they can’t afford not to.
At $40,000 a year, the high price for an in-state student to attend the University of New Hampshire is leaving local kids in a financial hole before their adult lives even begin. What kind of spending power can this state realistically expect from Gen Z 10 or 20 years after graduation, that is if they even stick around, when they’re carrying so much debt? 
At an annual average worker contribution of nearly $7,000 for an employer-sponsored family health care plan, the rising cost of insurance coverage has become an anticipated yearly pay cut for American workers. 
At $535,000, the median price for a home in New Hampshire is unaffordable for all but 15% of the state’s population.
But as far as Gov. Kelly Ayotte is concerned, everything is groovy.
“Our state remains the envy of the nation,” she said in a statement Friday. “No. 1 for public safety, health care, child wellbeing, economic freedom, taxpayer return on investment, home internet connectivity, and the lowest tax burden in the nation.”
Ayotte’s not wrong about New Hampshire’s collection of accolades from think tanks and special interests, but what she doesn’t mention is the tyranny of averages underlying her rosy picture. Claremont and Pelham, for example, have comparable populations of between roughly 13,000 and 14,000 people, but economically they couldn’t be more different. The median household income in Claremont, for example, is about $54,000 while the average in Pelham is just under $127,000.
So, Claremont’s median is about half the state’s, but stirred together with a more affluent community like Pelham, things don’t look so bad. Add in another similarly populated town like Amherst, with its median household income of $150,000, and all of a sudden it looks like New Hampshire has drafted a clear blueprint for the other 49 states to follow.
The median income for those three communities is more than $110,000, the kind of number that gives New Hampshire its dubious title as one of the richest states in one of the world’s richest nations. I guess the still-struggling families of Claremont and the many, many other working-class communities in the state just don’t know how to appreciate a good average.
As ridiculous as Ayotte may look in her rose-colored glasses, that occasional eyewear is still preferable to the standard dark shades of her party partners in Concord and Washington.
I don’t think one politician or even one party is responsible for the high cost of beef, child care, a college education, health insurance, or housing. But unlike the Trump administration and its henchmen and henchwomen in the New Hampshire State House, I know that the overall unaffordability is not caused by immigrants. I know that diversity, in society just as in nature, strengthens rather than weakens communities. And, I know that any “fraud” committed by poor people receiving government benefits is a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of the fraud committed by the nation’s wealthiest people collectively, including the legalized fraud inherent in legislation like the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the crimes of avoidance and evasion made possible by the lax enforcement, by design, of existing tax laws.
I know, too, that the Republican Party often wins elections not by articulating policy positions but by tapping American reservoirs of blame, fear, and hatred. I know that the language of religion is often used by Republican Party leaders to establish the illusion of moral authority, despite the obvious immorality of the violence and cruelty they perpetuate. I know that a vision of progress that strips any population of basic human rights, a nightmare that is playing out right now in cities across the nation, is a tragic regression.
And, I know that most Republicans know all of this, too.
It’s just that actually solving problems for the people requires a lot of time and hard work, and lying to them about who or what is to blame for their struggles is the easiest thing in the world.
This, all the fresh pain and chaos on top of the same old problems, is what easy gets you.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/P1152886-Ayotte-press-conference-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-14 15:57:47.886831

Kay Ivey enters the Alabama State Capitol ahead of the State of the State address speech on Tuesday, Jan. 13, 2026, in Montgomery, Ala. Ivey's 2027 budget proposals would call for an additional $570 million for the Education Trust Fund and a cut of about $29 million to the General Fund, with most programs level-funded or cut and extra money going to salary increases and insurance.  (Estela Munoz for Alabama Reflector)Gov. Kay Ivey has proposed an increase of about $569.8 million (5.8%) for the Education Trust Fund (ETF) next year and a total of about $28.5 million in cuts (0.8%)  to the General Fund.
The proposals for the 2027 fiscal year, presented to legislators on Wednesday, would effectively direct any additional money in the budgets toward 2% pay raises for employees and funding to avert increased health insurance costs. 
Ivey’s ETF proposal would also increase funding for the CHOOSE Act, a school voucher-type program, from $180 million to a total of $250 million in the 2027-28 school year. Most education programs and nearly all General Fund programs would be level-funded or reduced by some amount.
“The General Fund prioritizes responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars while making targeted investments in public safety and other core services Alabamians rely on every day,” Ivey said in a statement on Wednesday. “This will ensure that Alabama remains the best state to live, work and raise a family,” Ivey said in a statement Wednesday. 
The Legislature will make the final decisions on spending in the budgets. The current ETF is $9.9 billion; the current General Fund is $3.7 billion. The cut in the General Fund would be one of the first to the budgets in several years.

Hovering over the budgets are increased health care costs that could drive up costs for employees. The Public Education Employees’ Health Insurance Plan (PEEHIP) requested $380 million to avoid cost increases in the coming year. 
Finance Director Bill Poole told legislators Wednesday that Ivey proposed a $210 million increase. “That’s just a little bit more than half of the PEEHIP request,” he said. “So that will leave a gap that the PEEHIP program and the PEEHIP board will need to consider and address.”
Poole said fully funding PEEHIP’s request would have “nearly consumed the entirety of the new funding that could be eligible for appropriation in the ETF direct budget for all education purposes.”
Ivey also proposed that the Child Health Care Insurance Plan (CHIP) be funded through ETF supplemental funds this year.
“It has been paid at times out of both budgets. So it has gone back and forth through the years. At present, it is fully funded in the general fund,” Poole said. “Given this is children’s health insurance, this package proposes that the FY 27 growth in that liability or obligation be funded out of the ETF supplemental. That is a conversation that has gone back and forth for years. I suspect it is going to re-emerge and be a topic of discussion throughout the legislative session.”
The 2027 ETF, which would go into effect on Oct. 1, would be the largest in nominal terms in state history. But the increase would leave many programs in the ETF — including the RAISE Act and money for English language learners would remain level funded. Ivey’s proposal would increase funding for the state’s Pre-K program by about $12.4 million, a 6.2% increase.

In the General Fund, Ivey proposes keeping all programs — including Medicaid, the Department of Human Resources and the Alabama Department of Public Health — level funded.
Kirk Fulford, legislative fiscal officer, told legislators Wednesday that Alabama $203.4 million was awarded by the federal government  through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act for rural healthcare transformation. 
“We have to go back and apply to them and tell them how we plan to actually spend that $203.4 million within that original plan,” Fulford said. “They’re also going to hold our hand and watch every expenditure of the dollars and make sure that they agree with it and approve with how it’s coming down the line, where it’s going.”
Fulford said one reason to budget conservatively for 2027 is what he expects to be a difficult 2028. 
“There’s other things that you’re going to be forced to assume liability on,” Fulford said. “There’s going to be a rock fight in 2028. Keep your head down, and watch where it goes, but it’s going to be a tough one.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/709A5400-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-14 15:57:47.886831

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
The House Education Committee on Wednesday advanced its chamber’s omnibus public education overhaul — but only by a few votes. 
It signals the battle to expand school choice in Mississippi, including spending millions of tax dollars on private schooling – Republican House Speaker Jason White’s pet issue this session – is far from over. Senate leaders have said the House bill is a nonstarter, and White has had to wrangle with reluctance or opposition from some of his own Republican caucus in the House.
But the school-choice movement has gained momentum in Mississippi, thanks in part to efforts from national think tanks and mounting pressure from the Trump administration. School choice refers to a number of policies that fund education outside of the public school system with public dollars in the name of giving parents more power over children’s education. 


Watch the full committee meeting here.

The House’s expansive bill, which came after months of hearings and names White as a principal author, was unveiled Jan. 7. House Bill 2 makes changes across the state’s education system, including adding financial literacy requirements for students, permitting homeschooled students to play public school sports and encouraging prayer in school. 
Most notably, the legislation establishes an education savings account program in Mississippi that would allow students to pay private school tuition with public dollars. It’s the most expansive form of school choice. The bill also makes it easier for students to transfer out of their assigned public school districts, which is called “portability.” It also loosens regulations on where charter schools can expand.
The Republican-led Senate has taken a very limited approach to school choice legislation. The chamber recently passed its own portability bill, and Senate leaders say they won’t consider establishing a voucher program in Mississippi.

Despite intense efforts from White, the House bill doesn’t appear to have overwhelming support. In a small room with posters of A-rated public school districts on the wall, dozens of onlookers watched Wednesday as the panel debated the 553-page bill for over an hour, demonstrating clear discord in the chamber. 
In particular, Republican House Education Committee Chairman Rob Roberson and Rep. Cheikh Taylor, chairman of the Mississippi Democratic Party, both heavy hitters in their respective parties and both from Starkville, lobbed questions back and forth, representing the ideological divide over school choice. 
“If we divert these funds from public education, we’re also diverting funds from the entire philosophy that gives advancements to most families,” Taylor said. “That’s problematic because I don’t see any remedy to replace the funds going to public schools. So I have a ton of heartburn.”
Roberson argued that the money should be going toward educating children, no matter where they attend school, and that parents have students’ best interests in mind, not the government. 
“This bill is not the end all to fix all for schools, never has been,” he said. “It is a piece of a puzzle that we need to continue working on. Public schools, or schools in general in this state, have to continue being looked at, and we need to keep promoting and putting money into these systems.”
But Roberson has previously brushed the argument aside that public schools continue to struggle because of historic underfunding. 
The state’s public-school system has been nationally lauded for its reading improvements in recent years. House Democrats questioned why Republicans would want to make changes to the education system now, after the public school system has found surer footing. 
“Anytime you raise the standard, the water that comes into any system … makes all ships rise,” Roberson said.

Rep. Jansen Owen, a Republican from Poplarville who c0authored the bill, teamed up with Roberson to defend it in committee and echoed the free-market idea that proponents often use to promote school choice. They argue that more schooling options means public schools will have to improve in order to keep students. 
In some places, research shows that addition of charter schools has slightly raised the performance of public schools.

The panel of lawmakers also voted to modify two portions of the original bill during the committee meeting. 
The original bill allowed charter school establishment in any district without regard for the local public school district’s rating. But after amendments on Wednesday, the new bill limits new charter schools to areas with D- or F-rated schools. Current law only allows new charter schools in areas with D- or F-rated districts, so the amended bill would still greatly expand areas charter schools could open statewide. 
Tweaks to the state’s student funding formula were also removed during the committee meeting. Roberson said those changes will be presented in a new bill. 
Harness offered an amendment to strike all of the language in the bill and replace it with a teacher pay raise, but after assurance from Roberson that the House will consider a teacher raise in another bill, he withdrew his amendment. The omnibus bill omits a teacher pay raise, though it includes one for assistant teachers. Roberson said this was an intentional decision to avoid political bargaining over teachers’ livelihoods.
The Senate approved a teacher pay raise last week.
After Republican Rep. Kevin Felsher of Biloxi encouraged the committee to advance the measure so the full body of the House could debate it, representatives revealed their votes one-by-one, thanks to a roll call vote request from Rep. Percy Watson, a Democrat from Hattiesburg. 
The bill passed the committee 14-11. Two lawmakers were absent, and two Republicans — House Education Committee Vice-Chairman Kent McCarty from Hattiesburg and Rep. Dana McLean from Columbus — voted against the measure. 
It can now be brought up on the House floor, and will likely be debated by the full chamber by the end of the week. The vote, despite White’s best efforts, could be tight. 
Felsher acknowledged during the meeting that the bill was imperfect and said that while he voted for the measure in committee, he is not certain how he will vote when it comes before the full House.
“I was committed to moving the bill out of the Education Committee to the floor for further discussion,” he said. “I am still deliberating.” 
Owen said he expects there will be lots of attempts to amend the bill when it comes before the full House. But he said the House leadership is not open to further amendments at this point. 
“All of the amendments we intended to make, we made in the committee substitute,” Owen said. “Everything is where it needs to be at this point.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/14133615/House-Education-Committee-3.jpg,,,2026-01-14 15:57:47.886831

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust announced millions in grants Wednesday to expand patient access to trained doctors and cancer treatments. 
The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences regents and the Oklahoma State University Medical Center were the largest recipients, being awarded $25 million and $30 million respectively, receiving over 36% of all funding awarded. 
The OSU Medical Center will use its funding to develop a new facility for graduate medical education with a goal of creating 100 more physician residency positions, supported by the TSET grant. 
Oklahoma has a shortage of health care providers, especially in rural areas, according to Metriatch, an Oklahoma-focused research and policy organization. 
Increasing the number of available residencies in Oklahoma is important because, according to the American Medical Association, a majority of physicians who complete their residency training choose to practice in the state where they were trained, varying by location and specialty. 
“Oklahomans deserve not only the ability to see a health care provider, but they deserve a well trained provider,” said Dr. Mike Herndon, a member of the OSU Medical Authority and Trust. “And they deserve a provider that is convenient and close to them and can do it in a timely manner. So this grant helps us to provide that very access and that ability.”
OU Health Sciences will use the $25 million grant to support construction of a new location of the Stephenson Cancer facility in Tulsa, which officials said will increase access to cancer treatments in northeast Oklahoma. 
Dr. Gary Raskob, provost for the OU Health campus, said that “few challenges are more urgent than cancer” in Oklahoma and the support of the TSET grant will bring greater access to treatments and clinical trials. 
“This is not a little satellite expansion,” he said. “This is a full fledged facility that will provide the range of services that patients can get here in Oklahoma City, including all these phases of clinical trials, so that patients across northeastern Oklahoma have the same opportunities for cutting edge life saving care.”
Julie Bisbee, executive director of TSET, said the group is able to award larger grants as the endowment has “matured” since its creation. 
Oklahoma voters approved a constitutional amendment to create TSET in 2000, the only state to do so with the funds from a nationwide settlement agreement with tobacco companies. The entity oversees nearly $2 billion in public dollars and uses the endowment earnings to improve health outcomes in Oklahoma. 
“The focus that we have with our legacy grants is on durable capacity, facilities, workforce, systems change that improve outcomes over time and help Oklahomans live healthier lives,” Bisbee said.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)FRANKFORT — Adults who groom children for sex would be subject to criminal charges under a bill proposed in the Kentucky General Assembly, closing a legal gap that let certain perpetrators go unpunished. 
House Bill 4 proposes a range of charges for adults, 18 and older, who groom children with an “intent to entice, coerce, solicit, or prepare the minor to engage in sexual conduct with the person or another person.” 
Up until now, law enforcement has had to wait to charge groomers until they specifically solicited or assaulted a child, Louis Kelly, the commonwealth’s attorney in Boone and Gallatin counties, said during a Wednesday press conference. 
“Crimes are very specific, and sometimes it’s hard to create laws that capture all the behavior that we would want to deter,” Kelly said. “Recently we found … a big gap in behavior that doesn’t rise to the level of an actual sexual solicitation or doesn’t result in a sexual touch or assault, but is nevertheless clearly inappropriate and clearly designed to lead to such things.” 
Sponsor Rep. Marianne Proctor, R-Union, said she wants to stop “any pedophile” from hurting and manipulating children. “I would love (it) if we get 100% of them,” she said.
House Speaker David Osborne, R-Prospect, told reporters Wednesday that the bill is “clearly a priority.” 
“I think anything that we can do to protect the kids in the commonwealth is a good thing,” he said. 
Rep. Kim Banta, R-Ft. Mitchell, is a cosponsor.

What’s in the bill? 
The bill has two tiers for both adults who groom children under the age of 14 and those in positions of “authority or position of special trust” — such as coaches or teachers — who groom children under the age of 18. 
The first tier is a Class A misdemeanor, unless the minor is younger than 12 years old, in which case it is a Class D felony, according to the bill. For those in trusted positions, grooming a minor is a Class D felony unless the minor is younger than 12, in which case it is a Class C felony.

The bill lays out exceptions for “lawful or legitimate” communications, including:

Teaching curriculum on human sexuality or sexually transmitted diseases. 
The use of a traceable communication system by a school district employee. 
The diagnosis or treatment of a minor by a health care provider in a health care facility. 
Age-appropriate conversations about puberty and human sexuality with a minor by the minor’s parent or guardian. 
Communicating with a minor to determine if the minor is dependent, neglected or abused. 
Any conversation with a minor that is part of a person’s job-related duties. 

“It has been well crafted to not criminalize good faith and perhaps innocent discussions between adults and minors, even if, perhaps, misguided,” Kelly said. “This has a high burden on law enforcement and a high burden on prosecution to make sure we are targeting people who should know better, who shouldn’t be doing this and are clearly doing it for inappropriate reasons.” 
The bill requires at least two instances of grooming behavior before charges could be brought.
“It’s got to be a pattern of behavior,” Proctor said. “There’s some things you just see it when you see it. So this is a high bar. This is an intent bill. You’ve got to prove intent.” 
Should Kentucky codify this proposal into law, Proctor said, Kentucky would be one of 13 states with similar statutes. 
Why does this legislation matter? 
Shannon Moody, Kentucky Youth Advocates’ chief officer of strategic initiatives, told the Lantern that grooming is often subtle and rooted in a facade of kindness that can confuse children. And, she said, it often leads to abuse. 
Shannon Moody
“We see a lot of individuals who target kids with difficult home life, and especially kids who maybe feel lonely or isolated,” Moody said. “There’s a lot of perpetrators who identify children with histories where they’re not feeling connected to an adult, and see that as an opportunity.” 
Grooming does not just harm children during their childhoods, Moody said. It can set them up for a pattern of  unhealthy relationships throughout their lives. 
“One of the things that would worry me, if somebody’s experiencing grooming and that behavior is being normalized, is that it starts to normalize bad relationship patterns that you think are okay,” Moody said. “There’s a potential for increased likelihood of experiencing domestic violence or intimate partner violence. It could open the door for somebody to not really understand that that treatment is not okay, and understand what normal relationships should look like.” 
Kentucky has higher rates of domestic violence than the national average: 48% of Kentucky women will experience intimate partner violence or stalking, compared with 47% nationally, the Lantern has reported. About 52% of men in Kentucky will also experience this, which is higher than the national percentage of 44%.

The definition of “grooming behavior” is vague because it is subtle and varied, Moody said. 
“That’s what’s kind of scary about that,” she said. “It sometimes happens before you even know it.” 
Jordan Turner, the Boone County attorney, said grooming “looks so different when we’re talking about victims who are children versus victims who are adults.” State law already covers behavior that targets adult Kentuckians, she said, such as stalking and harassment. 
“Grooming toward children looks like building relationships, being kind, making children trust you,” she said. “I think the fact that we are calling this out, and we are naming it, is a big success at this point.” 



Grooming red flags 
Grooming can vary person to person, Moody said, but there are some signs parents and children can be aware of that may indicate a problem:

If an adult asks the child to keep secrets about the relationship. 
If an adult attempts to isolate the child from their friends. 
If an adult threatens the child with harm if they do not comply with a request. 
If an interaction with an adult makes the child feel physiologically unwell. 
If a child is coming home with items of value that peers are unlikely to be able to afford. This may indicate gifts from an adult.

Dan McKeon of Amherst resigned from the Nebraska Legislature over allegations of workplace misconduct, Gov. Jim Pillen appointed Fred Meyer of St. Paul to represent Legislative District 41.
Meyer is familiar with the Legislature, having served in the same seat during the 2024 legislative session. Pillen appointed him then to replace Tom Briese, whom Pillen appointed as State Treasurer.
Pillen said it was important for him to fill the seat for LD 41 as soon as possible, and he did not follow an application process. He said Meyer will begin serving in the Legislature on Thursday.
“He’ll be an asset from day one,” Pillen said of Meyer.

McKeon resigned Tuesday, minutes before floor debate on his potential expulsion was set to begin. He faced possible expulsion following allegations that he inappropriately touched a legislative staffer.
Had he not resigned, multiple senators corroborated, there were enough votes to expel him, which would have been a first in Nebraska history.
McKeon was cited with misdemeanor public indecency in October, stemming from a separate criminal investigation of the same incident. Prosecutors have since charged him with misdemeanor disturbing the peace. McKeon pleaded not guilty after originally signaling his intent to plead no contest.
His next court date is Jan. 26.
Meyer said he hoped stepping in would put the situation “in the rearview mirror.”
“In my opinion, we’re starting fresh today,” Meyer said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
After Meyer’s legislative service ended in 2024, he said he had no plans to return to the Legislature. As recently as three weeks ago, Meyer told people he wouldn’t be the one to replace McKeon, because he was comfortable in his “semi-retired” home life.
That changed about 10 days ago when he received a call from Pillen, he said.

“Coach Pillen started looking down his bench, and there was one guy at the end of the bench who didn’t want to make eye contact with him,” Meyer said. “And he said, ‘Meyer, you’re in the game.’ So that’s why I’m here today, because I believe, once you’re in the game, then you give it your all.”
Later this year, the state will hold a special election to determine who will serve the remaining two years of McKeon’s four-year term. When Meyer was first appointed to serve in the final year of Briese’s term, he promised not to run for election.
This time around, Meyer was non-committal about his plans for the special election or beyond.
Meyer will enter the Legislature with four days remaining to introduce new bills. Meyer does not intend to introduce new bills himself in a short, 60-day session, saying there are already too many bills at play.
“If it were up to me, I would limit that dramatically,” Meyer said.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Union leader Jake Lowen told the hundreds of workers who gathered Wednesday in the first floor rotunda of the Statehouse to look around and take in “the house that labor built.”
He referenced the stonemasons who cut every piece of limestone in the walls. The iron and steel workers who raised the dome, with the help of operating engineers who ran the hoists built by machinists. Plumbers, boilermakers and electricians brought light, heat and water.
Lowen, the executive secretary-treasurer of the Kansas State AFL-CIO, said some of the workers who started building the Statehouse, which took 37 years to construct, never saw it finished. At least seven gave their lives in the process, he said.
“The work was hard and the price was high, and yet they persevered,” he told the crowd that was gathered for an annual “solidarity day” labor rally.
He said the workers were building a Statehouse by day and a movement by night. In 1890, the year they raised the Statehouse dome, workers formed the Kansas State Federation of Labor, he said.
It wasn’t just the building, he said. Kansas itself was built by working people: farmers who broke open the prairie, railroad workers who connected the state to the rest of the country, teachers who educated generations, nurses who healed, firefighters who kept people safe, construction workers who raised cities from the plains, and machinists who made the state a powerhouse of aviation.
The work, he said, is never finished.
“Every right we have, from the weekend to the eight-hour workday to the safety standards that bring you home alive at the end of your shift, somebody built that brick by brick, contract by contract and fight by fight. This is what you built,” Lowen said.
Sometimes, he said, the Statehouse can feel like a building for “other people, fancy people, people in suits.”
“But you know what? This is your house. This is your state,” he said.
Right now, he added, there are people “in offices upstairs” who want to tear down what they have built. They want to rig congressional maps to silence voices, drain money from public schools to subsidize private ones, and “they’re coming for what’s left of our right to organize,” he said.
“They think that we forgot how to build,” Lowen said. “They think that we’re too divided, too tired and too beaten down. But here’s what they don’t understand. We’re still here in the same building that our people raised with their hands, doing the same work that our founders started, and we will be here long after these walls have crumbled.”

‘I didn’t give you the finger’
Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly told the crowd that organized labor was instrumental to the state’s economic growth under her administration, which included 1,600 new development projects that total more than $30 billion in new capital investment and created 82,000 new jobs.
She said her administration invested in workers, prioritized economic opportunities and ensured that labor had a seat at the table. She created an apprenticeship office and signed an overhaul of the workers compensation system, which included raising benefit caps.
“I walked the picket line with UAW workers,” Kelly said, pausing for applause before ad-libbing, “and I didn’t give you the finger, either.”
She was referring to President Trump’s gesture at a union autoworker at a Ford Motor Co. plant Tuesday in Dearborn, Michigan.
The line was met by howls from the audience, but her biggest applause came when she promised to fight for raising the minimum wage. The state’s minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.

(Courtesy of BorderPlex Digital Assets)As controversial proposals to power multi-billion dollar data centers in southern New Mexico wind through the courts and permitting processes, one state senator aims to close what he considers a loophole that could allow the projects to bypass the state’s clean energy requirements.
This week, state Sen. Jeff Steinborn (D-Las Cruces) introduced a draft bill that would empower state regulators to have approval powers and set new rules for the on site power grids — often called microgrids — and require these private power sources to follow the landmark Energy Transition Act.
A “microgrid” describes developments that generate electricity without drawing from a larger power company’s grid.
These projects currently are not bound by requirements to generate power with cleaner energy sources and face less scrutiny by the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission, Steinborn said in a call with Source NM this week.
“It’s a path to having very dirty energy for these massive data centers rather than using more renewable energy as we require full public utilities,” Steinborn said. “Microgrids pose a threat to the climate and New Mexico’s air quality if we don’t establish minimum renewable energy and other standards regarding water efficiency.”
In public meetings and statements, representatives of Project Jupiter said the microgrid will comply with the state’s law to use fully renewable energy sources by 2045. But state lawmakers disagree on whether a last-minute floor amendment to House Bill 93 passed in the 2025 legislative session allows for “microgrid” developments to circumvent sequential goals laid out in the law.
Steinborn’s bill, if adopted, would require the PRC to put forward new rules for any microgrid producing more than 20 megawatts, enough to power more than 16,000 homes.
The bill would grant regulators oversight over the approval and operation of microgrids and require proof from any microgrid slated to come online after May 2026 of its ability to meet the state’s renewable energy standards. Those standards require 40% percent of a microgrid’s  power generation to come from renewable sources by 2028; 50% clean power generation by 2030; and 100% clean power by 2040.
Additionally, the bill would require microgrid operators to submit annual reports after 2027 detailing how much power they generate; water usage and compliance with state laws.
Project Jupiter, a data center proposed for southern Doña Ana County, would emit as many greenhouse gasses as Albuquerque and Las Cruces combined. Applications submitted to state officials include two natural gas generating stations — the microgrid to power the project — which are projected to generate as much electricity as the entire PNM system.
Project Jupiter’s plan relies on natural gas — its impact on air quality remains unclear

In addition to raising emissions, the project threatens air quality in an area already impacted by ozone and other pollutants, said Las Cruces environmental lawyer David Baake in a statement.
“New Mexico continues to struggle with serious air pollution problems driven by the combustion of dirty fossil fuels,” Baake said. Steinborn’s bill, he said, “protects public health and the climate by ensuring that AI data centers take advantage of our state’s abundant renewable energy resources instead of building more dirty fossil fuel power plants.”
Steinborn said Project Jupiter initially spurred the bill, but pointed to another data center in Lea County with a planned microgrid with gas and nuclear power plants, as signs of a bigger issue.
“Project Jupiter started it, but then it became very clear that this is part of the bigger, maybe even strategy, of some in our state government to bring in lots of data centers into the state,” he said. “Their strategies collectively seem to be that they don’t have to follow any environmental renewable energy standards, so I’m concerned not only for what’s been announced, but what’s in line behind it.”
He continued: “It’s an ecological disaster in the making, quite frankly, that we need to address.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-14 20:00:10+00:00,CT Mirror,Rep. John Larson joins effort to impeach DHS Sec. Kristi Noem,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/14/larson-impeach-kristi-noem/,U.S. Rep. John Larson joined a number of House Democrats supporting impeachment efforts against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.,"U.S. Rep. John Larson, D-1st District, joined a growing number of House Democrats on Wednesday supporting impeachment efforts against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in the wake of the fatal shooting by a federal agent in Minneapolis.
A group of Democrats filed three articles of impeachment against Noem for high crimes and misdemeanors, accusing her of obstructing Congress, violating public trust and self-dealing. DHS oversees U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, also referred to as ICE.
Democrats have limited leverage to enact reforms or push back against DHS since they serve in the minority in Congress. But there is growing pressure from the party’s base to try and rein in the Trump administration over immigration enforcement. That hit a fever pitch after an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis last week.
Larson joined an initial group of 53 House Democrats supporting the articles of impeachment. U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois, who spearheaded the effort, said the number continues to grow, reaching almost 70 members by late Wednesday morning. 
Larson, who faces his most competitive primary since his first election in 1998, is so far the only member of Connecticut’s House delegation to sign on to the effort. The Hartford-area congressman argued that, under Noem’s leadership, ICE has morphed into “President Trump’s secret police force.”
“After a week of lies, cover-ups, and excessive force against peaceful protesters across the country, including the execution of an American citizen, enough is enough,” Larson said in a statement on Wednesday.
“Secretary Noem has lost the trust of the American people and must face accountability for her failed leadership,” he continued. “I am in full support of impeachment proceedings that include a full, transparent investigation into the lawlessness occurring on her watch.” 
Larson specifically cited the killing of Good and the protests that have emerged in response.
Last week in Hartford, at least one person was knocked down by a vehicle and half a dozen were pepper-sprayed during a vigil for Good. Hartford police and DHS have since launched an investigation. A couple of days later, more than 100 people gathered in Fairfield as part of a nationwide “ICE Out For Good” protests.
But the articles of impeachment levied against Noem lay out a list of accusations.
On obstruction of Congress, they allege the DHS secretary prevented Congress from oversight of ICE, which they argue violates the law since the department cannot use congressionally appropriated funds to block lawmakers from getting into ICE facilities. On violation of public trust, they accused her of undermining American citizens’ due process rights by making arrests without warrants. And on self-dealing, members pointed to DHS not using the customary bidding process surrounding an ad campaign.
A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson called the Democratic effort “silly during a serious time.”
“As ICE officers are facing a 1,300% increase in assaults against them, Rep. Kelly is more focused on showmanship and fundraising clicks than actually cleaning up her crime-ridden Chicago district,” the DHS spokesperson said. “We hope she would get serious about doing her job to protect American people, which is what this Department is doing under Secretary Noem.”
There was a recent impeachment attempt aimed at President Donald Trump, who was twice impeached and acquitted during his first term — a Democratic resolution to impeach Trump failed in December. Larson and U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District, voted against the Republican motion to block the impeachment resolution, while the rest of Connecticut’s delegation voted present.
While the latest push against Noem is largely symbolic, Democrats believe it’s worth pursuing even as the odds are stacked against them.
“If you believe impeachment is silly, then you are not taking your job or our Constitution seriously,” Kelly said at a press conference.
Whether aimed at the president himself or his Cabinet officials, any impeachment efforts in the current Congress are expected to stall because Republicans have the votes to block it. But that could change if Democrats win back the House majority in the November midterm elections — something even Trump recently acknowledged as possible if Republicans lose control.
“The House will make their own determination, but I don’t think it’s any secret that the president’s level of corruption and illegality is nuclear-grade in his second term compared to his first term,” U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press” when asked about a potential impeachment against Trump. As a senator, Murphy would sit as a juror on any impeachment trial.
Still, such an effort would likely face hurdles in the Senate, which would hold a trial if the articles of impeachment passed out of the House. Two-thirds of senators would need to vote in order to convict a president, a high bar to meet regardless of which party controls the Senate.
While impeachment is one avenue for Democrats, the party is also weighing potential reforms for ICE as they work out the fiscal year 2026 funding for DHS. Lawmakers need to meet a Jan. 30 deadline to fund the rest of the federal government and avoid a partial shutdown.
As they continue negotiations on the DHS bill, Democrats are currently weighing how to address ICE, whether it’s through attaching policy priorities or adjusting its funding in the forthcoming spending bill.
“You should demand that we make sure that this appropriations process is used to make ICE comply with the law,” Murphy, who is the top Democrat on the Homeland Security appropriations subcommittee, said at a Tuesday night protest in Washington, D.C., according to TIME. “And I see a lot of signs out there — not one additional dime for ICE in this budget.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25273738975767-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-14 15:57:47.886831

WILMINGTON, Del. — SilverAssist, a national senior assistance network, has acquired Caring LLC, the parent company of Caring.com, in a move aimed at simplifying how caregivers and families — including those in Delaware — find, evaluate, and pay for senior care.
The acquisition, announced Jan. 12, brings Caring.com, one of the nation’s most visited online platforms for senior care reviews and referrals, into SilverAssist’s growing portfolio, which already includes Oasis Senior Advisors and ElderLife Financial. Financial terms were not disclosed.
SilverAssist describes the move as creating one of the fastest-growing referral and advisory networks in senior housing, combining digital reach, local expertise and financial navigation under a single umbrella.
For Delaware caregivers, the acquisition is intended to reduce the fragmented, often overwhelming process of searching for senior living or in-home care options.
“Families often move between multiple websites, advisors, and financial tools when a loved one needs care,” SilverAssist said in a statement. “This integration is designed to bring those resources together in one place.”
Caring.com is widely used by families researching assisted living, memory care, nursing homes and home care services. The site offers educational content, family reviews and a referral helpline staffed by care advisors. Under SilverAssist, those digital resources will now connect more directly to local, on-the-ground support.
That local component comes through Oasis Senior Advisors, a national network of Certified Senior Advisors who provide free, personalized guidance to families. Oasis has an established presence in Delaware, including advisors based in Hockessin who work directly with caregivers to assess needs, tour communities and identify appropriate care options.
Lynn Paxson, president of Oasis Senior Advisors of Delaware, said the acquisition has the potential to make the caregiving journey significantly easier for local families.
“Caregivers often come to us stressed, exhausted and unsure where to start,” Paxson said. “By connecting Caring.com’s trusted online information directly to local advisors who understand the Delaware market, we can help families move more quickly from confusion to clarity — and from research to real solutions.”
Paxson said the integration allows caregivers to begin their search online and transition seamlessly to one-on-one, local guidance without repeating their story or starting over.
“That continuity matters,” she said. “It means fewer phone calls, less second-guessing, and more confidence that families are making the right decision for their loved one.”
The acquisition also brings ElderLife Financial more directly into the caregiver experience. ElderLife provides financial tools to help families manage the cost of senior care, including bridge loans, real estate-based funding solutions, and assistance navigating veterans’ benefits.
That financial guidance is particularly relevant in Delaware, where monthly assisted living costs can range from roughly $5,000 to $7,000 depending on location and level of care. Caregivers frequently cite affordability and timing as major obstacles when a health event forces rapid decisions.
SilverAssist said the combined platform will allow families to move from education to placement to financial planning without starting over at each step. Services remain free for caregivers, with revenue generated through partnerships with senior living providers.
The company also said the acquisition is expected to improve occupancy solutions for senior living operators by delivering better-qualified referrals — families who are more informed, financially prepared, and matched to appropriate levels of care.
Integration of Caring.com into the SilverAssist network is already underway, with additional enhancements expected over the coming months.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Generated-Image-January-14-2026-2_55PM.png,,,2026-01-14 15:57:47.886831

A little before 4:30 p.m., Senior High went into lockdown after school district officials say a teacher was attacked by a student who had a knife. Billings Police confirmed that two people were taken to an area hospital.
Lt. Samantha Puckett on Wednesday said the department is not releasing any other information, but that all people involved have been accounted for, and there is no threat to the public. She told the Daily Montanan it is still an active investigation.
The incident happened after class on the third floor of the high school, which serves approximately 1,600 students.
School officials cancelled school and activities on Tuesday night and Wednesday, although they said there is no ongoing threat to the public. Students there begin finals on Thursday.
On Tuesday, there was a girls and boys wrestling meet scheduled as well as an orchestra concert that was cancelled.
Police are still investigating the scene and the motives, while school district officials said there will be crisis counselors available for students and staff on Thursday.
All other schools and activities for Billings Public Schools will proceed as planned.
 



  Message from Billings Public Schools 

Dear Billings Public Schools Community,
We are writing to provide an update regarding an incident that occurred at Senior High School this afternoon, January 13th. At approximately 4:23 PM, after regular school hours, a teacher was attacked and sustained stab wounds.
School staff immediately notified 911 and placed the building into a lockdown. We are relieved to report that the teacher is currently in stable condition and receiving medical care. Law enforcement has confirmed that all parties involved have been accounted for and there is no ongoing threat to the public. As this is an active criminal investigation, the District is working closely with the Billings Police Department.
All classes and extracurricular activities at Senior High School are canceled for Wednesday, January 14th. When students and staff return to the building on Thursday, we will have a crisis support team and counselors available all day to help our school community process this news. Out of respect for the privacy of our staff member and the integrity of the police investigation, we are unable to share further details at this time.
Our thoughts are with our colleague and their family during this difficult time. Thank you for your continued support and for keeping our Senior High community in your thoughts.

The State Department, in a social media post, listed several that would be affected, including Somalia, Haiti, Iran and Eritrea.“The State Department will pause immigrant visa processing from 75 countries whose migrants take welfare from the American people at unacceptable rates,” the State Department wrote. “The freeze will remain active until the U.S. can ensure that new immigrants will not extract wealth from the American people.”It will take effect Jan. 21 and other countries affected include Afghanistan and Russia, according to The Associated Press.The Department of Homeland Security in November published a notice for proposed rulemaking that outlined major changes to how immigration officials assess whether certain immigrants are likely to become a public charge and if that constitutes grounds for inadmissibility, meaning a noncitizen would be ineligible for admission or adjustment of their immigration status.During President Donald Trump’s first administration, he tried to broaden the definition of public charge to include any immigrant who had received certain public benefits for more than 12 months in a 36-month period. The move was tied up in the courts.One of the earliest federal immigration laws is an 1882 law that barred the immigration of people to the U.S. if they were likely to become a public charge.

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul said that Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s large presence in Minnesota, which has resulted in the shooting death of one resident and numerous clashes between community members and federal agents, is not the right way to make communities safe. 
Speaking at the Wisconsin Farmers Union’s annual lobby day Wednesday morning, Kaul said he’s concerned about the federal government “obstructing” the investigation into the death of Minneapolis resident Renee Nicole Good, touted his office’s briefs in support of jurisdictions suing to get federal personnel out of cities and said he’s preparing for similar federal actions in Wisconsin. 
“What’s happening in Minneapolis now could very well be repeated in other communities around the country,” he said. “And so making sure that we’re prepared if that does happen is really important to me.”
He said that targeting people based on their race, ethnicity and political beliefs weaponizes the justice system in a way that makes communities less safe. 
“We do a lot of thinking about public safety at the Department of Justice, it is my top priority,” he said. “Taking actions that strengthen communities, that strengthen community ties, that build trust, that ensure that laws are evenhandedly enforced … and ensure that people who commit serious crimes are held accountable” is the Wisconsin DOJ’s focus, Kaul said.
“If you start targeting people based on any number of inappropriate factors, whether it’s their race or ethnicity or their viewpoint on political issues or any other inappropriate topic, that takes you away from the kind of law enforcement that makes a positive impact and makes communities safer,” he added. 
Kaul noted he’s worked often with Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and said that the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension needs to be involved in the investigation so there is transparency for everyone involved. 
“I’m very concerned that Minnesota BCA has so far been excluded from the investigative process into the death that happened,” he said. “It is critically important that there be transparency and that there be fairness. That, by the way, is important for everybody involved. If you were an officer involved in a critical incident, you deserve to have a fair investigation conducted so that the public knows what happened in that case, because without a fair, transparent investigation, there’s going to be uncertainty.”
“There’s been reporting recently that the FBI is not investigating necessarily the incident, but rather the wife of the woman who was killed,” he added later. “There’s the fact that six Assistant U.S. Attorneys, six federal prosecutors, have resigned in Minnesota because of the way that that investigation is being conducted. And I think it is really important that we distinguish between good faith efforts to get to the truth, that provide information clearly, and what’s going on in Minnesota, because what’s going on right there is obstructing full investigation and full review and risks that we not have information publicly available.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4962-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-14 14:58:11.959867

Jason Knight on Wednesday introduced a resolution condemning “aggressive and violent” enforcement tactics used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current) Rep. Jason Knight on Wednesday introduced a resolution condemning “aggressive and violent” enforcement tactics used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers.
The resolution from the Barrington Democrat condemns the military-style raids and arrests ICE has carried out nationwide since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term in 2025. Knight said the tactics of ICE agents are aimed not at apprehending criminals, but at “scaring people in our community.”
“ICE agents wearing masks are behaving as though they are SWAT teams going after heavily armed drug kingpins when they are, in fact, just snatching ordinary people going to work or bringing their kids to school,” Knight, a candidate for Rhode Island attorney general, said in a statement. “That’s not making communities safer – it’s terrifying them and putting people in danger, particularly those with certain skin colors or accents.” 
Knight pointed to an immigration raid in Warren on Nov. 11, where federal officers arrested a 36-year-old Liberian national who worked at Blount Fine Foods by forcibly removing him from his car. A post on the X account for ICE’s Boston office claimed the man stayed in the country illegally and committed numerous crimes including felony assault with a dangerous weapon forgery, second-degree assault, disorderly conduct and shoplifting.
Knight’s resolution was referred to the House Committee on Judiciary, where he is first vice chair. It has yet to be scheduled for a hearing.
While Rhode Island has been less of a target for large-scale ICE operations, federal immigration officers have become a regular presence outside the state’s courthouses — even briefly detaining a teenage judicial intern outside of the Licht Judicial Complex in Providence on Nov. 20. The judicial intern’s detention sparked widespread outrage among state and local officials.
In a statement emailed to the news media that same day, Chief Justice Paul Suttell called the incident “egregious” and that the Judiciary understands recent calls to expand the use of virtual court hearings in Providence — a call the City Council made in an Oct. 16 resolution.
Knight called ICE’s recent activity an “un-American perversion of justice.” Exacerbating that fear and uncertainty, according to the resolution, is ICE officers’ practice of concealing their identities by wearing masks, sporting plain clothes and driving unmarked vehicles.
“Cruel and unusual detainment tactics and the concealment of ICE agents’ identities are not requisite for effective, comprehensive immigration enforcement or public safety, as prior administrations successfully fulfilled ICE’s mission with comparable levels of deportations while prioritizing known criminals,” the resolution states.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
I wrote this lament, which mentions our beloved Beth Israel, nearly a month ago in the days following the Bondi Beach Hanukkah massacre in Australia. It originally appeared in the Baptist News Global before the attack on the Beth Israel Congregation synagogue in Jackson. As a former Jacksonian, and a friend of Beth Israel, I offer it today, acknowledging the fact that it is timebound to December of 2025 and grieving the fact that it remains, tragically, relevant to January of 2026.
Many mornings, I go on a long, slow, sunrise prayer walk – what the mystics call “goal-less walking” or “life lived at three miles an hour.”
These days, in the neighborhood where I walk, there are a number of delightful inflatable front-yard Christmas decorations: Santas, Rudolphs and Frostys, joined a few days ago by a new, minority inflatable among the many Yuletide blow-ups– a massive, 8-foot-tall Hanukkah bear, complete with a dreidel, a star of David and, of course, a menorah with nine inflated flames, one each for the eight days of Hanukkah, with the taller Shamash candle in the center, from which each of the eight others receive their light.
In other years, I might have walked past the whimsical, inflatable Hanukkah bear with little more than a passing glance. But, needless to say, not this year.
In the aftermath of the Bondi Beach Hanukkah Massacre of five days ago, every time I have passed the huge happy bear holding her HAPPY HANUKKAH sign beneath her brightly burning blow-up candles, I have stood still in the dawn and offered to God a prayer of solidarity with the two Beth Israel synagogues in my life – one in Macon, Georgia, the other in Jackson, Mississippi – and with all Jews in all congregations throughout the world; a sidewalk prayer of solidarity and lament.
Solidarity, lament and repentance.
Whenever there is another act of antisemitic violence, I always think, with deep sadness and quiet repentance, of all the ways the church has sown the bitter seed of bigotry against the Jews.
Hitler did not create the ghetto; we did. It was the church which, as early as the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215, called for Jews to be segregated into confined quarters, the forerunner of the much later Nazi ghettos.

This, of course, came after the forced baptisms, synagogue burnings and massacres of Jews by Christians in the seventh through 11th centuries, and before Martin Luther’s dreadful sermon of 1543 in which he declared that, “Next to the devil, Christians have no enemy more cruel and venomous than a true Jew,” and Pope Paul IV’s declaration in 1555 that, “God has condemned the Jews to eternal slavery”.
All of that antisemitic history was rooted in what I call “Christian onlyism,” the institutionalized arrogance of Christianity’s misguided assumption that we “replaced” Judaism, and that we – conveniently enough for us – are the only religion God recognizes, which has allowed us, at our worst, to dehumanize persons of all other faith traditions, including, especially, the Jews; all of which is all the more inexplicable when we remember that Jesus was, himself, a Jew, not only at his birth but also at his death.
Every Christmas, Jesus is born again in a barn, again, with parents who are Jews, again; parents who will take him to the temple to be dedicated, and, when he is 12, back to the temple for Passover; the same Passover meal he will eat the night before he dies.
And yet, somehow, with a Jesus who never abandoned his lifelong Judaism (and who, as far as we know, never mentioned starting a new world religion called “Christianity”), Christianity helped create the antisemitism which has borne the bitter fruit of anti-Jewish bigotry and persecution, all of which came back to me while watching a row of inflatable pretend Hanukkah lights standing in the heartbreaking Hanukkah shadows of the devastating Hanukkah massacre of last Sunday in Australia; antisemitic violence, not from Christians on Bondi Beach, but, sadly, on so many other times.
So, before the waiting wicks of Hanukkah and Advent wear their last lights for another year, let us say, one more time, for the globe-circling, centuries-spanning church, to the globe-circling, centuries-spanning synagogue, “We are sorry.”
Amen.

Activists ramped up their objections to federal immigration enforcement this week by dropping a bright yellow banner at a Williston business park where a digital surveillance operation run by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials is located.
The banner, spread out across six windows of a building in the White Cap Business Park, read “ICE Violates Rights Here.” It was dropped on the night of Jan. 11 and removed by a cherry picker in the early morning hours of Jan. 12, according to activists who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. 
“ICE is currently using this office to spy on innocent people across the country and identify targets for kidnapping and deportation,” the anonymous activists wrote in a statement sent to VTDigger.

ICE did not respond to a request for comment.
The banner drop came four days after Renee Good, a mother in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was fatally shot by an ICE agent while driving her vehicle on Jan. 7. Protesters gathered in communities across Vermont over the weekend as part of nationwide “ICE Out for Good” vigils. 
Activists who asked to remain anonymous said the banner drop was in response to the death of Good, along with Keith Porter, who was shot by an off-duty ICE agent on New Year’s Eve, and the 32 deaths that have happened in ICE custody since January. 
The killing of Good, a U.S. citizen, took place during what the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has called “the largest immigration enforcement operation ever,” when roughly 2,000 federal agents were sent to Minneapolis earlier this month. During President Donald Trump’s second term, ICE has become the largest and best-funded federal law enforcement agency in the country.

The expansion has led to a growth at ICE offices in Vermont. The Williston facility houses the National Criminal Analysis and Targeting Center, which runs investigations including social media surveillance on the East Coast, while a similar facility, the Pacific Enforcement Response Center in Santa Ana, California, gathers intelligence on the West Coast. Personnel in the offices collect data from publicly accessible sources like social media to help ICE officials target individuals for arrest, according to a federal work order filed in October.
The banner came after a series of noise demonstrations outside the office meant to disrupt ICE surveillance work, according to activists. On an early morning in November, activists sounded their car alarms every 90 seconds, mimicking the rate of ICE arrests that happen every minute and a half, according to a flyer for the event. 
Two more noise demonstrations happened in December — the second captured on a social media account by the Party for Social Liberation — and were organized by other groups including Migrant Justice and the Green Mountain Democratic Socialists of America. Participation in the noise actions has ranged from small groups of 30 to large groups of about 300, according to Vivan Bose-Pyne, a member of the Party for Social Liberation who helped organize the demonstrations but said they were not involved in the banner drop.
“ICE has provided no response,” Bose-Pyne said. “They are aware that with enough public pressure they will not be able to carry out their goals.” 
Bose-Pyne said activists had been talking with building management and tenants, and have been told that ICE has a long-term contract. 
“(We) will continue the pressure on the landlord, the town of Williston and public officials, and the mass public to shut it down,” they said. 
The building is not the first in Vermont that’s been targeted by people dissatisfied with federal immigration enforcement actions.
In October, a Homeland Security building on Harvest Lane in Williston was vandalized with graffiti that included violent phrases like “shoot yourselves” and “die.” The graffiti came about a week after news broke of the department’s plans to expand  digital surveillance in Williston. The Harvest Lane facility was thought to be used by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, according to reporting by The Boston Globe. 
The White Cap Business Park, less than 2 miles from Harvest Lane, also houses the Burlington District Office for the Vermont Department for Children and Families, along with a cafe, a bicycle tour operator, and a gym, among other businesses. 
Protesters have been calling the management agent for the White Cap facility and asking them to cancel the lease. The management agent did not respond to a request for comment before publication.

Lawmakers moved to strip tens of millions of dollars from a Wyoming Department of Health funding increase.
The post Tens of millions denied for Wyoming health department budget appeared first on WyoFile .","CHEYENNE—In a budget markup session Tuesday, the Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee moved to strip tens of millions of dollars in requested fund increases from the Wyoming Department of Health budget.
Led by Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, and members aligned with the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, the JAC’s actions were rooted in a desire to stop the acceleration of government growth, even as some lawmakers warned the cuts could trigger costly lawsuits and harm the state’s most vulnerable citizens.
This division was showcased during the discussion of a $58 million reduction in federal spending authority for the Indian Health Service, a federal program responsible for providing health services and programs for Native Americans. The funds were intended to cover federally mandated All-Inclusive Rate increases for tribal medical facilities. 
Because the money is 100% federal funds, the cut does not save the state’s general fund any money, yet it prevents tribal facilities from receiving the higher reimbursement rates required by the federal government.
The move sparked strong pushback from some committee members. 
Sen. Ogden Driskill, R-Devils Tower, warned that the refusal to adopt mandated rates was a legal land mine.
“Some of these actions are going to lead to lawsuits that probably cost us more money than it does save money,” Driskill said, adding that the state has a constitutional obligation to care for those who cannot care for themselves. “What you’re doing is denying health care. If that’s what you want to do, you own it.”
Sen. Mike Gierau, D-Jackson, echoed these concerns, noting that medical costs are rising for everyone.
“I understand the theory about stopping [government] acceleration … but what you’re doing is, while trying to slow down the train, you’re throwing our tribal members under it,” he said, calling the proposed cuts “draconian.”
Rep. Ken Pendergraft, R-Sheridan, who proposed many of the day’s largest cuts, defended the stance by quoting a Ronald Reagan fiscal philosophy.
“We have become addicted to government intervention, and a lot of people have become dependent upon government,” he said.
Pendergraft argued that his motions were necessary to prevent a future fiscal “wreck” by slamming the brakes on spending increases now.
Chairman Bear supported this view, stating, “Any time you increase spending in government, any time you are putting a burden on the taxpayer … somebody needs to look out for the taxpayer.”
The JAC voted to remove the $58 million in exception funds requested by the health department. The Indian Health Service did not respond to a request for comment before publication time.
This anti-acceleration strategy extended to maternity and OB services. Lawmakers voted to deny an $8.5 million general fund increase and an $8.5 million federal match intended to raise reimbursement rates to 100% of cost for Critical Access Hospitals that maintain labor-and-delivery units.
Driskill criticized the cut as a “death by 1,000 cuts” that would force expecting mothers to deliver in neighboring states like Utah or South Dakota.
“If there’s not maternity care, you’re not going to live in Wyoming,” he said. “… It’s painful to go through withdrawal. It’s also painful to kill your state one piece at a time, and we’re working on that.”
However, Rep. Abby Angelos, R-Gillette, argued that reimbursement rates weren’t the root issue, pointing instead to malpractice insurance costs. She suggested that funding might be found elsewhere, specifically through the Rural Health Transformation Program. At the end of 2025, Wyoming was awarded $205 million in federal funds for the first year of the five-year program.
The committee also approved several other multi-million-dollar cuts, including removing $344 million in federal funds for the Rural Health Transformation Program from the biennium budget, with the intent to run it as an independent bill to ensure legislative oversight.

Senate Bill 7, sponsored by Sen. Aaron Reed, R-Shelbyville, gained a slew of GOP co-sponsors after it was filed Tuesday. Senate Democratic Floor Leader Gerald Neal, of Louisville, is also co-sponsoring the legislation. 
Return to ‘local control’ of driver’s license renewals is a priority for KY Senate GOP

“Unless you have a regional office in your backyard, every one of us has heard the same message from constituents that the current driver’s license system is not meeting the needs of Kentucky,” Reed said. “We have long drives, long lines and repeated delays that have created real frustration across the commonwealth.” 
The bill received unanimous approval in the Senate Transportation Committee after Reed presented it. The committee chairman, Sen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, had appeared with Reed at a Tuesday press conference about the legislation. 
Reed’s bill comes in response to reports of delays in getting appointments at regional offices, extended wait times and long drives to offices for rural Kentuckians. Kentucky has 34 regional offices that issue and renew driver’s licenses. 
Under the legislation, drivers would still have to go to a regional office for an initial license. Counties without a regional office could choose a local official to offer license renewal and duplication services. 
Sen. Greg Elkins, R-Winchester said that his local circuit clerk and county clerk have expressed interest in offering the services. 
“I was concerned that we may not get people that wanted to do it, and that doesn’t seem to be the case,” Elkins added. 
Sen. Gex Williams, R-Verona, noted Neal’s support for the bill along with 27 Republicans and called the legislation “truly a bipartisan bill.”

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-14 18:53:06+00:00,Mississippi Today,Federal proposal could limit loans for nursing grad students. Experts say that could worsen health care staffing shortages in Mississippi,Gwen Dilworth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/14/loans-nursing-grad-students-staff/,"Tomekia Luckett poses for a portrait Tuesday, Jan. 13, 2026, at Southwest Mississippi Community College in Summit, Miss.","Tomekia Luckett’s journey to becoming a mental health nurse practitioner — pursuing a bachelor’s, master’s and doctorate degree while raising triplets — was made possible by federal student loans and scholarships. But she fears proposed new caps on those loans could make the path she took more treacherous for the next generation of nurses.
Beginning in July, graduate students across all disciplines will face stricter limits on federal loans under a provision in last summer’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
The law directed the U.S. Department of Education to identify “professional degree” programs, which will be eligible for higher loan caps. A draft rule released by the agency excludes graduate nursing programs from the designation, a decision that could subject such students to tighter borrowing limits. These programs train nurse practitioners and certified nurse anesthetists, professionals who help fill critical gaps in Mississippi’s physician workforce.
“I am very concerned as a person who was a first-generation college student,” said Luckett, who treats patients across rural southwest Mississippi and has taught nursing for more than a decade. “If those caps had been in place, there would very likely not be a Dr. Luckett today.” 
Luckett, who spoke to Mississippi Today in a personal capacity, serves as the associate dean for nursing continuing professional development at Walden University and as director of the Mississippi Nurses’ Association’s Council on Nursing Education. 
The federal Department of Education plans to finalize the rule classifying professional degree programs “early this year,” according to its website. But experts and advocates warn that the draft rules — which halve the amount of federal student loans nursing students can receive compared to doctors, dentists and lawyers — could create barriers for nurses seeking advanced education and threaten the stability of the nursing workforce nationwide.
“By limiting the loans, that will make it more difficult for people who come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds to be able to afford going to nursing school and a career in nursing,” said Vincent Guilamo-Ramos, a nurse practitioner and executive director of the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing Institute for Policy Solutions. 
Under the draft rules, “professional degree” programs will be capped at a $200,000 borrowing limit. Nursing graduate students would be capped at half that amount — a maximum of $100,000, or $20,500 a year. Current borrowers will be permitted to continue receiving loans under existing rules for three years or the length of their program. 
The Trump administration said not classifying graduate nursing as a  “professional degree” — a decision that has caused outrage among some nurses — is a technical and regulatory decision, not a “value judgement about the importance of programs,” according to a post on the U.S. Department of Education website.
The department said the new caps on loans won’t have a widespread impact, noting that 95% of nursing students borrow below the annual loan limit, according to the agency’s data, and that 80% of the nursing workforce does not have a graduate degree. 
Since 2007, graduate and professional students have been allowed to borrow up to the full cost of attendance through the federal Graduate PLUS program. These changes have allowed schools to inflate their tuition and saddle students with debts, the Trump administration said.
The changes could make the nursing workforce less representative of the people they serve, and contribute to existing health care workforce shortages, Guilamo-Ramos said. Studies show that a representative and diverse health care system improves health outcomes and access to care for patients. Researchers have shown that patients are more likely to receive preventive care they need and agree to recommended care when their doctors have a similar racial or cultural background to them.
Antonia M. Villarruel, the dean of the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing, said in a statement to Mississippi Today she expects the new loan caps to have “devastating effects” on the preparation of graduate-level nurses and nursing educators, and that these limits will contribute to increased shortages of primary care providers, especially in rural areas.
“This impacts both access to care for all Americans and the ability of schools and universities to continue to educate this group of professionals that will result in faculty shortages,” Villarruel said. 
Crystal Joslin, a registered nurse from Corinth who works at a rural hospital and a nursing home, said she aims to advance her career by becoming a psychiatric nurse practitioner. Working shifts at the hospital’s medical-surgical unit and emergency room, she often sees patients with serious mental health needs, and she hopes to further her education to assist her community. 
News of the proposed federal loan caps made her second guess her plan to attend a master’s program at the University of North Alabama later this year. She considered delaying her career plans to save up. But she said she has decided to persist — and will pay the portion of her tuition that is not covered by loans out-of-pocket — in order to help her community and advance her career. 
“I didn’t really want to wait the extra couple of years,” she said. “Of course, my work as an RN, I can definitely be doing that. But I feel like there’s nurses to educate out there, and there’s patients to help. …There’s more things that I could be doing with my education and my knowledge that I wouldn’t be getting to do.”
Critics of the caps argue that while the changes may limit students’ debt, they will also limit students’ access to education.
“It would be nice if I could have less debt, but at the same time, I wouldn’t have the education I have,” Luckett said. 
Guilamo-Ramos said he does not expect universities to lower their tuition as a result of the changes. Nursing education must comply with strict requirements that make programs more costly to run, like student-to-faculty ratios. 
“I think what will happen is that over time just people who can afford to attend will attend,” Guilamo-Ramos said. “And that’s bad for all of us.”
The draft loan caps have generated bipartisan dissent. In a Dec. 12 letter to U.S. Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent, a bipartisan group of nearly 150 congressional lawmakers expressed support for including nursing degrees in the department’s definition of “professional degree.” The effort was spearheaded by several lawmakers, including U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, co-chair of the Senate nursing caucus. 
“At a time when our nation is facing a health care shortage, especially in primary care, now is not the time to cut off the student pipeline to these programs,” wrote the group of U.S. senators and representatives. 
Mississippi has one of the lowest rates of physicians per capita in the nation, and the gap is expected to grow over time. In rural areas, nurse practitioners often fill gaps left when there is not a physician.National research shows that the share of Medicare visits delivered by physician assistants and nurse practitioners nearly doubled between 2013 and 2019. Rural family physicians are more likely to partner with these clinicians to meet patient care needs.
Certified nurse anesthetists also help address critical care shortages, performing about 70% to 90% of procedures compared to their physician counterparts in Mississippi, according to Public Health and Human Services Chairman Rep. Sam Creekmore, a Republican from New Albany, speaking during a House floor session last year. 
Mississippi is currently facing a shortage of nurse anesthetists, and that gap is expected to grow over the next decade, according to data from Health Resources and Service Administration. Today, Mississippi is lacking about 90 needed nurse anesthetists, but by 2035, that figure is expected to grow to 140 — meaning only 76% of needed positions will be filled.
Guilamo-Ramos said he hopes that the new student loan provisions will spur nursing schools to consider ways to make tuition costs affordable for more students apart from loans. 
“Schools of nursing need to take a hard look at the cost of tuition and make it more affordable,” he said. “And we need to improve our scholarships, and we need to improve other kinds of aid besides loans.”
Graduate nursing programs in Mississippi range in cost. The Mississippi University for Women offers one graduate nursing program, for family nurse practitioners. The program costs about $4,300 per semester and takes about three semesters to complete, according to the school’s website. Because the cost of the program is below the cap, the draft rule would not impact students attending this program. 
Brandy Larmon, the dean of the College of Nursing, said the school is assessing the potential risks of the loan caps, but is not currently concerned due to the short length of the program and low cost of attendance. 
Other graduate nursing student programs, and especially nurse anesthesia programs, can be more costly and take more time to complete. The University of Southern Mississippi’s graduate nurse anesthesia program costs about $30,000 annually, according to a spokesperson, and takes three years to complete.
If enacted, Guilamo-Ramos said he expects the proposed caps on student loans to affect advanced practice nurse staffing levels and exacerbate faculty shortages as soon as within the next one to two years. 
He added that the impact could be especially significant in Mississippi and across the South, where workforce shortages are already severe and health outcomes lag behind other regions.
“It worries me deeply that we would be losing nursing workforce in the very places that we need to have more people,” Guilamo-Ramos said.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Supreme Court Chief Justice Susan Christensen asked state lawmakers for support Wednesday in making “difficult” changes to the state judicial branch’s magistrate system and employee compensation structure.
She spoke to a joint session of the Legislature in her annual Condition of the Judiciary address.
Christensen said as she was preparing for her remarks ahead of the 2026 legislative session, there was one major theme she wanted to highlight: Leadership. In the past year, she said she spoke with leaders in the state executive and legislative branches about the issues facing the judicial branch, and the challenges they faced as leaders in Iowa.
“Across every conversation, the message was unmistakable, ‘do what you believe is right, even when it is not popular, and when difficult decisions must be made, explain yourself,'” Christensen said. “That is what I will do today.”
Christensen shared a change made in the state judicial branch in the summer of 2025 — changes to the employment classification and compensation structure. She said the state court administration, working with a consultant, reexamined how the more than 1,500 workers are defined and paid in the current system and made changes which “sparked a lot of grumbling” throughout the system.
The review found while overall compensation was competitive for most positions, it also found roughly a quarter of judicial staff were underpaid compared to comparable government jobs, and roughly 10% were paid at or above what data shows their job and duties receive. Based on these assessments and recommendations made by the consultant, Christiansen said the system reduced job classifications from 140 to 82, standardized pay grades and raised the minimum salary for the 25% of jobs evaluated as underpaid.
However, these changes were not universally popular.
“Change can be uncomfortable, and for some it feels personal,” Christensen said. “But we could no longer ignore a long-standing pay practice that unintentionally favored some while others, often just as dedicated, were underpaid for years. That is difficult to sustain, particularly in a publicly funded system.”
The changes made to the system’s job classification and compensation structure caused both positive impacts — “almost overnight, the number of applicants for judicial branch positions soared,” Christensen said — as well as negative impacts, as many longtime employees were “deeply disappointed by shortened pay ranges or the loss of automatic reclassification based on years of service.”
“We need to work on that,” Christensen said. “Experienced staff is just as important as recruiting new talent.”
The judicial branch is requesting $1 million to address salary compression caused by the recent restructuring, saying this funding will allow the judicial system to more equitably and competitively pay long-term branch employees.
Christensen requests support for revamping magistrate system
The chief justice said the second “monumental decision” the court system took on in the past year was the modernization of Iowa’s magistrate system.
Christensen also brought up a need to change Iowa’s magistrate system in her 2025 address. Magistrates are the part-time judicial officials with the authority to conduct preliminary hearings and issue search warrants. Serving the county they reside in or a neighboring county, these officials, who serve four-year terms, preside over cases including simple misdemeanors, evictions, small claims and involuntary commitment proceedings. For most defendants, a magistrate is the first judicial officer a defendant will see, Christensen said.
While magistrates play an important role in Iowa’s judicial system, Christensen said the branch was proposing reducing the number of required magistrates in the state system. Current Iowa statute requires 206 magistrates statewide, she said, a provision the judicial system proposes eliminating, alongside the requirement that each county is required to have at least one magistrate.
“Today, it no longer reflects the workload reality,” Christensen said. “in fact, we have perhaps 60 more magistrates than the work requires. That is not sustainable.”
Currently in Iowa, these officers appointed to serve four-year terms are expected to devote roughly a third of their professional time to serving the judicial branch, and are free to practice law or earn additional income through other employment during the other two-thirds of their work week. Because of that division, magistrates are paid $46,611 a year — 31% of the pay a judge, who is required to serve on a bench full time and cannot practice law.
However, she said, this pay structure does not make sense, as the workload of the magistrates currently required under Iowa law “means we are paying nearly $600,000 each year in salary and benefit costs for work that does not equal one full-time position.”
The judicial branch’s proposal would assign magistrates to a judicial district rather than a county, and would allow the state court administration to determine how many magistrates are needed in each judicial district and subdistrict based on a county’s case filings and recent time study.  It would also increase the devoted workload for magistrates from one-third of their work week to 40%, or two days, she said. These changes, modeled after the state’s system for trial court judges, would allow the state to more effectively address the needs of Iowa courts, Christensen said.
“Change is never easy,” Christensen said. “But I am confident this is the right step for our courts. With your support, we can streamline and right-size the magistrate system, improve how the work is administered and save a minimum of $2.5 million annually for the judicial branch.”
Judicial pay and indigent defense concerns return
The changes to Iowa’s magistrate system was not the only issue Christensen repeated from previous years’ addresses. She said the issues of judicial pay and indigent defense “remain unresolved” in the state, and will cause problems if not addressed.
“I am committed to bringing up these issues until we move beyond discussion and see meaningful progress,” she said.
Low judicial pay in Iowa is leading to fewer applicants applying for judicial openings across the state, she said, which reduces the quality of applicants filling important roles in Iowa. She pointed to a district court judge opening in April 2025 for District 8A in southeast Iowa, where only two attorneys applied to fill the position.
“Keep in mind, the job of a judicial nominating commission is to review all applicants and send the two most qualified candidates to the governor,” Christensen said. “But when there are only two applicants, it’s a guarantee both are going to the governor, regardless of their resumes, regardless of experience, regardless of temperament.”
She said Iowa is a “whisper away” from having openings where only one applicant applies to fill a position, stripping a judicial nominating commission or the governor of the ability to meaningfully evaluate whether a person is well-suited to fill the position.
Christensen said the state was requesting an increase in pay for judicial officers of at least 4.3% in fiscal year 2027 to cover the cost-of-living growth and recover “at least a portion of the purchasing power judges have lost in recent years.” The funding would result in a total increase of $2,256,477 for judicial officer salaries, according to the state court administration.
This is a decreased request from last year’s proposal, which sought to link district court judges’ salaries to 75% of a federal judge’s salary. This proposal would have amounted to a 10.2% increase in pay, she said.
“We recognize that would be a big step in a single year, but couldn’t we begin to close the gap?”
She also said while indigent defense pay is not a part of the judicial branch’s budget, the underfunding of contract attorneys providing indigent defense “has a profound impact on our courts.” She called for Legislature to take action on this issue, saying “like judicial pay, this isn’t tomorrow’s problem, it’s today’s reality.”
As an example, she brought up a June 1, 2025, criminal complaint in Davenport where a man, who had a prior Operating While Intoxicated conviction and was driving without a license, was arrested for driving the wrong direct on a one-way street by an officer who noted slow, slurred speech and open containers of beer and whiskey in the vehicle. After being arrested, the defended requested and qualified for court-appointed counsel, but there were no attorneys available. After two and a half months, without the appointment of an attorney, his case was dismissed.
“Could this happen in an OWI case that ended up killing someone? Or a sexual abuse case involving a child? Of course it could,” Christensen said. “If we cannot hold criminal defendants accountable, Iowans are at risk. We are playing with fire.”

The post Law enforcement officer faces murder charge for Lander bar fight death  appeared first on WyoFile .","Federal law enforcement officer Richard “Deak” Dollard faces second-degree murder charges for a Friday night fight in a Lander bar that resulted in the death of local resident Evan Denevan, court documents show. 
Two other men, Jesse Dollard and Justin Dollard, were also arrested Tuesday and face accessory to second-degree murder charges. Justin and Richard are brothers. Justin is Jesse’s father. 
Investigators say Richard Dollard is a “certified law enforcement officer.” Lander Police Chief Kelly Waugh told the Lander City Council on Tuesday that Richard Dollard worked for the Bureau of Land Management, according to several reports. A LinkedIn account identifies him as a field staff law enforcement ranger. 
At about 11:15 Friday night, the Lander Police Department received a call about a fight at the Maverick Lounge on Lander’s Main Street. According to investigators’ account of the incident in court affidavits, the caller told police that Denevan was “not breathing, he’s all purple.” 
When officers arrived, they saw Denevan lying on his back in a corner of the lounge near the pool tables, investigators say. Bystanders were trying to render aid to Denevan, and the officers began giving medical care. Officers didn’t feel Denevan’s carotid pulse. Medics arrived, but Denevan ultimately died from his injuries. 
Several witnesses at the scene told officers that Richard Dollard had choked Denevan, the affidavits state. 
Investigators say they reviewed video footage preceding the fight that showed Jesse becoming “visibly upset” and gesturing toward Denevan. The affidavits describe what happened next: 
Bystanders held Jesse Dollard back. Justin Dollard approached Denevan. Denevan removed his hat and glasses. They appeared to argue. Justin Dollard then pushed Denevan in the chest. Denevan fell backward against a wall and then advanced toward Justin Dollard. People tried to separate the two. 
Jesse Dollard then approached Denevan and punched him as Denevan punched back. Bystanders pushed Jesse Dollard back as Justin Dollard advanced and also punched Denevan. 
According to the affidavits, Richard Dollard then approached the area and put his arm around Denevan’s neck, choking him from behind. While Richard Dollard choked Denevan, Justin Dollard was pulling Denevan’s sweatshirt hood over Denevan’s head, moving Denevan’s head and neck in the opposite direction from Richard Dollard’s grip, authorities say. 
Richard Dollard held the choke for roughly 26 to 27 seconds before appearing to fall and release his grip, investigators allege. Denevan fell to the floor. Witnesses said that Justin Dollard then kicked Denevan in the torso. 
The Dollards moved back to the other side of the bar. Jesse Dollard later told detectives that the Dollards “began getting ‘death threats’ and left the area.” None of them tried to help Denevan. 
Justin Dollard told detectives in an interview that Denevan had previously said he would “whip” him and “has threatened to fight” Justin Dollard and his son Jesse Dollard. Justin Dollard said that Denevan began yelling at him and Jesse Dollard, telling them “if you come over here, I will kick your ass.” 
The Lander Police Department worked with the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation and the Fremont County Attorney’s Office to conduct the investigation. Waugh previously told WyoFile that the division became involved to provide more resources and “boots on the ground.”

Ford, D-Indianapolis, speaks with reporters at the Indiana Statehouse on Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2025. (Photo by Tom Davies/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Democratic state Sen. J.D. Ford is aiming for a jump to Congress with a challenge to Republican U.S. Rep. Victoria Spartz.
Ford announced his bid Wednesday for central Indiana’s 5th Congressional District seat, where Spartz is running for a fourth term.
“The fact that we are still dealing with prices that are skyrocketing, the fact that we watched Congress take away health care subsidies for people, that’s going to have a drastic impact,” Ford told reporters. “I just couldn’t sit quietly. I couldn’t stand by the sidelines anymore.” 
Spartz will have the advantage of incumbency in the district that was redrawn to strengthen its Republican lean following her narrow 2020 general election win for her first term.
Spartz easily won the 2024 election following a tight Republican primary victory with 39% of the vote after reversing her previous announcement that she wouldn’t seek reelection.
Spartz’s campaign did not immediately reply to a request for comment Wednesday about Ford’s entry into the race.

Spartz filed her paperwork for reelection on Monday and no prominent Republican primary challengers have emerged.
“Our nation will soon face significant fiscal challenges, and my extensive expertise on fiscal issues and health care will be greatly needed in Congress,” Spartz said in a Monday campaign statement. “Too many people are running for office with corrupt personal agendas and radical policies that have been destructive to our country and undermine President Trump’s conservative agenda, and we cannot allow them to prevail — too many Americans have sacrificed for our freedoms.”
Ford, who is the first and only openly gay member of the General Assembly, will have to give up the legislative seat that he first won in 2018 for a congressional run since his Senate district is also up for election this year. 
Ford said he believed he could make a credible challenge to Spartz, pointing to his success in winning what had long been a Republican Senate district covering northeastern Indianapolis and the Carmel and Zionsville areas.
 “People are going to tell me that the 5th District is unwinnable, I would just tell them, watch me,” Ford said.
He said he was motivated to challenge Spartz during the failed push demanded by Trump for redrawing Indiana’s U.S. House districts, which was supported by Spartz and rest of the state’s Republican congressional delegation.
Todd Shelton of Pendleton, a web development instructor at Indiana University Indianapolis and a veteran, has also filed as a candidate in the Democratic primary.
Ford’s residence in Indianapolis is outside the congressional district, which is not a legal requirement to run for Congress. He told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that he was connected with the congressional district since it included the Carmel portion of his legislative district.
“My commitment is that, when I’m successful, that I will move into the district,” Ford said.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/19F6EA93-7DFF-4E7B-8323-872FA9B0F481_1_201_a-1024x605.jpeg,,,2026-01-14 13:59:50.168611

Robin Kelly. Nearly 70 Democrats have co-signed, but as the minority party in both chambers, any support or movement for the articles will likely only occur if Democrats win the midterm elections and flip the House. “She needs to be held accountable for her actions,” Kelly said. “Renee Nicole Good is dead because Secretary Noem allowed her DHS agents to run amok.”On Jan. 7, 37-year-old Renee Good was shot and killed by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross in Minneapolis. Federal immigration officers have intensified immigration enforcement, leading to massive pushback from the community there and protests across the country. The articles from Kelly accuse Noem of obstructing Congress after lawmakers were denied oversight visits at DHS facilities that hold immigrants; violating public trust through due process violations of U.S. citizens’ and immigrants’ rights and aggressive warrantless arrests in immigration enforcement; and misusing $200 million in taxpayer funds by awarding a contract to a company run by the husband of DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, according to ProPublica.A dozen members of Congress have sued Noem over those denied visits at ICE facilities to conduct oversight and were granted a stay to that policy by a federal judge. But Noem issued a new policy and last weekend several Minnesota lawmakers were blocked from visits to ICE facilities. A federal judge is currently probing to see if the new policy from Noem violates her court order from December. Kelly was joined by several Democrats, including Minnesota’s Angie Craig, who represents a swing district. “We are being terrorized by Homeland Security and ICE,” Craig said. “This has crossed a line. This rogue agency is violating the rights of American citizens in our communities, and last Wednesday … the escalation by ICE in our communities got Renee Good killed.”Noem would not be the only Homeland Secretary to be impeached, should the House take that action. In 2024, Republicans impeached the Biden administration’s DHS secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, on the grounds that he lied to Congress that the southern border was secure and that he violated his duty when he rolled back several Trump-era immigration policies. The Senate, then controlled by Democrats, dismissed the articles of impeachment.",,,,2026-01-14 13:59:50.168611

Doing so could “reduce and avoid ER visits,” Sen. Craig Richardson, R-Hopkinsville, told the Senate Health Services Committee Wednesday morning. 
His proposal, Senate Bill 38, passed unanimously out of the committee and can now go to the floor for a full vote. 
“This bill allows for Medicaid to reimburse pharmacists under their current legal scope of practice for services they already provide,” Richardson said. “And what that will do is, we believe, reduce Medicaid rates by allowing a lower cost provider to have access to patients and members in the community, instead of having them go to emergency rooms.” 
An August 2025 report from the Legislative Research Commission (LRC) found that 90% of Kentuckians live within five miles of a community pharmacy while the state faces a shortage of primary care physicians. 
The state is expected to have a shortage of nearly 3,000 physicians by 2030, according to that report. 
“It is proven through research that a pharmacist will have greater contact with those members in the community than a primary care provider or other other providers,” Richardson said. “We know that this bill, especially in rural Kentucky, will give pharmacists a chance to increase our health care outcomes, lower our Medicaid expenses over, I think, a short term, including a long term, and give us greater access and greater health care outcomes.”

House Bill 2426, she said, would add to the danger those individuals face. (Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A bill that would ban gender changes on Kansas driver’s licenses and birth certificates drew hundreds of opponent comments despite appearing on a committee agenda just 24 hours before the Tuesday hearing. 
The House Judiciary Committee heard public testimony about House Bill 2426, introduced by committee chair Rep. Susan Humphries, R-Wichita, that would make the terms “gender” and “sex” equivalent in state law. 
Opponents asked lawmakers to vote down the bill, citing concerns about the safety and mental health of transgender individuals. Proponents focused on challenges for law enforcement and medical personnel when the gender isn’t correct on the driver’s license.   
Under HB 2426, transgender Kansans would be barred from changing their gender on birth certificates and driver’s licenses. The bill would invalidate documents already issued with new gender markers and require anyone who previously changed their gender to get new documents stating their biological sex at birth. 
People in favor of and against the bill filled the hearing room, with most in favor citing 
Attorney General Kris Kobach, who lost a court case on appeal after defending a 2023 bill that banned gender changes on driver’s licenses, reserved 12 seats in the crowded committee room and spoke first to push for the bill’s passage. 
Kobach walked legislators through what happened with the lawsuit that was overturned on appeal and how this bill would keep the state from returning to court. He also claimed Kansas statutes have “always” used the terms sex and gender interchangeably, a sentiment the Court of Appeals did not agree with.
“Now today, in the midst of the trans issue and the controversies that surround it, sometimes people have taken to using those words as referring to different things, gender referring to a subjective mental assessment of what one is,” Kobach said.
Gender is a social and personal identity or expression, while sex refers to reproductive systems.

Bill proponents
Two medical professionals, retired plastic surgeon Richard Bosshardt, a fellow at Do No Harm, and Wichita physician Michelle Baalmann, spoke in favor of the bill. Do No Harm is a national organization focused on identity politics and its effects on medical care. 
A spokeswoman for the Kansas Catholic Conference, representing the Catholic bishops of Kansas, also spoke in favor of the bill. 
“There are differences in medical emergencies and differential diagnosis of pathologies. Gender does matter,” Baalmann said. “It is like a vital sign when treating a patient, especially in a life-threatening emergency. If we were to remove this from the driver’s license and change it to a subjective choice that the person is making, you’re essentially blinding emergency responders and emergency physicians.”
Bob Stuart, executive officer for the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, told the committee that accurate information on a driver’s license makes the job of law enforcement easier in terms of identification and de-escalating situations. 
“Not having the right sex on a driver’s license is one of those things that makes it more difficult for law enforcement to do their job correctly and to do it safely, not only for law enforcement, but for the subjects that we’re trying to either arrest or clear and let go on their way,” he said. 
Rep. John Carmichael, a Wichita Democrat, questioned the validity of that statement, pointing out that one of his constituents is a transgender male with a full beard. 
“He is, by all appearances, a man,” Carmichael said. “How would putting an F on his driver’s license help you out? … If you look at his picture, you stop him on the road, he gives you his driver’s license. He’s a hairy-faced man. That’s what shows on his driver’s license. That’s what the officer sees in front of them right now. His driver’s license says he’s an M and it all fits together.”
“It helps make the correct decision,” Stuart said, repeating a phrase he had used to answer a previous question. 
Carmichael responded, “That’s the best you can do, Bob, I guess that’s the best you can do.”
The exchange earned an admonition from Humphries to be respectful of people who were testifying.   
 
Opponent testimony
Opponents of the bill were peppered throughout the crowded committee room, and Rep. Brandon Woodard, D-Lenexa, said his office received more than 300 written comments before the hearing. 
Elise and Jay Flatland of Olathe testified about the importance of accurate gender markers for two of their four children, who are transgender. 
“Some people have taken the approach that my kids are confused, that they should fix the wiring,” Jay Flatland said. “There’s no fixing the wiring in my kids. So I want to correct that. I hear that a lot, that these kids are confused and people are confused. It’s not the case.”
A driver’s license is an “artifact of expression” about her gender that makes his daughter feel good, he said. 
“I don’t think we’re emphasizing enough why people want this,” Jay Flatland said. “This is why.” 
Melissa Stiehler, advocacy director for Loud Light Civic Action, spoke against the bill, challenging the idea that being transgender is a “new thing.” 
“This idea that it is one or the other is a fairly isolated worldview,” Stiehler said. “Historically, in Judaism, they have recognized more than just male or female. While that may not be the current modern practice, that goes to show that what is new right now, in this moment in time, is this trans-panic hysteria that’s coming from a small but very vocal minority of narrow-minded proponents.”

@ksreflectorA House Judiciary committee hearing on Kansas House Bill 2426 Tuesday drew a standing room only crowd, including Attorney General Kris Kobach who told the committee he was in favor of the legislation that required Kansans to use their biological sex at birth on driver’s licenses and birth certificates. The bill drew hundreds of written letters in opposition and multiple proponents to testify.♬ original sound – Kansas Reflector



Increasing violence
Stiehler said hate-based violence against transgender individuals has increased 340% since 2015. She and others who testified raised concerns that not allowing gender on the driver’s license to match the appearance of individuals would open them to violence.
“This has become so much of an issue that, because state legislatures such as this one are passing laws based on propaganda, based on misinformation, based on Twitter conspiracy theories – this national trend of legislating based on this is alarming enough that globally renowned scholars have issued a warning this week that the United States is in early stages of genocide against trans Americans,” Stiehler said.
Matthew Obold-Geary, who testified against the bill, said transgender Kansans already face disproportionately higher rates of discrimination, harassment and barriers to health care. 
“Legislation that undermines their legal identity contributes to stigmatize and can exacerbate mental health challenges,” he said. “Bills like this send a message that their identities are not respected or recognized under state law. Thirdly, HB 2426 has some practical problems and some legal uncertainty.”
Obold-Geary questioned how the state would handle the cost of re-issuing driver’s licenses and birth certificates, and the confusion if a person has federal documents with their correct gender but their biological sex at birth on their driver’s license. 
Humphries said the fiscal note for the bill has not been completed. 
 
Rushing through
The hearing was scheduled at 3:58 p.m. Monday, just under the required deadline for giving notice, according to Woodard.
Humphries said she had been hopeful to hear the bill during a special session in the fall, which did not occur. 
“When that didn’t happen, we said, well, we just need to get it done as soon as possible,” she said. “The first week, I have a lot going on in Judiciary. I don’t have any bills ready to be heard this week, but this was ready.”
Carmichael disagreed with that explanation. 
“This is happening so quickly because it’s a railroad job,” he said. “The committee chair wants to move her bill as fast as possible. She introduced it on the first day of the session yesterday; we heard the bill today. We heard the bill without the benefit of the written testimony of hundreds of Kansans who took the trouble to write to the committee to express their opinions.”
Humphries said the bill would not be voted on Wednesday so that committee members would have time to read all of the testimony submitted. While Carmichael said he appreciated the time to read submissions, he thinks the legislation will “pass the House within the next week.”
Carmichael also challenged the testimony Kobach gave before the committee about the Kansas Court of Appeals decision regarding changing gender markers on driver’s licenses. 
The Court of Appeals determined Kobach showed no irreparable harm to the state if gender markers were changed.
“That was one of the most astonishing parts of the Court of Appeals opinion, because we did present evidence of irreparable harm,” the attorney general told the committee. “We presented evidence from law enforcement officers both from Shawnee County and Johnson County, indicating actual examples of where people who had an arrest warrant out for them had attempted to either change the sex or appear to change the sex, or taken steps to so the arrest warrant is out for a male to hold themselves out as female.”
Carmichael said after the hearing that the attorney general “terribly mischaracterized the Court of Appeals decision.” 
“If you read the opinion, you will find that there are five to 10 pages in the 56-page opinion describing each witness’s testimony and explaining why the Attorney General’s witnesses did not meet the burden of proof because, in the end, those witnesses actually ended up supporting the state’s position,” he said.
Carmichael and Rep. Lindsay Vaughn, D-Overland Park, were the most critical of the attorney general’s testimony. 
Carmichael said it’s likely “this very bad bill” will pass.
“That does not mean that this bill will survive appellate scrutiny,” he said. “I could sit here and write a fine legal brief showing multiple problems with this, not only constitutional problems, but just simple, basic lawyerly drafting problems as well. This has been rushed.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Loud-Light-120260113_1651040-1024x684.jpg,,,2026-01-14 13:59:50.168611

“This is a prostate screening bill that we had handled last year that went downstairs to the House and got tied up at the end of the session and was unable to get out,” Livingston said during the committee meeting.

The 2025 version of the bill was approved by the Senate and committees in both chambers by the end of April. It was never considered by the full House. 
The American Cancer Society estimates that 5,440 men in Alabama will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year. It also estimates that 10% of those will die from the disease. 
Jane Adams, government relations director for ACS Cancer Action Now in Alabama, said in an interview Wednesday that early screenings for prostate cancer, as well as colon and breast cancer, can significantly improve outcomes.
“It’s a movement that’s happening across the country to eliminate these cost sharing barriers,” Adams said. “If you detect your prostate cancer early, it’s very treatable, but a late detection, or late stage of that cancer is terminal.”
According to the American Cancer Society, Black men are at higher risk for the disease. The mortality rate for prostate cancer was 18.7 per 100,000 men in 2022, half of what it was in 1993. The 5-year survival rate for the disease is 100% for the majority of men diagnosed with localized- or regional-stage prostate cancer, but drops to 37% for those diagnosed with distant-stage disease, according to the American Cancer Society. The 10-year survival rate for all stages combined is 98%.
The bill only applies the cost-sharing elimination to patients who have a father, brother or son with a prostate diagnosis or cause of death; Black men, and men over fifty. 
“Having to pay a co-payment or deductible is a barrier to getting this screening, which the prostate antigen screening is the most cutting edge screening that there is,” Adams said. “We wanted to eliminate the cost sharing responsibility.”

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)
Significant breakdowns in retirement procedures allowed police and fire officials to collect pension payouts despite records of misconduct that should have barred or reduced those awards, the state comptroller said in a report released Wednesday.
The report found 21 of the roughly 60 Police and Firemen’s Retirement System members with misconduct records examined in the report did not undergo the required honorable service reviews that weigh whether their benefits should be reduced.
“These 21 former officers are the ones we found. We don’t know how many are out there who committed misconduct and are getting full pensions simply because no one told the pension board what they did wrong,” said acting State Comptroller Kevin Walsh.
NJ Assembly starts new term with vows of bipartisan civility

The pension fund’s board has since conducted honorable service reviews for nearly all 21 of those officers, the report says. Four had their pensions partially reduced, though one reduction was later reversed, according to the report.
Under New Jersey law, public pensions are conditioned on honorable service, and the law permits pension boards to reduce or bar pension benefits for public workers who commit misconduct.
Certain offenses like official misconduct, sexual assault, and certain bribery charges, among numerous others, demand that pensions be automatically forfeited, and some of the officials who improperly received benefits faced serious allegations, including an officer charged and later convicted of possessing child pornography.
“These were not insignificant cases of misconduct,” the report says.
Walsh’s office contends that breakdowns occurred at multiple levels. Local employees tasked with sharing information about members’ misconduct with state officials frequently didn’t, the comptroller said, partly because they were often unaware of the breadth of their responsibility.
They wrongly believed information about criminal matters or civil service discipline would automatically flow to the state division that oversees pensions and benefits, or failed to report past discipline out of a belief that resolved matters should not affect a worker’s ability to retire, the report says.
The confidentiality of internal affairs files likewise contributed to the oversights, according to the comptroller. Though state pension officials can obtain those documents, employers have no affirmative duty to provide them absent a request in most circumstances, and local employees responsible for sharing information about misconduct may lack access to them entirely, the report says.
“If the pension board is not affirmatively provided with the information, it will not know to request it in order to evaluate honorable service prior to awarding a pension to a retiring member. In turn, in many instances, the pension board will unknowingly fail to fulfill its statutory and fiduciary duties,” the report says.
In other cases, settlement agreements between officers and their employers improperly shielded misconduct records in violation of state law that requires employers to share agreements that stem from misconduct claims with pension officials.
Some agreements reviewed by the comptroller mischaracterized time officers spent suspended for misconduct as service time that contributed to the size of their pension, according to the report. Others improperly allowed members who were not permitted to work due to misconduct to use vacation or sick time to boost their length of service and secure more lucrative pensions, the report says.
These missteps came with costs, according to the comptroller. Improper pension payments to even a single member can total hundreds of thousands of dollars, weakening the overall health of pension funds.
Though the local part of the Police and Firemen’s Retirement System of New Jersey is better funded than other New Jersey public pensions, the fund is not expected to reach full funding in the next quarter-century, according to state pension documents.
The state’s pension and benefits division and the pension fund should amend regulations to require that employers share misconduct-related documents like plea agreements, investigative reports, and toxicology reports, among dozens of others, the report recommends.
They should require members to self-report any disciplinary matters they faced throughout the length of their enrollment in the pension system and conduct internal audits to identify those who did not undergo an honorable service review, the report says.
The Legislature should consider making those requirements law and allow the attorney general to periodically audit settlement agreements between retired police officers and firefighters and their employers, the comptroller’s report says.

Andy Beshear — has been filed in previous […],"Sen. Chris McDaniel, R-Ryland Heights, speaks on the Senate floor, Feb, 4, 2025. (LRC Public Information)FRANKFORT — A Northern Kentucky Republican senator has again introduced a bill to limit pardon powers of Kentucky governors around election time.
The bill — a response by lawmakers to controversial pardons issued by former Republican Gov. Matt Bevin after losing the 2019 election to Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear — has been filed in previous years by Sen. Chris McDaniel, R-Ryland Heights, but has never gained passage in the House. 
McDaniel has championed the legislation, Senate Bill 10, for now a seventh time since Bevin issued a flurry of pardons to people convicted of crimes including rape, murder and child abuse after losing the election and shortly before leaving office that December.
SB 10 proposes a constitutional amendment that would limit Kentucky governors from issuing pardons and sentence commutations 60 days before their election through the inauguration in December. If the General Assembly passes the bill this year, Kentucky voters will have to decide to enact the legislation. 
Speaking to reporters after a Wednesday meeting of the Senate State and Local Government Committee, McDaniel said he is “fairly optimistic that it’s got a good shot this year.” He said those on both political sides of the aisle see pardons issued at the state and federal level in recent years “ultimately end up at the same place, which is an unchecked pardon power is simply not a good thing.”

In recent national memory, both Republican President Donald Trump and former Democratic President Joe Biden have been criticized for pardons they’ve issued, such as Trump’s for people convicted of crimes stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, and Biden’s pardons for his family members and those on the congressional committee to investigate the Jan. 6 attack. 
McDaniel pointed to one of Bevin’s pardons while presenting the bill to the committee. Though it was not formally filed with the secretary of state’s office, Bevin had written a pardon for Robert Markham Taylor, who was sentenced to prison in 2016 for murdering and kidnapping Alex Johnson. 
McDaniel said Taylor “found himself in prison because of a system that is designed to guarantee to the maximum extent humanly possible, the appropriate administration of justice” — the courts. 
“It is the system in our nation and in our Commonwealth that must be relied upon for the effective administration of justice,” McDaniel said. “ The system of unaccountable pardons short circuits the system of justice upon which our citizens rely every day.”
Sen. Keturah Herron, D-Louisville, said during the meeting that she’s previously voted in favor of the legislation in the past, but still has “concerns about the potential chilling effect that it will have on individuals and their abilities to be pardoned.” The committee later unanimously voted in favor of McDaniel’s bill. 
After the meeting, McDaniel said that the campaign for approving the amendment would likely require a lot of “grassroots campaigning” on his part. He noted that the bill does not have a fiscal requirement, nor does it address a social issue. 
“This is just a straight-up weakness in the Constitution, and I think … I’ll have a lot of miles on my car in the fall trying to drum up support,” he said.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Every speaker at a public Michigan Supreme Court hearing on Wednesday — including lawyers and representatives from advocacy groups from around Michigan — spoke in favor of a proposed rule that would bar civil arrests, including immigration arrests, at Michigan courthouses. 
The rule, which was first proposed in November and garnered over 2,500 online comments during the public comment period, would prohibit any civil arrests from taking place in a courthouse “while attending a court proceeding or having legal business in the courthouse” — a policy that would cover most ICE arrests, which are often done under administrative warrants, not judicial warrants. 
Most speakers at Wednesday’s hearing emphasized the importance of the proposed rule to allow the judicial process to play out as it is intended, making it so victims, witnesses and litigants feel safe to come into court. 
“Immigration enforcement activity in courthouses undermines racial justice when staff and court visitors may be stopped or questioned based on race, accent or perceived immigration status, while their white counterparts pass freely,” said Elinor Jordan, an attorney at the Michigan Poverty Law Project. “It’s traumatic, intimidating and destabilizing.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The focus of the hearing, though not explicitly mentioned in the text of the proposed rule, was on ICE arrests — so much so that Lisa Varnier, an attorney in Oakland County, urged the justices to add a definition of civil arrests that explicitly includes immigration arrests. 
“From my work with immigrants, I can tell you that even though they are fully documented and are in this country with the permission of the federal government, they are absolutely terrified of going to any court building for fear that they will be arrested by ICE,” Varnier said. “Their fear precludes them from participating in criminal and justice, civil justice systems.”
“They are destroying the community’s trust in law enforcement,” continued Emily Duthinh, another Oakland County attorney. “This undermines law and order and makes all of us less safe.”
If this rule is approved by the state’s Supreme Court, it would place Michigan alongside states like New York, Connecticut and Illinois that have similar policies in place. 
“Other courts have implemented such rules, and they have been found not to be preempted by federal law,” said Syeda Davidson, a staff attorney for the ACLU of Michigan. “Absent a clear and manifest purpose expressed by Congress, there is a presumption against federal law preempting state law.”
Eli Savit, the Washtenaw County Prosecuting Attorney and a candidate for state Attorney General, was the sole elected official to speak during the hearing, highlighting how the fear of immigration has made it harder to prosecute cases.
“Since last year, we have seen a troubling increase in victims who are non-citizens failing to show up to court to testify against their abusers. I’ve talked to colleagues across the state and indeed, across the nation, and this is a trend that they are all experiencing,” Savit said. “I just want to highlight exactly what that means. What that means is that victims of crime are frequently more afraid of the judicial system, more afraid of their own government, than they are of the person who harmed them.”
The Michigan Supreme Court’s seven justices will make the final decision on whether or not to adopt the rule and any changes to be made. The sole Republican on the court, Justice Brian Zahra, had stated on the initial proposal that he would have declined to publish the proposal for comment.

,DC,2026-01-14 17:43:42+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Judge weighs Trump administration limits on congressional visits to immigration facilities,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judge-weighs-trump-administration-limits-congressional-visits-immigration-facilities,,"WASHINGTON —  U.S. District Court Judge Jia Cobb Wednesday probed whether the Trump administration has violated her court order, after Minnesota lawmakers said they were denied an oversight visit to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility following a deadly shooting by an immigration officer in Minneapolis. Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar, Angie Craig and Kelly Morrison of Minnesota said they were denied entry to the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis last weekend. An attorney representing the lawmakers, Christine L. Coogle, asked Cobb to make it clear to the Trump administration that her stay order is in place. Last month, Cobb issued a temporary block on a policy by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that required seven days notice for lawmakers to conduct oversight visits at ICE facilities.Cobb found Noem violated a 2019 appropriations law, referred to as Section 527, that allows for unannounced oversight visits at facilities that hold immigrants. “If the government is using 527 funds to exclude members of Congress from (ICE) facilities, that does run afoul of my order,” Cobb said during Wednesday’s hearing.Dems eye DHS funding As the Trump administration has carried out an aggressive immigration campaign, and with Democrats the minority party in both chambers of Congress, unannounced oversight visits to ICE facilities are one of the few tools Democrats can use. The other way they could try to counter the enforcement push is through appropriations to the Department of Homeland Security.For example, the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which is made up of nearly 100 Democrats, vowed on Tuesday to vote against any DHS appropriations bill unless major changes are made at ICE regarding immigration enforcement.Separately, Democrats on Wednesday introduced articles of impeachment against Noem. One count is connected to the denial of oversight visits. New Noem policy after Renee Good killingOne day after federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross killed 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis, Noem issued a new memo for members of Congress who want to conduct oversight visits at ICE facilities. She required a seven-day notice, nearly identical to the policy that initially prompted the suit from Democrats last year.Noem argued in her new policy that because those federal ICE facilities are using funds through the spending and tax cuts package, and not the DHS appropriations bill, they are therefore exempt from unannounced oversight visits by members of Congress. In an emergency request, Democrats argued the funds DHS is using apply under Section 527, and DHS is violating Cobb's stay.Cobb said on Wednesday she could not make a determination if her order was violated until she can get a clear answer from the Trump administration as to the source of the funds. She directed Department of Justice lawyers to determine what it is.Funding stream questionIn court filings, DOJ argued the facilities are funded through the “One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act” passed and signed into law last year, and that DHS does not need to comply with Section 527.The OBBBA, passed through a congressional process called reconciliation, is allowed to adjust federal spending even though it is not an appropriations law.Coogle said until OBBAA, the only funding for ICE came from appropriations, and argued the two funding streams can’t be separated. She said the Trump administration is trying to “make a game here” with appropriations law.“Appropriations are not a game. They are the law,” Coogle said.  The House Democrats who sued include Joe Neguse of Colorado, Adriano Espaillat of New York, Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Robert Garcia of California, J. Luis Correa of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Veronica Escobar of Texas, Dan Goldman of New York, Jimmy Gomez of California, Raul Ruiz of California, Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and Norma Torres of California.",,,,2026-01-14 12:58:32.206113

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Eligibility in a fledgling state swimming lesson voucher program could be revamped to accommodate more older children and fewer babies under a bill moving its way through the state Legislature.
The House Health Care Budget Committee voted unanimously Wednesday to pass HB 85 along to its next committee. Filed by St. Augustine Rep. Kim Kendall, the bill ups the age eligibility from four years to seven years while eliminating the opportunity for swimming lessons for babies under age 1 who she said are most apt to drown in a bathtub at home.
“So, ages zero to one, the babies show reflexes that looks like swimming but they’re too young to actually lift their head up enough to be able to breathe out of water and the majority of infant death from drowning at the age of 1 happen in bathtubs at home,” she said adding that the babies who take the lessons have “to come back later, at an older age, to repeat the course.”
Department of Children and Family data show that in 2025 a total 112 children died in Florida from drowning. Seventy-three of the children were between the ages of 1 and 3. Three were babies under the age of 1.
In 2024, 106 children drowned, of which 65 were between the ages of 1 and 3 and two were babies under age 1.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In Florida, drowning is the leading cause of unintentional death in children ages 1 to 4, according to the Department of Health website advertising the swim voucher program.
Florida ranked highest in the nation between 2019 and 2021 for unintentional drowning deaths among children ages 1 to 4 and birth to 9, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control data.
To help abate the problem, the Legislature two years ago earmarked $500,000 and directed the DOH to create a voucher program for children living in families at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, which is $64,300 for a family of four.
The DOH received 16,663 applications during the program’s first year of operations and awarded 4,945 vouchers, a legislative staff analysis shows.
Of the near 5,000 vouchers awarded that year, the analysis shows:

646 were given to babies under the age of 1;
1,036 were given to 1-year-olds;
1,160 were awarded to 2-year-olds;
1,107 were awarded to 3-year-olds; 
952 were awarded to 4-year-olds; 
44 were awarded to children 5 and older.

The Legislature in 2025 agreed to double the funding in the program to $1 million and to require that children with autism and in active-duty military families be given first priority. The staff analysis did not include a break-out of awards by age cohort for that year.
There’s no detailed information in the staff analysis about the number of children with autism who received the swim vouchers in 2025 or who have drowned.
But Kendall said that up to one-third of the children between the ages of 4 and 12 who drown have autism and that 58% of the children between the ages of 5 and 12 who drown have autism.
The bill doesn’t contain any additional funding but Kendall said she’s been told some of the contracted swim lesson vendors have tried to stretch the money available to accommodate more children by teaching group swim lessons.
Kendall told committee members she’s proposing the changes in age eligibility in an effort “to take a great program and simply make it more efficient.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_7480-scaled-e1761917850805-1024x558.jpeg,,,2026-01-14 12:58:32.206113

Marty Jackley’s official opinion came in response to a question on the issue from Democratic Senate Minority Leader Liz Larson of Sioux Falls.
State law doesn’t “forbid or permit” the use of campaign funds for security or child care, Jackley’s opinion says, but there are broad outlines on what constitutes acceptable uses.
Campaign money can be spent on things directly related to a campaign, “incident to being a public official” or former public official, or donated to other campaigns or campaign committees, the opinion says.

State laws offer “broad descriptions” on what constitutes campaign activity, which Jackley says was intentional and meant to avoid excluding some activities those laws’ authors may not have considered.
The Federal Election Commission, he notes in the opinion, “explicitly permits candidates for federal office to use campaign contributions for childcare expenses incurred during the candidate’s political campaign.”
“As of the date of this letter, fifteen states have enacted similar laws,” the opinion says.
“These states, including our neighbors Minnesota and Montana, permit a candidate to use campaign funds to pay reasonable and necessary childcare or dependent care expenses incurred because of the campaign.”
A smaller number of states, he wrote, now recognize security spending as an acceptable use of funds.
Jackley concluded that such expenses may be permissible “so long as there is a clear nexus to the campaign or office and are not for personal benefit.”
“The Legislature has the power to create and revise statutes and has the duty to clarify the relevant statutes if desired,” Jackley wrote.
Senator: Clarity request born of safety concerns
Security was the primary reason for the request, Larson said. Concerns over the safety of candidates have grown since the killing last year of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Larson said. The man who killed the Hortmans shot and wounded Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife the same day.
“This is a dangerous role that we’re playing at certain times,” Larson said. “So we want a clarification on that.”
Security spending wouldn’t necessarily take the form of paid security guards, Larson said, although it could. Campaign funds could be used to pay for more basic security features like deadbolts at campaign offices or surveillance cameras.
“We’re not governor-level,” Larson said of state lawmakers. “We don’t need a full entourage. But sometimes there are things that you want to have taken care of.”
Wrapping child care into the request for clarification made sense, Larson said, as that’s become a more common question around the country for parents who aim for political office.
Former Democratic Sen. Reynold Nesiba of Sioux Falls brought a bill to legalize the use of campaign dollars for child care in 2024, with Larson as a co-sponsor. The Senate State Affairs Committee rejected that bill 8-1.

HB 429 by Republican Rep. Jessica Baker adds new methods of identifying gang members to Florida statute. It does not criminalize simply being a member of a gang, but instead allows these individuals to be punished more severely if they’ve been convicted of a crime and have either posted about, mentioned, or been identified in gang activity.
This could include posting about gang activity on social media, being observed in the company of a gang member at least twice, being identified as a gang member by a parent, guardian, or spouse, or using “gang-related language.”

This is defined as any verbal, written, or digital statement that signals gang affiliation, supports gang activity, or uses recognized gang codes, symbols, or terminology.
If at least two of the above are determined, the sentence enhancement would apply — meaning the sentence would be one degree more serious than written in statute (a second-degree misdemeanor would be a first-degree misdemeanor, and so on).
“This bill is not criminalizing gang affiliation. … It’s used for enhancement purposes only,” Baker said in Wednesday’s Criminal Justice Subcommittee hearing.
“The purpose of this bill is modernizing the statute,” the Jacksonville Republican continued. “Law enforcement is having a hard time proving criminal gang membership because gang members know where the line is, and social media and online platforms have not been part of the statute ever before.”
On Monday, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced that the “Sex, Money, Murder” gang’s kingpin, Hernando Thompson, was convicted in Polk County last week on five charges including racketeering, conspiracy to commit racketeering, and three counts of directing criminal gang activities.
Thompson had 14 previous felonies, 10 previous misdemeanors, and two stints in state prison in 2011-2013 and 2014-2015. He’d previously been arrested for aggravated assault, possession and sale of cocaine, domestic violence battery, and carrying a prohibited weapon.
“If you are a gang member, a sex predator, drug trafficker, and you happen to be listening to this press conference: Unless you want to spend the rest of your life in a cage, I strongly encourage you to listen to the attorney general and the sheriff and relocate your operations from Florida,” statewide prosecutor Brad McVay said.

(File photo courtesy of Clemson University)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s inspector general will examine the relationship between Clemson University and a proposal for a massive new subdivision in Oconee County following potential conflict of interest concerns.
Clemson became entangled in the controversy surrounding the 600-acre development as President Jim Clements and former Gov. Nikki Haley, a Clemson board member, also sat on the board of the publicly traded homebuilding company believed to be behind the proposed neighborhood.
College presidents on corporate boards can draw schools into controversy. It happened at Clemson.

Senate President Thomas Alexander, who represents Oconee County, requested the investigation “to ensure accountability and uphold public confidence,” according to a statement Wednesday.
House Speaker Murrell Smith also backed the request.
“Public confidence in our institutions depends not only on whether the law is followed, but on whether actions are viewed as beyond reproach,” the Sumter Republican said in a statement.
Clemson officials, in a statement, said the college will cooperate fully with the inspector general and expressed confidence the review will confirm the school acted appropriately.
Developers of the project approached Oconee County leaders about their proposal last year.
Though developers never submitted an official application with the county, an early marketing plan called for 5,200 housing units — a number that was later reduced to 3,200 units. It also included a satellite Clemson campus on the property, located about 5 miles northeast of the school, near Newry Mill.
The developers also were in contact with the college’s senior management team in 2023 and 2024, even flying Clemson staff on a company plane to tour a similar development near Purdue University in Indiana.
Messages from the developers came from an email addresses associated with United Homes Group, formerly Great Southern Homes, the publicly-traded company where Clements had been on the board since 2022.
Both the college and the company denied that the homebuilder benefited from the connection to the university or used it to put pressure on the county to approve development plans.
“At no point has the University provided funding for, partnered on or endorsed the planning or construction of any residential development related to this proposal,” the college wrote in a statement to the SC Daily Gazette and other outlets.
“As is standard practice, an administrative team conducted a preliminary review to assess the multi-use concept’s potential economic and community impact,” the statement continued. “After completing its due diligence, the University decided not to pursue the economic development initiative.”
Clemson staff last met with the developers in November 2024.
Clemson, in a December letter to Oconee County Council, also stated United Homes was not the developer. Instead, the developer was a different, separate company operated by Michael Neiri, the chairman of United Homes and a Clemson alumnus.
Legislators said the request to have the inspector general look into the issue is not an allegation of wrongdoing, but rather “a proactive and responsible step to ensure transparency.”
“The people of Oconee County deserve clarity and confidence in the decisions that affect their community,” state Rep. Adam Duncan said in a statement.
“An independent review ensures that questions are answered thoroughly and objectively, and public trust is maintained,” said the Republican who represents the district impacted by the Newry development.

The committee met Tuesday for a handful of hearings, including one for Senate Bill 483, which would appropriate $15 million in state general funds over two years to help child care employers with employee recruitment and retention. 
The bill aims to resolve a funding issue that arose from the state’s biennial budget signed in June. Legislators sought to fund the $15 million using extra federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families money, knowing the appropriation was “contingent” on approval from the federal government. TANF is a federal program that helps low-income families achieve economic stability by giving states grants to operate programs that fall under one of its specific statutory purposes. 
SB 483 proposes that if the federal government denies the use of TANF funds for child care workforce recruitment and retention, or does not respond to state officials by July 1, 2026, state general funds would be used for the initiative. 
In October, the Administration for Children and Families sent the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services a contradictory response regarding the allowable use of funds. 
First, state officials were told that once TANF funding was transferred to the Child Care Development Fund, the main fund New Hampshire uses for child care purposes, “CCDF funds can be used for child care worker bonuses and other retention activities.” 
Later in the email, the Administration for Children and Families wrote, “it is not clear to the Office of Family Assistance how recruitment and retention bonuses for New Hampshire child care employers meet a TANF purpose — especially in the absence of information about other TANF expenditures related to child care.”
While the language of the email is murky, state Health and Human Services officials told the Bulletin in November that the federal government said using TANF money for child care workforce retention and recruitment was “not an allowable use” under federal regulations, and the development fund dollars were already budgeted for the New Hampshire Child Care Scholarship Program. 
“Funding child care recruitment and retention initiatives does not fall into one of the four purposes of the TANF program specified in federal law,” Jake Leon, communications director for Health and Human Services, said. 
Karen Hebert, director of the Division of Economic Stability, testified to the same multiple times during Tuesday’s hearing and the executive session that followed.
“What this bill does is it adds $7.5 million per fiscal year, with the intent of it being TANF funding to use for the child care workforce,” Hebert said. “It is the department’s interpretation, based on the response from the Administration for Children and Families, that [for] the TANF grant [to] directly pay for the child care workforce is not an allowable use of TANF funds.” 
However, members of the committee expressed confusion not only about the situation with TANF funding, but also about how federal funding for New Hampshire child care works in general. Sen. David Watters, a Dover Democrat, apologized for being “hopelessly confused” about how money could or could not be used.
Sen. Timothy Lang, a Sanbornton Republican, requested the department “aggressively pursue” a clear yes or no from the federal government before discussing the use of state dollars. 
“This is an issue that’s extremely important for working-class families,” he said. “Hopefully we’ll get some sort of answer back by being aggressive and letting them know this is an important issue for the state of New Hampshire.”
Sen. James Gray, a Rochester Republican and chairman of the Finance Committee, said he would not call for a vote on the bill because “some of these discussions would probably be better offline.” 
The appropriation was passed in 2023 using state general funds, but due to a series of state spending reductions, legislators attempted to use federal funds for the 2025-2027 budget. 
Despite the committee making no recommendation on the bill, providers and advocates said they are “hopeful” about the outcome because legislators have shown an interest in finding a solution and in funding recruitment and retention efforts. 
At least 20 child care providers and advocates gathered at the State House before the hearing to show support for the bill. When it came time for public testimony, the room filled to capacity as child care teachers, program directors, and advocates lined up to speak in support of the bill.

According to the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute, the median hourly wage for a New Hampshire child care worker in 2023 was $15.62, while the median wage of a retail salesperson was $16.71, and the median wage for all New Hampshire occupations was $24.03. Granite State families are also spending more than three times as much on child care than the federal government recommends due to high child care costs statewide. Both could be addressed if SB 483 passes. 
Child care providers also testified about some of the ways they used the last state appropriation: increasing staff wages, maintaining classroom capacity, providing staff benefits such as health care and retirement, and stabilizing tuition costs. 
While the Senate bill is on hold, a hearing for the House counterpart, House Bill 1566, has not yet been scheduled.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/childcarebill-1024x598.jpg,,,2026-01-14 11:59:16.358605

Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, marks demise of his hometown newspaper, the Plainville Times, and honors the importance of community journalism.","U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, offers a tribute in the U.S. Senate to his hometown newspaper, the Plainville Times, after it folds into a new entity, the Stockton Sentinel-Times. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from U.S. Senate's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas, an occupational resident of Washington, D.C., for three decades, says he looked forward to reading weekly editions of the Plainville Times for the latest news from his hometown.
“Growing up in this small town in western Kansas, I saw firsthand how the newspaper supported the community and brought neighbors, friends and even strangers together,” Moran said.
In a speech on the U.S. Senate floor, the Republican explained that the community of Plainville, a city of 1,700 people in Rooks County, could no longer financially sustain the Times. In the end, owners of the Stockton Sentinel offered a lifeline. Going forward, news from Stockton and Plainville will be captured in pages of the newly christened Stockton Sentinel-Times.
“Local journalism is important to the future of rural America,” Moran said. “Community journalism pulls us together. National journalism has the habit of tearing us apart.”
The senator said he was grateful to dedicated editors, reporters and staff whose contributions made his hometown paper informative and beloved.
Moran said the Times’ editor, Candace Rachel, was a steady presence in Plainville with a reporters’ notebook in hand and a camera slung over her shoulder. The senator said he was grateful the Sentinel’s owners, Bart Hamilton and Susan Hamilton Schneider, would maintain coverage of his hometown and Rooks County with the Sentinel-Times.
“I take sadness in the demise, the departure of my hometown paper. I take pleasure and pride in its continuation with news being covered by the Sentinel-Times,” he said.
The merger of the Times and Sentinel represents a trend in the Kansas newspaper industry. In 2025, the state had about 150 newspapers. In the past 20 years, approximately 50 newspapers closed or were merged with other publications. Most newspapers in Kansas publish weekly.
Moran said managing a newspaper in Kansas, and elsewhere in the United States, was a demanding quest.
“Today, community journalism faces growing challenges with a rapidly changing media environment as well as workforce struggles and financial strains,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Moran-Plainville-Times-newspaper.png,,,2026-01-14 11:59:16.358605

On January 13, 2026, at approximately 7:00 p.m. troopers responded to Dollar General, located at 1549 Savannah Road in Lewes, for a report of a robbery. When troopers arrived, they learned that a white female suspect, wearing white sweatpants, a dark colored sweatshirt, and a mask, approached two employees, implied she had a gun, and demanded money. The suspect accessed the register, stole money, and fled in a blue Ford Focus with a Delaware tag.
At approximately 8:00 p.m., troopers responded to the 14000 block of Staytonville Road in Lincoln for a report of a disabled blue Ford Focus in the roadway. When troopers arrived, they spoke to the driver, who matched the description of the robbery suspect and identified her as Shelly Sortino. A computer check showed that Sortino had an active capias warrant, and the license plate on the Focus was stolen. Through investigative means, troopers identified Sortino as the suspect in the robbery, and she was arrested without incident.
Sortino was taken to Troop 7, where she was charged with the crimes listed below, arraigned by Justice of the Peace Court 11, and committed to Sussex Correctional Institution on a $33,000 secured bond.

“All subsidy funds requested” were released, and providers can expect to receive delayed payments by Jan. 16, an email from the state office said.
The delay left child care providers uncertain of when they would be reimbursed for services rendered in December through a nationwide subsidy program designed to increase access to child care for low-income and foster families.
The state office, part of Missouri’s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, said in a press release last week that it had responded to a federal request for a detailed explanation of the expenses to be reimbursed through the subsidy program. 
Prior to Tuesday’s announcement, advocates and child care providers scrambled for answers as invoices sat unpaid. 
Lisa Scheer, director of Baden Christian Child Care in St. Louis, told The Independent Friday that while the federal funds were at that point only a few days late, delays left providers putting off bill payments and questioning how long they would be able to keep their doors open.
Casey Hanson, deputy director of Kids Win Missouri, said many providers have already received payment. Scheer told The Independent that she is still waiting. 
U.S. Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary Jim O’Neill said in a Dec. 30 social media post that the federal Administration for Children and Families would begin requiring states to justify their child care expenses before receiving funding. 
The state’s education department on Thursday evening received word from federal officials that it would need to meet requirements of the federal “Defend the Spend” initiative, first introduced by the now-dissolved Department of Government Efficiency, the department’s spokesperson told The Independent. 
More than 90% of the $286 million approved for Missouri’s child care subsidy program by state lawmakers and Gov.

At the women’s unit at the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility, Lisa Jo Chamberlin’s clean prison record hasn’t earned her similar privileges. 
She lives in total isolation and, since Dec. 30, more restrictions. Chamberlin is the only woman on Mississippi’s death row, where she’s been the past decade. 
“This is the worst treatment I have seen by far,” said the Rev. Jeff Hood, who communicates with death row prisoners around the country and has witnessed nearly a dozen executions. 
More restrictive conditions have nearly been deadly. Chamberlin was on suicide watch at least twice in 2025 as her mental health declined. At one point, she said she considered whether to sign papers to let her execution proceed, but then ultimately decided not to.
Chamberlin said she enjoys peace, quiet and time to herself and has turned to activities like writing, reading the Bible, sharing her story and passing the time as she continues to appeal her case and await a possible execution. 
She said doesn’t mind being on her own, but Chamberlin doesn’t want to be isolated. 
“I have to do everything by myself because I’m the only woman on death row,” Chamberlin said in a phone interview with Mississippi Today. 
She has spent all  of her prison sentence at the women’s prison in Pearl. 
Last May, Chamberlin saw a change in her custody level and was able to gain some privileges, including a tablet to make calls and send messages. Chamberlin said those greatly improved her quality of life. She said the tablet was a gamechanger. 
At the end of the year, she noticed more restrictions to her time out of her cell and access to areas where she previously was able to go. She said she has been confined to her cell for 48-hour periods before being let out to shower and use the community microwave. 
She is no longer able to walk laps around the unit and access video calls because with her new housing and custody status, Chamberlin can’t go to certain areas. 
Prison records list her location as Unit 720 Max, which is closed custody that requires close supervision and security control. Those in close custody anywhere in the prison system are confined to a cell or dormitory unit with similar level custody prisoners, according to MDOC’s inmate handbook. 
Chamberlin said the women’s prison superintendent told her the reason for the change in privileges and restrictions: You are on death row, so you will be treated like the men on death row. 
Kate Head, a spokesperson for the Mississippi Department of Corrections, did not respond to a request for comment. 
Chamberlin was convicted and sentenced to death for the 2004 murder of two people in Hattiesburg. 
She and co-defendant and former partner Roger Gillett were arrested in Kansas on a tip that they stole a car and were manufacturing drugs at his family’s farm. As authorities searched the farm, they found a freezer taped shut containing the dismembered bodies of the victims: Vernon Hulett, who was Gillett’s cousin, and Linda Heintzelman, who was Hulett’s girlfriend. Chamblerlin and Gillett had lived with the victims in Hattiesburg. 
Separately, Chamberlin and Gillett were convicted and sentenced to death in 2006. Years later, the Mississippi Supreme Court vacated his death sentence because due process rights were violated when the jury considered an invalid aggravating factor. He was resentenced in 2018 to life without parole. 
Chamberlin has pursued her own appeals, including a third petition for post-conviction relief in August, which the state opposes and has asked to be dismissed. As of January, the case has been submitted without argument. 
Death row inmates of any gender are housed in a facility or unit deemed appropriate by the MDOC commissioner, and the status requires the highest level of supervision available, according to the MDOC inmate handbook. 
Advocates helped get Chamberlin into a less restrictive situation, only to have it taken away, Hood said. 
He and other advocates said they want similar privileges and housing situations for Chamberlin as the death row men have, but that is not happening. Instead, they see unfairness in Chamberlin’s imprisonment compared to the experience of the men on death row in Mississippi and women on death row in other states. 
For years, death row prisoners at Parchman have been housed in Unit 29, but last year they were moved to Unit 17, which is fenced in and recently remodeled, said prison reform advocate Mitzi Magleby.  
The unit is also where the gas chamber, electric chair and the gurney used for lethal injection are located. 
An MDOC spokesperson did not respond to questions about how men are housed on death row and why they were moved. Prison records for each man on death row list their location as Unit 17. 
Nationwide, as of October, 47 women were on death row, with the majority in California, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Mississippi is among seven states with just one woman with a death sentence, and it’s not the only state with apparent disparate treatment of women facing execution.
Antoinette Frank, the only woman on Louisiana’s death row, has been held in conditions resembling solitary confinement since her 1995 triple homicide conviction, The Guardian reported. She is separated from the general prison population, has experienced extended lockdowns and doesn’t have access to in-person classes. 
She was part of a group of death row prisoners who sought clemency in 2023. The Louisiana state Board of Pardons denied all of them. 
After a 15-year hiatus, Louisiana has resumed executions. The state’s attorney general has filed requests to set execution dates for five on death row, including Frank. 
Hood, the death row spiritual adviser, is also in contact with Tennessee’s Christa Pike who spent years in restrictive housing until 2024. Since her 1996 murder conviction, Pike was essentially in solitary confinement before she sued the prison system in 2022. 
As part of the lawsuit settlement, she has been allowed to work, have more interaction with women in general population and have the ability to earn opportunities that the death row men already have access to, according to the Death Penalty Information Center and local reporting. 
The Tennessee Supreme Court has scheduled her execution for Sept. 30, which would make her the first woman to be executed in the state in more than 200 years. 
Chamberlin said she is exploring legal action around the conditions of her confinement. 
Advocating for herself is something Chamberlin said she has done during her nearly 20 years in prison. She said it’s tiring, but she considers herself a survivor.

Ron DeSantis has selected Adam Tanenbaum, now a judge on Florida’s First District Court of Appeal and former general counsel to the Florida House of Representatives, to serve on the Florida Supreme Court.

DeSantis made the […]","Florida Channel screenshot of Adam Tanenbaum speaking after being selected to serve on the Florida Supreme Court on Jan. 14, 2026.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has selected Adam Tanenbaum, now a judge on Florida’s First District Court of Appeal and former general counsel to the Florida House of Representatives, to serve on the Florida Supreme Court. 
In doing so, DeSantis has now appointed six of the seven justices serving on the high court.
DeSantis made the announcement at Seminole High School in Pinellas County, from which Tanenbaum graduated in 1989. 
Tanenbaum will fill the seat vacated by Justice Charles Canady, who left the court at the of end of last year after 17 years to became director and a professor at the University of Florida Hamilton School for Classical and Civic Education.
In his speech, Tanenbaum referred to himself as an originalist, the judicial philosophy that judges should interpret the Constitution according to its original public meaning that has been embraced by conservatives in recent decades.
“As an originalist, I subscribe to the fixation thesis and the constraint principle,” he said. “The meaning of a text is fixed at the time of its ratification or enactment. And that original meaning does not change over time.”
He went on to say that he shared Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ view “that the judiciary exercises neither force or will, only judgement. That our goal as judges is always to find the correct, original meaning of the law. To instead follow erroneous interpretations of the past, is to essentially make the law, usurping in the process the Legislature’s and the people’s authority.”
DeSantis lauded Tanenbaum’s intellect, referring to how he graduated first in his class at both Seminole High School and at the University of Florida.
Tanenbaum had a background in conservative politics before he got into law. He worked as an intern in 1994 for Newt Gingrich’s GOPAC, a Republican state and local political training organization. He then worked as a summer intern for Florida GOP U.S. Senator Connie Mack in 1995. And he served as public counsel for a couple of months for the Republican Party of Florida in 2001.
He also worked in private practice, as well as serving as a public defender for both the state of Florida and the federal government.
In 2014, he began working for various state agencies. He became the chief deputy solicitor general for the Florida Department of Legal Affairs in 2014-2015.
In 2015 he became general counsel for the Florida Department of State and then general counsel for the Florida House during Speaker Richard Corcoran’s term in 2016-2018. He was appointed by DeSantis to serve on the First District Court of Appeal in Tallahassee on Nov. 1, 2019.
“I was talking to some of my guys after I interviewed the judge,” DeSantis said Wednesday. “It’s like, we’ve got 23-plus million people, you know, in the state of Florida. And I would guarantee you, you will not find 10 people out of that 23 million that knows more about Florida government — not just law, and Supreme Court and courts, but the agencies, the legislative branch, all that — than Judge Tanenbaum. He knows this stuff very, very well.”
While serving on the First District Court of Appeal, heard Byrd v. Black Voters Matter Capacity Bldg. Inst. (2022 and 2025), a high-profile challenge to a redistricting plan that eliminated minority-access voting districts. The state ultimately prevailed.
He was part of a three-judge panel of that court in 2021 that ruled in favor of the DeSantis administration to punish school districts that insisted on strict face-masking policies against COVID-19 in defiance of the governor’s insistence that parents be allowed to opt out for their children.
The appointment of Tanenbaum to the Florida Supreme Court won plaudits from the Florida Justice Reform Institute.
“Judge Adam Tanenbaum is an exceptional choice for the Florida Supreme Court,” said president William Large. “His extensive legal experience, combined with his dedication to public service, demonstrates he is deeply committed to the State of Florida and upholding the rule of law.”
Jorge Labarga is now the lone justice serving on the Florida Supreme Court who was not appointed by DeSantis. He was appointed to the court by then Gov. Charlie Crist in 2009. He is 73 years old, meaning that he must retire due to age term-limits before the 2028 election.

Ohioans for Cannabis Choice filed a petition for a referendum to repeal Ohio Senate Bill 56, which is set to take effect March 20 after Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed the bill into law on Dec. 19. The referendum was filed with Yost’s office on Dec. 29.

“Upon review of the summary, we identified omissions and misstatements that, as a whole, would mislead a potential signer as to the scope and effect of S.B. 56,” Yost wrote in a response letter to the petitioners. 
If Yost had certified the language, Ohioans for Cannabis Choice would have been able to start to collect signatures to get a referendum on the November ballot.
“We are going to fix the language, collect an additional 1,000 signatures, and not slow down,” Dennis Willard, spokesperson for Ohioans for Cannabis Choice, said in a statement. 
“Voters this November will have the opportunity to say no to S.B. 56, no to government overreach, no to closing 6,000 businesses and abandoning thousands of Ohio workers, and no to defying the will of Ohioans who overwhelmingly supported legalizing cannabis in 2023.” 
Ohioans voted to legalize marijuana in 2023, recreational sales started in August 2024, and sales totaled more than $836 million in 2025.
“Republicans know Ohioans are ready to hold them accountable for rewriting Issue 2, so instead of letting voters decide, they delay and distract to try and prevent the referendum altogether,” Ohio House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati, said in a statement. 
The new law will reduce the THC levels in adult-use marijuana extracts from a maximum of 90% down to a maximum of 70%, cap THC levels in adult-use flower to 35%, and prohibit smoking in most public places. It prohibits possessing marijuana in anything outside of its original packaging and criminalizes bringing legal marijuana from another state back to Ohio. S.B. 56 also requires drivers to store marijuana in the trunk of their car while driving. 
If Ohioans for Cannabis Choice are able to get the language certified, they’ll need to collect 6% of the total number of votes cast in the most recent gubernatorial election (248,092) to get on the Nov. 3 ballot. The group will also need 3% of an individual county’s gubernatorial turnout in 44 of Ohio’s 88 counties.
Organizers will have 90 days from the date the governor filed the law with the secretary to collect the required signatures.
The last referendum that passed in Ohio was when voters overturned an anti-collective bargaining law in 2011.

“It’s probably one of the least restrictive hands-free bills in the country, but it’s a step in the right direction,” Senate Transportation Committee Chair Jimmy Higdon told his colleagues. “It adds Kentucky to the list of states, approximately 30 states across the country, that do not allow you to have a handheld device in your hand and communicate with it (while driving).”
Higdon, a Lebanon Republican, presented the legislation, Senate Bill 28, to the committee Wednesday morning. Higdon’s final legislative session and the bill is one of his priorities. 
SB 28, or the “the Phone-Down Kentucky Act,” says drivers cannot hold a cell phone while driving to send electronic messages, like texts and emails, or watch moving images, like videos and games. Fines accessed under the legislation will be divided among a traumatic brain injury trust fund, the Kentucky trauma care system fund and a veterans’ program fund.

While presenting his bill, Higdon spoke of meeting Alyssa Burns, whose daughter Camberleigh died in a 2022 crash after a distracted driver hit their car days before her second birthday. Burns previously spoke in support of Higdon’s bill during the legislative interim.
In a statement last week, Burns said “justice for Camberleigh is represented through this bill and through any legislation that ensures no one has the power to take a life without facing consequences.”
“I know this bill won’t bring Camberleigh back, but in a way, it keeps her name and memory alive,” Burns said. “She is not just a statistic on a piece of paper—she was a little girl with her whole life ahead of her.” 
Several committee members expressed support for the legislation. 
Sen. Donald Douglas, R-Nicholasville, who is the vice chairman of the committee and a physician, said that he has “spent a lot of nights in the operating room, helping put people back together who were distracted and who ended up in the operating room” after car accidents. 
“I want you to know I really got tired of seeing our sons and daughters in the emergency room, in the operating room, because of the distractions,” Douglas said. “So I appreciate it for that account.
Sen. Karen Berg, D-Louisville, said that she has been among lawmakers, including Higdon and a few other committee members, who have been practicing getting in the habit of hands-free driving after hearing that the bill would be debated this session. 
“Once you get in the habit of docking your phone when you get in the car, and then you do not touch it again until you get out of the car, it gets easier and easier. It really does,” Berg said while voting in favor of the bill. 
Sen. Greg Elkins, R-Winchester, said that he was supportive of the bill, but in some areas, “I think it doesn’t go far enough.” He added that he would like to see the bill explicitly bar drivers from using cell phones while at a stoplight. 
“I know probably everybody in this room has sat behind someone at a red light or a stoplight, looking at their phone, and everybody goes on in the other lanes, and you’re sitting there, stuck behind that person. I think that’s a safety issue as well,” Elkins said. “I would hope that maybe we could entertain an amendment or address it at some point in the future.” 
Sen. Gex Williams, R-Verona, said while voting in favor of the current bill, he had opposed previous versions because of it barring the use of phones while at a stoplight. He argued that drivers can signal to other stopped cars that the light is green by sounding their car horn. 
“I support it precisely because you can stop and make a call at a green light, unlike last year’s,” Williams said.

(Missouri Office of Administration photo)Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway is asking for nearly $1 million by June to furnish new offices for one of her highest-paid employees.
The request is in the supplemental budget — money needed for programs running short of funds before the end of the fiscal year — for furniture and equipment in 5,000 square feet of a new state office building in Chesterfield.
Both the attorney general’s office and the Office of Administration said the costs are based on standard amounts for building out new space. But lawmakers are raising questions
In interviews with The Independent, both Republican and Democrat legislators said they want to know more about the $989,000 request, which includes $17,000 for space rental and $972,000 for furnishings. Especially in light of warnings from the governor on Tuesday  that Missouri’s surplus of general revenue will run dry in the coming fiscal year. 
“Well, that’s a lot,” Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Republican from Shelbina, said of the nearly $1 million budget request. “I think I’d want to look that plan over.”
Legislative committees in the House and Senate will be briefed on the supplemental appropriation requests in hearings this week.
Missouri revenue surplus nearly gone as Gov. Mike Kehoe unveils his budget plan

The space would be used by Hanaway’s solicitor general, Louis Capozzi, and his staff. Capozzi, and his two chief deputies, are among 22 employees of the attorney general’s office who are paid more than the approximately $126,000 salary paid to Hanaway.
Missouri purchased the 116,000-square-foot office building and an adjacent garage for $16.25 million in January 2025. It is intended to replace the Wainwright State Office Building in downtown St. Louis, which was sold in September 2024.
The solicitor general is the office responsible for handling major cases on appeal and in the trial courts, including recent cases on redistricting and abortion.
Gov. Mike Kehoe, State Auditor Scott Fitzpatrick and State Treasurer Vivek Malek moved their St. Louis operations from the Wainwright building to the Old Post Office, where the attorney general’s office — and the Eastern District Missouri Court of Appeals — already had offices.
The $989,000 request is for $17,000 to pay rent on the space for the final three months of the fiscal year and $982,000 for furnishings.
The cost was estimated by the state Office of Administration and is not extravagant, said Stephanie Whitaker, spokeswoman for Hanaway.
“This is not like they’ve gone from this desk to a nicer desk,” Whitaker said. “This is the first time a desk is being put in at all.”
The desks are standard, modular furniture and the walls that will be installed are intended to match the rest of the building, Whitaker said.
Hanaway “hasn’t even seen what the furniture will look like,” Whitaker said. “(The appropriation) is authority for OA to match the furniture to the rest of their building.”
Office of Administration spokesperson Shayne Martin said the cost will create space for 19 offices, and chairs and conference rooms.
“This is a one time buildout cost and is a complete office build, as a brand new space and is about 150 dollars a square foot,” Martin wrote in an email to The Independent. The cost breaks down to $750,000 to prepare the space and $222,000 to furnish it.
Capozzi has been solicitor general since July, when he was hired away from the Jones Day law firm office in Washington, D.C., where he was an associate attorney. His chief deputies, William Seidleck and Kathleen Hunker, are also recent hires.
Seidleck was hired in August after a brief stint as counsel for the Environmental and Natural Resources Division of the Justice Department. He previously worked as an associate attorney at Latham and Watkins law firm in Washington, D.C.
Hunker was hired in October from the attorney general’s office in Texas.
Hanaway was appointed attorney general in August after her predecessor, Andrew Bailey, was named co-deputy director of the FBI. Payroll reports for her office on the Missouri Accountability Portal show Capozzi, Seidleck and Hunker are all paid more than Hanaway.
The space is needed in part to recruit the top attorneys needed for cases handled by the solicitor general, Whitaker said.
“There is a federal courthouse in St Louis, so quite often a bulk of their team is doing case work in St Louis,” Whitaker said. “It’s also a big recruitment tool to have St Louis as the domicile, and then they travel. So some of his team is Jefferson City, some of his team is St Louis, and then Lou splits his time, so he works out of both.”
The House Budget Committee will be the first to look at the supplemental budget. State Rep. John Voss, a Republican from Cape Girardeau and a member of the committee, said he noticed the request and has questions.
“I’m anxious to hear the attorney general’s request in detail about why investing there is an important part of their strategy and equipping them to do the work that they’ve been authorized to do,” Voss said. “I still need to hear that particular testimony.”

The reporting “speaks volumes about the role that public defenders play in maintaining the integrity of the whole system, not just in defending their clients.”


CalMatters investigative reporter Anat Rubin has won the Sidney Award from the Sidney Hillman Foundation for her story, “The WalMart of public defense: How justice gets sold to the lowest bidder in rural California.” Every month, the Sidney Award honors outstanding investigative journalism that exposes social and economic injustices.
Judges said they were drawn to the investigation because it was “original, well reported, and well-presented.” Sidney judge Lindsay Beyerstein said the reporting “speaks volumes about the role that public defenders play in maintaining the integrity of the whole system, not just in defending their clients.”
Rubin’s investigation found that nearly half of California counties pay private lawyers and firms to represent poor people in criminal cases, and that most of them do it through what’s known as a “flat-fee” contract, meaning they pay a fixed amount, regardless of how many cases the attorneys handle or how much time they spend on each case. As Rubin details in her story, these arrangements so clearly disincentivize investigating and litigating cases that they’ve been banned in other parts of the country. But they have flourished in California. 
She focused the story on one firm with several such contracts throughout the state — a firm that’s become known as the “WalMart of public defense” for its ubiquity and tactics. 
This project is the second part of Rubin’s series examining the lack of key safeguards against wrongful conviction in California. Her first piece, “The Man Who Unsolved a Murder,” found that poor people accused of crimes, who account for at least 80% of criminal defendants, are routinely convicted in California without anyone investigating the charges against them. Close to half of California’s 58 counties do not employ any full-time public defense investigators. Among the remaining counties, defendants’ access to investigators fluctuates wildly, but it’s almost always inadequate.

ARDENTOWN, Del. — The Candlelight Theatre opens its 2026 season this weekend with a clear message to audiences: it’s time to laugh — loudly, often, and without apology.
The season begins with Mel Brooks’ Tony Award-winning musical The Producers, running Jan. 17 through Feb. 23, followed by Young Frankenstein in the spring. Together, the back-to-back Brooks comedies signal a season launch built on fearless humor and crowd-pleasing fun.
The Producers, which won a record 12 Tony Awards, tells the story of a washed-up Broadway producer and his anxious accountant who devise a scheme to make money by staging the worst musical ever written. Their plan famously collapses when the show becomes an unexpected hit, unleashing a string of outrageous moments, sharp satire, and big ensemble numbers.
The comedy is intentionally over the top — poking fun at Broadway, ambition and human ego — and leans into the kind of humor that doesn’t tiptoe around the joke.
“This show is unapologetically funny,” said Bob Kelly, artistic director of the Candlelight Theatre. “It pushes boundaries in a way that reminds people why live theatre is such a joyful experience. We decided to open 2026 with two Mel Brooks comedies because, quite frankly, we should all be laughing more in 2026.”
Kelly said pairing The Producers with Young Frankenstein was a deliberate choice, designed to set an upbeat, audience-friendly tone for the year.
Directed by Jody Anderson, The Producers features choreography by Anderson and Scott Jacobs, with music direction by Betsy Conner.
The cast includes David T. Wills, Mary McAvoy, Andrew Bozzelli, Michelle Lewin Affleck, Bob Gatchel, Benjamin Helbert, Micaela Hickey, Paige Hollenbeck, Nicole Lewin Mariash, Nate Miles-McLean, Jeremy Mitchell, Samantha Ricchiuti, Cory Steiger, Nina Straface, Caleb J. Tracy, Shawn Weaver, Shaun Yates and Anthony Connell.
Opening night for the production is sold out, and many performances are already down to limited availability. Dennis Mahoney, box office manager at Candlelight Theatre, encourages patrons not to assume a performance is completely unavailable if online ticketing shows a sellout.
“Often, a small number of full dinner-and-show tickets are still available through the box office,” Mahoney said. “And most of the time, show-only tickets are available even when dinner seating has sold out.”
As Delaware’s only dinner theatre, Candlelight offers audiences a full evening experience — pairing a freshly prepared meal with a professional production in an intimate, historic venue tucked into Ardentown. Opening weekends are traditionally among the most festive of the year, drawing longtime subscribers alongside first-time guests.
Following The Producers, Candlelight continues its Mel Brooks run with Young Frankenstein, playing March 14 through April 19, before moving into a season that includes Arsenic and Old Lace, Annie, Fiddler on the Roof and the holiday favorite Scrooge.
Tickets and subscription information for The Producers and the full 2026 season are available through the Candlelight Theatre box office and website.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-14-164612.jpg,,,2026-01-14 16:57:14.696244

(Screenshot)A proposal to let Rhode Island voters sign candidates’ nomination papers electronically – increasing access and fending off fraud — inched forward Tuesday with the Rhode Island Board of Election’s backing.
The seven-member panel voted unanimously to support all four pieces of election-related legislation pitched by Rhode Island Secretary of State Gregg Amore, including the first-in-the-nation online nomination paper portal. But Amore will still have to convince the Rhode Island General Assembly and Gov. Dan McKee on his vision.
You can register to vote online. Why not sign candidate nomination papers too?

Amore’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday on the board’s vote.
As Amore explained to the state elections board at a Jan. 6 meeting, voters can already register or update their registration online, and apply for mail ballots, via the Department of State’s online portal. Using that same software to also let voters sign papers for local, state and federal candidates to qualify for the ballot — verifying their identity with the last four digits of a  Social Security number or driver’s license — could eliminate some of the guesswork for local and state election administrators charged with verifying paper-and-pen John Hancocks. 
And it could prevent the criminal forgery that upended the 2023 special election for Rhode Island’s 1st Congressional District, when fake signatures, including those of dead residents, were spotted on the papers for Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos. 
Matos, once a frontrunner in the 11-way primary, finished a distant fourth despite proclaiming her innocence in the signature scandal. Two contractors hired by her campaign to help collect signatures were later charged with multiple criminal felonies for the forgeries. 
The option to sign nomination papers online — pen-and-ink collections would also remain — would also expand access for disabled, overseas and military voters otherwise left out of the early stages of the election process, Amore said. And, it would make it easier for candidates to gain ballot access, guaranteeing at least online that their supporters live in the right district to make the signatures count. 
The Rhode Island Board of Elections offered little discussion in its recommendation vote Tuesday, having already weighed and commended the measure during a prior meeting.
Other election-related pieces of legislation backed by the state elections board Tuesday included easing fines for candidates and campaigns over late filed campaign finance reports; eliminating the state constitutional requirement that voters register at least 30 days before an election (a shorter timeline would be up to the General Assembly to determine); and extending the option for disabled and military voters to submit ballots through a secure, electronic system, extending a 2022 law which expired at the end of 2025. The House Committee on State Government and Elections is scheduled to give initial consideration to the electronic ballot extension bill on Thursday.

Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) offers remarks at a June 6, 2025 town hall in Lansing. | Kyle DavidsonU.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin says she is the subject of a Justice Department investigation connected to a video in which she and several other Democratic lawmakers urged U.S. military and intelligence personnel to refuse “illegal orders.”
The Michigan Democrat from Holly and former CIA officer, confirmed the inquiry in an interview with The New York Times published Tuesday, saying she learned of the investigation from the office of U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, the chief federal prosecutor in the District of Columbia. A spokesman for Pirro’s office declined to confirm or deny to the Times that any investigation was underway.
“I’ve studied this kind of political authoritarianism in other countries my entire professional life,” Slotkin told the Times. “I just can’t believe I am talking about it in my own country.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The announcement marks an escalation in the Trump administration’s response to a 90-second video posted to social media in November in which Slotkin and five other Democratic members of Congress – all with military or intelligence backgrounds – told members of the armed forces and intelligence community that they “can refuse illegal orders” and should “stand up for our laws and our Constitution.”
The lawmakers did not identify specific orders they considered unlawful in the clip. Military justice experts say service members are already required under the Uniform Code of Military Justice to disobey orders they reasonably determine to be unlawful.
The video drew immediate and intense criticism from President Donald Trump. He took to Truth Social to accuse the lawmakers of “seditious behavior” and urged that they be “arrested and put on trial,” later characterizing their actions as “punishable by death.” Trump’s posts also amplified threats from supporters.
In the weeks since the video’s release, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has contacted lawmakers who appeared in the video to schedule interviews, while a separate Pentagon review has focused on Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly.
Kelly, as a retired officer, is the only participant in the video still subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Kelly has since sued Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and the department for trying to demote his retirement rank and pay.
Slotkin said the controversy has brought increased threats against her and her family, including a bomb threat at her Oakland County property in the days after the video’s release.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-14 15:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Bridgeport Police Dept. drone proposal faces opposition,Eddy Martinez | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/14/bridgeport-police-dept-drone-proposal-faces-opposition/,Members of the city council’s Joint Committee on Contracts and Public Safety and Transportation overwhelmingly voted against the proposal.,"A recent push by the city to obtain two autonomous drones to aid first responders, faced a setback Tuesday night. Members of the city council’s Joint Committee on Contracts and Public Safety and Transportation voted against recommending a contract with Flock Safety, a surveillance company.
The committee overwhelmingly voted against the proposal, with only one yes vote and another member abstaining, to cheers from residents at a public meeting on the issue.
But Hector Soliman-Valdez, Flock Safety’s director of municipal engagement, isn’t discouraged.
“I think this is a normal part of the public process and we actually expected that,” Soliman-Valdez said.
The vote however, will not stop the city council from voting on the proposal later this month.
Despite the challenges, Soliman-Valdez said Flock Safety is looking forward to meeting with the community to discuss drone features.
Previous reporting by Connecticut Public highlighted concerns the drones may violate resident’s privacy by collecting data on them, which could inadvertently help federal authorities with deportation efforts.
Soliman-Valdez said sharing sensitive data violates company policy.
However, several city council members and residents said Flock Safety’s surveillance data was shared with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in other states.
Previous reporting by Virginia based WHRO indicates Flock Safety’s surveillance data, can be accessed by local police around the country, and was used by ICE in Virginia.
Soliman-Valdez pushed back on those claims saying the company does not share the information and that local police are responsible for how the information is utilized.
“All customers own their data, so Flock does not share any information so that’s unfortunately misinformation … we don’t police the police, so we create technology for police to use, to solve crime,” Soliman-Valdez said.
The crime fighting and first responder aspect of the drone systems were highlighted by Bridgeport city council member Aidee Nieves and Police Chief Roderick Porter.
Porter said the drones would act as a force multiplier. The city’s crime rate dropped last year, and Porter said the drones would help the city build on those successes. Its utility, he said, doesn’t just end with crime fighting. It could also help with firefighting.
Porter played a video, showing police officers entering a building on fire. But they didn’t go in blind, a Flock drone got there first. It helped officials plan out their next steps.
“The reason why we want Flock where we want drones in the city of Bridgeport is to enhance our ability to respond to calls, to provide a clearer view of what’s taking place prior to the officers getting on scene,” Porter said.
But residents like Todd Sample say their opposition to Flock is rooted in privacy concerns.
Sample said the potential for sensitive data ending up in the hands of federal law enforcement agencies also gives him pause. He referred to recent federal deportation efforts widely criticized for the use of surveillance tactics and a more violent and antagonistic response to protests, including the recent killing of a Minnesota woman by an ICE agent.
“We are facing an authoritarian type fascist regime where we’re having officers coming in fully masked, and they’re kidnapping people and they’re assaulting people,” Sample said.

In this society, your housing and your utility bills are affordable. You can live near where you work, and you have transportation options that meet your needs.
This imagined society sounds simple enough. So why is it out of reach for so many California residents? How can California policies help create more livable lives for Californians, where the essential needs – such as housing, education, and eldercare – are accessible and affordable for all? 
In the summer of 2024, the Possibility Lab invited public policy researchers from across California to share their ideas on addressing these questions. This collaboration has culminated in the Abundance Policy Report Series, featuring 12 original memos commissioned and edited by the Lab’s Abundance Accelerator. 
In this segment, we present the perspectives of three experts on housing, transportation, and energy: Paavo Monkonnen (housing), Juan Matute (transportation), and Keith Taylor (energy). 
How Scarcity is Built into Our Communities – and What Policy Can Do About It
Designing our cities, towns, and rural communities to better meet people’s needs requires moving beyond zero-sum thinking where your gain is my loss. It requires policies that challenge the status quo and re-examine how, what, why, and where infrastructure is built.


  


In housing, this means reimagining what makes a good home and enacting regulatory reforms that make it easier to build. To this end, Monkonnen argues that California needs a paradigm shift to improve the quality of multi-family housing (such as apartment buildings and duplexes) and course-correct from decades of policymaking that treated new housing as a ‘threat’ to neighborhoods of predominantly single-family homes. 
This paradigm shift, says Monkonnen, would prioritize building out the “missing middle” of housing so that new developments focus on housing stock somewhere between single-family homes and skyrise apartments. If California were to embrace this middle path in housing construction, then California residents could expect more medium-density, mixed-use neighborhoods that offer shared green spaces as well as new pathways to homeownership in multifamily buildings.
Likewise in transportation, Matute argues for a shift from prioritizing people rather than vehicles. This means worrying less about how many cars can travel on a given roadway and, instead, focusing on improving people’s access to whatever form (or combination) of transportation they need: whether by car, foot, bike, or public transit. 


  


In his report, Matute describes the geography of California in terms of “abundance hubs” that provide plentiful resources and “scarcity zones” that provide limited access to necessities like healthcare and healthy food. Accordingly, he suggests that transportation policy should be judged by how well it enables the flow of movement between scarcity zones and abundance hubs, so that residents without proximity to necessities can easily travel to get their needs met. While broader investments in scarcity zones are a necessary long-term project, transportation policy that expands the accessibility of essentials can improve equity in the near-term.


  


Similarly, to Taylor, abundance in the built environment is not just a matter of how we live and how we travel; it’s also about how we generate and distribute the energy that powers our daily lives. According to Taylor, California already has the raw renewable resources for clean energy abundance. What’s missing are the systems that can actually harness this potential and convert it into affordable utility bills for households across the state. The remedy, in Taylor’s view, is both technical and institutional: create a “Smart Grid” that enables a wider array of providers to contribute to clean energy production. California’s current system is a “hub-and-spoke” grid, where energy flows primarily from large, centralized power plants to consumers. In this model, it is difficult for smaller, local producers—for instance, a solar-equipped apartment building—to efficiently put excess power back into the system. 
A Smart Grid, powered by new digital technologies, creates a flexible network of connectivity, so that energy can move more dynamically between different producers and users. The result is less centralized control over California’s energy supply, and more opportunities for diverse actors to participate in renewable energy production.

People-Centered Policymaking in the Built Environment
The reforms these researchers suggest focus on a key idea: that the built environment is as much about infrastructure as it is about people. So what role should people play in designing and carrying out these visions for abundant housing, transportation, and energy? 
In the Possibility Lab’s Framework, the path to abundance is paved by a fundamental shift in the distribution of decision-making power. Without this shift, the status quo will likely continue enabling NIMBYism to block new housing and transportation while letting existing utilities continue to dominate the energy sector. 
To shift the balance of power and create constructive opportunities for people-centered policymaking, local and state governments might consider experimenting with changes to when and where public engagement happens. For example, rather than gathering input from neighborhood residents on a project-by-project basis, planning processes for new housing, energy, and transportation projects could be deliberated at a larger geographic scale and earlier in the planning process. 
The goal would be to encourage a broader range of views, focusing less on specific, individual cases that affect people personally and creating more opportunity to emphasize their community’s broader, shared goals. Figuring out whether this and other changes to the policy process can effectively contribute to different and more equitable outcomes is an important next step for California, and for other cities and states currently struggling with a widespread lack of affordability.
Whether we’re talking about housing, transportation, or energy, reforming public engagement processes is potentially a fundamental prerequisite for productive, people-centered policymaking that can turn visions of abundance into reality.

(Photo by Tek Images/ Science Photo Library/ Getty)Child sexual abuse material is illegal under both state and federal law. It has been for decades. But the advancement of Artificial Intelligence created loopholes. 
That was shown over the summer when a man in Maine used AI to manipulate pictures he took of children playing in a soccer game into sexually explicit images. Police knew who the man was and what he was doing but couldn’t charge him with a crime under Maine law, as first reported by the Bangor Daily News. 
A proposal before the Maine Legislature seeks to amend the criminal code so that charges in such cases can be brought. 
The bill, LD 524 sponsored by Rep. Amy Kuhn (D-Falmouth), expands the crime of disseminating child sexual abuse material to apply to materials that have been created or modified through generative AI or machine learning. 
“It’s not a hypothetical anymore,” Kuhn said. “This technology has created new ways to victimize children, and our laws haven’t been updated to adequately protect against that.”
Last year, following concerns that it wasn’t constitutional, lawmakers passed a watered down version, LD 1944, that added the dissemination of “morphed images” as a form of harassment under the “revenge porn” law. But now a broader proposal to expand the definition of sexually explicit material is back, and lawmakers from both parties seem open to it.
During the first week of this year’s legislative session, the Judiciary Committee advanced that bill in a unanimous bipartisan vote, sending it to the chambers, which are expected to take votes in the coming weeks. 
So far, 28 states have banned the creation of AI-generated child sexual abuse material, according to MultiState, a government relations firm tracking state AI laws. That includes nearby New Hampshire, where on Jan. 1 the use of artificial intelligence to create “intimate visual representation” of children became a Class B felony and a registrable offense. 
States are making these decisions despite President Donald Trump’s executive order in December that aims to preempt states from enacting rules governing AI. The move is a departure from the typical federalist structure of American government, where power is divided between the central government and states, and is likely to see legal challenges.
Maine State Police Lt. Jason Richards, who has investigated child sexual abuse and exploitation for 21 years, has seen the ways in which children can be victimized increase exponentially during that time, he told the Judiciary Committee in November. 
AI has been used to exploit children “in ways never seen before,” Richards said, and when it comes to scrubbing explicit images from the internet, “you can’t really put the genie back in the bottle.”
In 2024, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children received 67,000 reports of AI-generated child sexual abuse material and 485,000 reports by the first half of 2025, amounting to a 624% increase.
Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok on X, formerly Twitter, has recently faced global backlash for generating sexualized deepfakes of adults and children. 
However, U.S. officials are embracing it amid the controversy. On Monday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Grok will soon operate inside Pentagon networks. 
The bill in Maine was developed in collaboration with the Department of Public Safety. The Maine Chiefs of Police Association, Maine Prosecutors’ Association, Maine Coalition Against Sexual Assault and Maine Office of the Attorney General have publicly supported it.  
However, the Maine Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers is opposed, testifying that the bill is “well-intentioned but dangerously overbroad.”
Specifically, the bill redefines “child sexual abuse material” to include AI-created images that “appear to depict” a minor. The association argues that broad definition risks violating First Amendment protections because it could apply to non-obscene or artistic works that do not exploit an actual child. 
The association cited a 2002 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down portions of a federal child pornography law, deciding that the graphic manipulation of images, even if it makes it appear that children are engaging in sex, is legal and protected speech.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-932735996-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-14 09:57:39.992020

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)As the Trump administration chips away at longstanding childhood vaccine standards, a newly introduced bill in the Alaska Legislature would give state health officials the option of following vaccine advice of medical experts outside of the federal government.
The measure, House Bill 238, would authorize the state Department of Health to follow vaccine recommendations made by the American Academy of Pediatrics, not just the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee Immunization Practices.
The American Academy of Pediatrics opposes recent Trump administration changes to childhood vaccine recommendations and standards.
The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, said the bill would ensure that the state’s vaccination program continues to be guided by the best available science.
“What the bill would do is give the state some flexibility to continue to follow vaccine schedules that are based in science,” said Gray, who is a physician assistant by profession.
It is appropriate to modify vaccine schedules and policies based on new knowledge, Gray said. But the recent changes to the childhood vaccination recommendation and schedules “are politically driven, not driven because of new scientific information,” he said.
In December, the Trump administration’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ditched the longstanding U.S. recommendation for universal Hepatitis B vaccination of newborns. Committee members were appointed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine critic who fired the previous members en masse in June.
The president of the American Academy of Pediatrics called the change to Hepatitis B vaccine recommendations “irresponsible and purposely misleading guidance” that will lead to more infections of infants and children.
On Jan. 5, the U.S. Department of Health and Social Services released new guidelines that significantly cut the recommended doses and types of vaccines for children. Vaccinations for Hepatitis A and B, respiratory syncytial virus and meningococcal disease will be among those recommended only for children in high-risk groups, according to the new policy.
The American Academy of Pediatrics opposes that change as well.
The department’s announcement “to arbitrarily stop recommending numerous routine childhood immunizations is dangerous and unnecessary,” the academy’s president said in a statement.
Other medical organizations gave similar assessments.
Dr. Ronald G. Nahass, the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, called the Department of Health and Human Services’ changes to the vaccine schedule “drastic” and criticized the agency’s lack of transparency or clear scientific justification. In a statement, he said it is “the latest reckless step in Secretary Kennedy’s assault on the national vaccine infrastructure that has saved millions of lives. His actions put families and communities at risk and will make America sicker.”
Trump administration officials said the reduced childhood vaccination schedule puts the United States on par with many other industrialized nations. In particular, they cited Denmark’s vaccine practices as a model.
“After an exhaustive review of the evidence, we are aligning the U.S. childhood vaccine schedule with international consensus while strengthening transparency and informed consent. This decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health,” Kennedy said in a Jan. 5 statement.
Kennedy is a critic of vaccines. He has canceled funding for vaccine research. In Anchorage last summer, he claimed the COVID-19 vaccines actually prolonged the pandemic.
Gray said he and other health providers have concerns that more severe changes to vaccine policies may be coming under Kennedy’s leadership. For example, antivaccine activists who support the secretary have used rhetoric attacking basic vaccines that prevent polio, measles, mumps and rubella, he said.
“Because there’s been talk about those, I think we’re kind of on pins and needles that changes could be made to the most essential vaccines for public health,” Gray said.
Alaska’s immunization program provides universal access to vaccines that are purchased by the state in bulk. The money-saving bulk purchases were established by a bill that state lawmakers passed unanimously in 2014.
Alaska is already deviating from last month’s change to Hepatitis B vaccination recommendations.
State health officials announced on Dec. 29 that the state still recommends universal Hepatitis B vaccinations for newborns.
Alaska has a higher-risk status for the virus that warrants an exception from the new general recommendations, state health officials said. There is a history of high levels of childhood Hepatitis B in Alaska that the state eventually controlled through decades of screening and vaccination. Prior to vaccination, Western Alaska had the world’s highest rate of childhood liver cancer related to Hepatitis B infections.
Despite its successes in curbing childhood exposure to the disease, Alaska continues to have high rates of Hepatitis B among adults. Alaska’s rate of chronic Hepatitis B is nearly three times the national rate, according to health officials.
Other regions of the Arctic have also had extremely high rates of Hepatitis B, with experiences similar to those in Alaska. In Greenland, for example, vaccination of babies within 24 hours of birth has been routine since 2010, following Alaska’s practice.
Gray’s bill is one of several filed in advance of the 2026 legislative session, which starts on Jan. 20.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard summed up Kansas Democrats’ 2026 session goals with a familiar refrain: “affordability, affordability, affordability.”
That message was echoed by Florida House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell, Oregon House Majority Leader Ben Bowman and New Jersey Senate Majority Whip Vin Gopal on a webinar to preview the 2026 legislative sessions that was hosted Tuesday by NewDEAL Leaders — a group of center-left state and local leaders.
All panelists aimed to achieve the same goal through slightly different means adapted to their states.
Woodard, a Lenexa Democrat, proposed giving renters 15% of their rent back through a tax rebate, expanding Medicaid, eliminating the copay for free and reduced school lunches and more. Most of his proposals were a reprisal from a Monday press conference where Kansas House Democrats revealed their policy goals for the session.
Woodard talked about Democrats’ road trip last year to hear from constituents — called the “Fight Back Tour” —  and what he heard from Kansans.
“After announcing our legislative agenda, there were a couple Republicans who made side comments about how, ‘Oh, here go the Democrats again with their affordability talking points,’ ” Woodard said. “And I was able to push back and say, ‘No, this is what your constituents in your district told us they care about.’ ”
Woodard said the Democrats are geared up to fight for causes Kansans value. 
Kansas Republicans’ “No. 1 issue is banning trans Kansans from being able to get driver’s licenses, while we’re focused on making sure that people have access to homes, health care and education,” Woodard said.
Kansas Republicans have outlined a few goals for the session — such as curbing property taxes and embracing President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act — but a bill barring Kansans from changing gender markers on their driver’s licenses received a hearing Tuesday, the second day of the session.
Woodard talked about reframing Democrats’ arguments to fit residents’ values. He wants Democrats to find a “bumper sticker” to start an argument with, rather than getting into the weeds. He used school vouchers as an example.
“Lets stop with what you want the headline to be,” Woodard said. “Because what we know in western and central Kansas is without their public schools, without Friday night lights, they don’t have much of a community. And that’s the heart of their community, they love that. 
“So when we say, ‘They want to defund your kid’s football team,’ Kansas voters start listening. If we talk to them for 15 minutes about why vouchers are bad, we’ve already lost the argument.”
A big goal for Democrats this year is to break Republicans’ supermajority in the November midterms. They had the same goal two years ago, but the 2024 election resulted in Republicans expanding their supermajority. Florida had the same results, with Florida Republicans gaining more power.
Even with Florida’s current legislative makeup, Driskell said she is optimistic. 
“I do think there’s an opportunity to pick up some seats,” Driskell said. “Because the winds are shifting. I think 2026 is a change environment. It feels akin to 2018 in Florida, when we picked up seven seats in the Florida House.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1120035-1024x656.jpg,,,2026-01-14 09:57:39.992020
,CommonWealth Beacon,2026-01-14 14:06:15+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Massachusetts set out to modernize its unemployment insurance system. Then it hit a new low.,Jordan Wolman and Chris Lisinski,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/government/state-government/massachusetts-set-out-to-modernize-its-unemployment-insurance-system-then-it-hit-a-new-low/,Massachusetts was the slowest state in issuing initial unemployment payments in the country between June and October.,"WHEN ANDREA RUSSO lost her job this past summer, she needed money, and she needed it fast.  
Russo, a single mother who worked for Microsoft out of its Cambridge office, was abruptly let go as part of widespread downsizing throughout the company. After the tech giant cut her position, Russo had to rent out her house while she and her daughter, a high school senior, moved in with a friend. Her son who recently graduated from college is taking on a greater share of his student loans than was initially planned. Russo has had to dip into her savings account each month to live while she continues to look for full-time work in a tough job market — and fight what’s been an exhausting battle against state bureaucracy to get the unemployment insurance benefits she needs.
Five months later, she’s still fighting.  
After weekly calls to the Massachusetts Department of Unemployment Assistance (DUA), being placed on hold for 45 minutes, in-person visits to state offices, and being told that “we’re escalating” the situation too many times to count, Russo is still without a full-time job and without financial support. She initially filed for benefits with the state in August, according to a copy of her claim viewed by CommonWealth Beacon, yet she hasn’t received a dime in unemployment insurance benefits and is still without so much as a tangible status update about where her case stands and what issues are preventing the money from being disbursed.  
“I’ve never been unemployed before. I’ve had a job since I was 14 years old,” said Russo, a Rhode Island resident who filed for unemployment in Massachusetts because that’s where she was employed. “For once in my life, I need help, and I just feel let down.” 
Russo’s claim is just a fraction of the mounting cases that piled up at the DUA over the better part of 2025, where an unemployment system that was already falling short of key federal performance metrics stumbled into a new crisis.  
In each month between June and October, at least 4 in 10 new unemployment claims filed in Massachusetts by eligible workers went unpaid for 35 days or longer, according to federal data.  
By that measure, Massachusetts was the worst-performing state in the nation over that span. 
Anywhere from one-fifth to one-third of new claims in each of those months still hadn’t been paid within 70 days, forcing thousands of people to wait more than two months for aid to which they believe themselves entitled. 
Ironically, it was the state’s implementation of a new system meant to modernize and streamline the delivery of unemployment benefits that prompted the meltdown. A confluence of factors emerged: The new system’s technology, which includes enhanced tools for fraud prevention, led to a steep jump in the number of issues flagged in claimants’ applications, and it took significantly longer for claimants to get hearings to resolve those issues, just as DUA staff underwent required trainings on the new platform that took them away from their normal duties.  
The Healey administration kicked off the new system in May, featuring 140 new call center agents that drastically cut wait times and greater accessibility of the online portal through mobile phones and in multiple languages. The upgrades were one part of a larger, multi-year effort to update the unemployment insurance system and turn Massachusetts into one of the “top performing states” with “national leadership,” according to the Healey administration. 
“DUA is committed to improving operations and communication with impacted workers and employers, and the launch of this new, modernized [unemployment insurance] system marks a major milestone in our efforts to serve customers,” Secretary of Labor and Workforce Development Lauren Jones, who oversees the state’s unemployment insurance system, said in a statement at the time.  
But things quickly went awry.  
A federal performance standard calls on states to aim for making at least 93 percent of initial payments within 35 days. At various times over the past three decades, Massachusetts dipped below that target, but never as sharply for as long a stretch as it did last year. 
Last April, the state paid roughly three-fourths of initial claims within 35 days. In May, the month the new system went into effect, the rate dropped to 69 percent; by September, it had fallen as low as 42 percent, the worst single month on record in Massachusetts since 1997, the earliest year for which data is available. 
Massachusetts was the slowest state in issuing initial unemployment payments in the country between June and October. The Bay State’s unemployment rate held steady during that period, while claims saw a modest increase that was far less dramatic than in previous years more affected by COVID-19. 
Evan Murphy, a principal at Unemployment Tax Control Associates in West Springfield, described the situation as “a little bit of a perfect storm.” 
UTCA is a third-party administrator that handles unemployment insurance on behalf of about 300 Bay State employers. On multiple occasions in recent months, Murphy said, his firm has interacted with former workers who were told by DUA that their case is stalled because the state is still waiting for an employer to provide more information. 
“I can see in a lot of cases that we responded, like, a month ago with everything that they’ve asked for, and there’s nothing that is still due,” Murphy said in an interview. “I don’t know why [the state is] saying that, or if they’re buying themselves time, or whatever the case may be. It creates a strain on employers, and claimants don’t necessarily have a lot of answers, and I feel bad for them.” 
The debacle led DUA to launch a three-month pilot program in August to close call centers on Fridays to allow workers to “process claims faster.” The state said the pilot has been successful, reducing issues associated with individual claims by nearly 58 percent, while staff at the same time handled double the amount of calls compared with the prior year. The state extended those call center changes in the pilot program through the end of March on account of its success. 
The agency is also in the process of hiring 29 adjudicators and 150 seasonal employees to help process claims and staff the call center.  
“DUA is committed to making sure eligible claimants receive payment as soon as possible because we know they rely on these funds to make ends meet and [to] provide support during times of transition,” Matt Kitsos, a DUA spokesperson, said in a statement. “Over the past several months, DUA recognized a drastic need to adjust operations to improve customer experience and process claims more efficiently, which led to the implementation of major initiatives and operational enhancements with significant progress underway. We know we have more work to do and we remain committed to doing so.” 
Kitsos said the US Labor Department metrics themselves, while an important tool, may not “fully reflect the truth strength or health of an organization.” He said that while DUA was closer to meeting federal timeliness standards in early 2025, DUA was carrying a significantly higher backlog than it currently is, something not necessarily captured in the federal data, which only measures the timeliness of initial payments once that money goes out the door. 
State lawmakers, having faced the wrath of their constituents over long wait times, remain on edge over the situation, though they largely have kept their concerns behind closed doors rather than flex oversight muscle. 
Sen. Jacob Oliveira, a Democrat from outside of Springfield who co-chairs the Labor and Workforce Development Committee, told CommonWealth Beacon that “we’re not out of the woods yet” and he suspects upcoming hearings on the state’s annual budget will feature “tough questions” related to the unemployment benefits situation. 
But lawmakers have not yet scheduled any hearings on the next budget debate, which Gov. Maura Healey will kick off with a proposal due later this month. Last year, the first budget hearing took place March 6; if Beacon Hill keeps that pattern again this time around, lawmakers wouldn’t get a chance to ask “tough questions” until roughly three-quarters of a year after the UI platform change that triggered the crisis. 
“This new system was designed to support and make it easier for residents to actually get their unemployment claims processed, and when it was rolled out, it was not rolled out in a way that was acceptable,” Oliveira said. 
But he said it appears the situation may be improving, pointing to fewer complaints from constituents in recent weeks. He also offered robust support for Jones, arguing that wait times have been too long for claimants for decades. (Data show that while the system has had periods of delays in the past, the tail end of 2025 was a historic low.) 
The unprecedented breakdown is leading others, however, to question those in charge, and it could create an election-year headache for Healey. 
“Making sure that people who lose their jobs get timely unemployment insurance benefits is a core public service,” said Evan Horowitz, executive director at the Center for State Policy Analysis at Tufts University, who previously served on the state’s special commission on the unemployment insurance trust fund. “It’s shocking that we are failing to provide it, and I can’t shake the sense that it reflects a real leadership failure at the agency.” 
The Healey administration did not make Jones available for an interview upon request.  
At the time of publication, Massachusetts remained the only state in a federal database without November first-payment timeliness statistics. 
Kitsos said the Healey administration provided the relevant information to the federal government after some initial technical issues on the federal side, but can’t speak to why the federal database has not been updated to reflect the state’s data. 
DUA officials also provided CommonWealth Beacon with additional data demonstrating the department’s performance at processing all claims, including denials. That’s a more detailed universe than the federal data, which captures only initial payments made in cases involving eligible applicants. 
In July, about 47 percent of all claims — both those that were paid, and those that were denied — were processed within 21 days, DUA data show; by November, the share had risen to nearly 58 percent, reflecting some improvement. 
Even before the latest problems erupted, unemployment insurance in Massachusetts had long been a source of discontent. 
The state has had to contend with unemployment fraud, which soared nationwide during the pandemic and later specifically targeted Massachusetts in 2023, triggering extra security checks that slowed processing times for claims. A 2024 state audit also documented issues at DUA, including the payment of benefits to individuals while they were incarcerated. 
More recently, the Trump administration cut $400 million in federal unemployment insurance funding for states. Kitsos, the DUA spokesperson, cited declines in federal funding and a rise in unemployment fraud nationwide as challenges, conceding that the launch of the new system presented a “learning curve” associated with new “workflows and expectations” for staff and claimants. 
While the federal government funds the administrative side of states’ unemployment insurance programs, Massachusetts businesses fund the actual joblessness benefits in the state through taxes they pay. Those businesses have for decades lamented the high costs of providing that aid, which is arguably the most generous in the country. 
A surge of unemployment early in the COVID-19 pandemic overloaded the system. Massachusetts borrowed money to ensure it could keep up with the record demand, and employers continue to owe hundreds of millions of dollars per year more to repay that balance. 
Businesses are also preparing to be on the hook for another sizable debt. The Baker administration mistakenly used federal pandemic funds to cover unemployment benefits that should have been paid with state dollars. Healey last year announced a $2.1 billion settlement with the federal government that reduced what Massachusetts owes and spread the repayment out over a decade. 
Healey pledged that businesses would not face higher unemployment insurance taxes as a direct result of the agreement through at least the end of 2026. That’s little comfort to many employers because, due to economic factors and the trust fund’s shaky outlook independent of any federal debt, employers are already facing a series of increases in the rates they pay, forecast to reach the maximum allowable level starting in 2028.  
The governor last year said she would task Jones and her budget chief, Matthew Gorzkowicz, with convening a series of conversations about how to reform the system, but it’s not yet clear what — if any — action that will produce. Prior state efforts to build consensus for unemployment changes fizzled. 
“[The Department of Unemployment Assistance] has been not run well, and I think part of that is because of some sort of philosophy – from Democrat and Republican administrations alike – that it does not have to be because it’s not funded by rank-and-file voters and taxpayers,” said Retailers Association of Massachusetts president Jon Hurst, who’s been closely involved in discussions about big-picture reforms. “Employers are taxpayers as well and deserve to have a well-run system.” 
“Are we close to coming forward with a real plan of action? I’m not overly optimistic that will happen prior to an election, but hopefully, before taxes spike, particularly a year from now, a roadmap will be written,” he added.  
The downturn in DUA’s performance in 2025 has been particularly sharp, and it isn’t limited to payment timeliness alone. 
DUA is also dramatically below the federal performance standards for issuing “nonmonetary determinations” within 21 days of the date of detection of an issue that could impact a claim, like questions around how and why the claimant lost their job and whether the claimant is actively looking for work. 
Though Massachusetts wasn’t meeting that benchmark even before the new system took effect in May, DUA’s ability to issue these determinations got dramatically worse after the fact. The feds say 80 percent of determinations should be made within 21 days; in October, Massachusetts made just 43 percent of one category of nonmonetary determinations within 70 days — achieving roughly half of the target in more than three times the duration. The raw number of another category of nonmonetary issues increased dramatically, tripling from just over 7,000 in April to more than 21,000 in October, the second-most on record in state history. 
And the number of appeals pending a hearing decision more than quadrupled immediately after the new system was installed in May, according to Labor Department data. In April, DUA reported just shy of 2,000 such appeals. The next month, it spiked to 6,364 and reached over 8,000 in June before continuing to balloon to 9,631 in August — the most since January 2023. 
“We remain deeply concerned by the ongoing delays claimants are facing when attempting to access unemployment insurance benefits,” Jason Salgado, a staff attorney at Greater Boston Legal Services, said in a statement, adding that “performance data and the challenges claimants continue to experience underscore the need for [DUA] to better understand, provide additional clarity regarding, and take more urgent action to address the root causes of these delays and barriers.” 
The state’s program, experts said, is at legal risk due to its poor performance. Claimants could sue DUA, for instance, for failure to meet payment timeliness requirements.  
That’s what happened in Alabama in 2022 after a lengthy unemployment upheaval there. After a long legal fight, a state judge threw out the case in October. 
“Making sure that people who lose their jobs get timely unemployment insurance benefits is a core public service. It’s shocking that we are failing to provide it, and I can’t shake the sense that it reflects a real leadership failure at the agency.” Evan Horowitz, executive director at the Center for State Policy Analysis at Tufts University, who previously served on the state’s special commission on the unemployment insurance trust fund
The US Labor Department could withdraw all funding for DUA for noncompliance, though that has never happened before to any state because of the catastrophic consequences that would result, said Amy Traub, a senior researcher and policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project. 
DUA said the Labor Department has not issued any warnings or threats with regard to how it has administered unemployment insurance benefits in recent months. But the agency has reached out to the feds for “technical assistance on how states are expected to meet timeliness standards while still taking the necessary measures to prevent and detect fraud and have also adequate investigation time to ensure proper pay,” said Kitsos, the spokesperson. 
Both the political and administrative battles over the state’s unemployment system could continue into 2026 as Healey advances her reelection bid. 
Even though DUA is encouraged by recent data showing improvements in November, there’s concern that any reprieve could be short-lived if underlying issues with the new system persist. Unemployment claims nationwide, including in Massachusetts, regularly climb in the winter months. 
Then there’s the longer-term outlook. Even if nearly all checks started flowing out on time once again, the system would still face the long-term deficit exacerbated by the Baker administration’s mishandling of federal pandemic funds.

Any attempt to rebalance it could prove politically toxic because unemployment reforms are, essentially, a zero-sum game: Most changes that would be more favorable to the employers who fund jobless aid would be less favorable to the out-of-work Bay State employees who need the benefits like Russo, who is still reeling from her inability to receive unemployment insurance for nearly half a year. 
“[This] is costing employers, and at the same time, you’re finding out that the claimants aren’t being paid timely,” said Murphy, the unemployment insurance third-party administrator. “The system is just not really working for any of the stakeholders.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DUA.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-14 09:57:39.992020

Seventy years ago, every gas appliance in the Commonwealth was converted—house by house, street by street—to a cleaner, safer fuel. This transition was planned, coordinated, and universal.  
Today, as gas becomes more and more expensive, the Department of Public Utilities faces a choice: proactively lead the next transition, as it did before, or let gas utilities trap customers in a failing system. Much of this hinges on the meaning of a key legal phrase invoked by utilities — “obligation to serve” — the idea that, as publicly regulated entities, they are required to provide service to all who want it. That phrase is now at the center of a high-stakes showdown over a 2024 climate law enacted by the Massachusetts Legislature.  
We once had a different fuel running through pipes to Massachusetts homes – “manufactured gas,” which was made from pressurized steam pushed through crushed coal. It had a different chemistry, color, and energy intensity. The level of impurities varied, and occasionally people died from the carbon monoxide.  
After World War II, a new type of gas became available, extracted through drilling into underground deposits. This “natural gas” had fewer dangerous impurities and delivered twice the energy for the same cost.  
Transmission pipelines reached Boston in 1953. Utility workers went from street to street to perform the needed changes. Residents opened their doors willingly since they were told ahead of time that this would reduce their bills and improve safety. Once inside, the workers retrofitted every gas appliance: stoves, water heaters, and boilers.  
Crews returned repeatedly until all the work was complete. That was how seriously the industry took its responsibility to serve the public. As John Bacon, the one-time president of Boston Gas, later recalled: “We had a couple of situations where we had to break in to get the appliances converted.” 
State regulators approved having gas customers pay for these and other system-wide changes, since moving to a safer and more affordable system was in the public interest for all. 
Fast forward to the present day, and it’s a very different picture. Gas use in Massachusetts homes has dropped 25 percent since 1990. This stems from the general trend of warmer winters, energy efficiency, and electric heat pumps – which have been outselling gas boilers for years, since they provide cooling along with heating.  
This decline will probably accelerate, because heat-pump customers can now pay a lower electric rate, making their heating bills roughly the same as with gas. 
Regulators see where this is headed. If the gas system stays the same size with the same fixed costs, with less gas sold over time, each unit of gas will cost more and more. Rising costs will encourage customers to defect faster, until the only ones left will be those who can’t install a new electric heating system: low-income homeowners and renters.         
Regulators are requiring gas and electric utilities to plan how to rightsize the antiquated, declining gas system. Gas utilities are now allowed to convert whole streets to a geothermal network—like the one Eversource gas installed in Framingham as part of a pilot study—or to air-source heat pumps. Both methods are safer than gas, and provide cooling as well as heating, and cleaner air. With the new heat pump rate, customers on a geothermal network are likely to have much lower heating bills than with gas, these bills will have no price volatility (given that the energy is just beneath their feet, not tied to the global market like gas), and our energy dollars will stay in-state. 
But gas utilities – potentially resistant to change – are not reacting by installing as many geothermal networks as possible. Instead, they’re saying they have an “obligation to serve” and that if even one customer wants gas on a mile-long street, the pipe must remain – forcing every other gas customer in that utility’s territory to subsidize that customer‘s choice.         
However, the “obligation to serve” statute was amended in 2024. The change not only allows gas utilities to deny service to new customers, it allows gas utilities to discontinue service to an existing customer as long as the utility can ensure the customer has access to an alternative to heat their home, like electricity or geothermal energy. Although the amended law explicitly applies to “any person…in a town where a corporation is engaged in the…sale of gas or the distribution of energy,” gas utilities continue to insist that the law applies only to new customers.  
The dispute over the obligation to serve will be resolved by the Department of Public Utilities, probably near the end of 2026. The question is whether the DPU will concede to utilities, allowing them, for the first time, to lock customers into an increasingly expensive, unhealthy, and climate-damaging fuel —betraying the very purpose for which regulated utilities were created. 
Imagine a utility truck pulls up on your street in 2030. Technicians emerge, not to patch another gas leak, but to make final connections to the renewable thermal network. Down the street, a crew installs heat pumps, their work coordinated with the gas pipe decommissioning. 
A neighbor watches from her porch. A year earlier, she worried about losing her gas stove. But the utility company handled everything, and her new induction range heats faster, the heat pump keeps the house comfortable year-round, her bills dropped, and her child has fewer asthma attacks. The transition became manageable because it was planned, coordinated, and universal. 
This transition will happen. Gas use is declining, and that decline is about to accelerate. The only question is whether Massachusetts will manage it intelligently, as it has in the past, or will it let utilities trap customers in a system in decline.

Riding the momentum of a handful of successful pro-housing bills last year, some Democratic lawmakers are advancing a $10 billion bond proposal that aims to ease California’s housing crunch, writes CalMatters’ Yue Stella Yu.
Last week the Senate Housing Committee progressed a bill that would place the housing bond before voters during this year’s primary election. Seven billion dollars would go toward the state’s Multifamily Housing Program, which offers loans to low-income residents for rental housing. 
Another $2 billion would be allocated for rental assistance and affordable housing for low-income tenants and farmworkers, and the remaining $1 billion would assist low-income, first-time homebuyers with their down payments.

Sen. Chris Cabaldon, Napa Democrat and bill author, during a hearing last week: “Those homes don’t build themselves, and it’s time to finish the job. To unlock the full promise of these reforms requires cash.”

The bill is expected to be heard in the Senate Appropriations Committee next week and, if signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, would be placed on the ballot in June.
But the sailing hasn’t been smooth for other housing bills. On Tuesday a proposal that would have limited how much landlords can raise rents each year failed to garner enough “yes” votes in the Assembly Judiciary Committee.
Introduced last year by Assemblymember Ash Kalra, the bill faced strong opposition from a coalition of landlords and realtors who argued that the measure would make financing rental housing more difficult and squeeze mom-and-pop landlords.
Kalra, a San Jose Democrat who also serves as chairperson of the judiciary committee, told CalMatters that the bill failed because “we are listening to these wealthy landowners and apartment owners and not those that are literally struggling.”

Trump loses court case over transportation funds

President Donald Trump’s administration has stopped efforts to appeal a November court decision that prohibited it from withholding transportation funding from states that did not comply with its immigration enforcement policies.
By dropping its appeal Tuesday, the administration “concedes the case” in favor of California and more than a dozen other states that sued the administration, said California Attorney General Rob Bonta in a statement.

Bonta: “I am pleased that the Trump Administration has accepted defeat … We will continue taking the President to court each time he weaponizes federal funding to bully our communities.”

In April the U.S. Department of Transportation issued a directive attempting to hold hostage billions of dollars in federal transportation funding — which went toward public infrastructure such as roads, highways and bridges — to pressure states to cooperate with the administration’s immigration policies. Those included “not impeding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement” and not “taking action intended to shield illegal aliens from ICE detection.”
Arguing that Congress, not the president, had the authority to allocate federal dollars, California and other states filed suit. In November a federal court sided with the states, granting a permanent injunction to block the funds from being cut. In the ruling, a district judge said the federal transportation department “blatantly overstepped their statutory authority … and transgressed well-settled constitutional limitations on federal funding conditions.”



Air board proposes big emissions cuts

From CalMatters climate reporter Alejandro Lazo:
California regulators on Tuesday took a first step toward reshaping cap-and-invest, a key climate program and one of the state’s biggest sources of funding for projects ranging from zero-emission vehicles to high-speed rail and wildfire prevention.
Cap-and-invest limits greenhouse gas pollution by capping emissions and allowing companies to trade a limited number of permits with each other, rewarding those that cut emissions fastest.
The proposal unveiled by the California Air Resources Board would cut the supply of permits to drive emissions from the state’s largest polluters 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 and 85% by 2045. California’s 2022 climate blueprint called for steeper cuts, but regulators say rising consumer costs are a concern.
The board is expected to vote in May, setting up a debate between industry and climate advocates.
The program also funds high-speed rail and wildfire fighting efforts, including hundreds of millions for Cal Fire in Newsom’s proposed budget, unveiled last week.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Days before the Mississippi Department of Human Services director was ousted from his job in 2019, he was testifying to Congress about one of the very initiatives that landed him with a felony conviction in a now-infamous welfare theft scandal.
As director of the agency tasked with helping some of the neediest people in one of the poorest states in the country, John Davis had secured contracts for his new friend, former WWE wrestler Ted “Teddy” DiBiase, in 2018 to deliver leadership development workshops to state employees. 
And the reaction to their efforts was swell.
While testifying Tuesday in the criminal trial against DiBiase, Davis said he met with a top official at the attorney general’s office at the time, and they discussed including the attorney’s staff on DiBiase’s circuit. 
Davis said a director at the federal office that oversees the national Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant, which funded the DiBiase training, recommended that Davis expand the program.
Even a representative in Congress remarked during Davis’ testimony, “It’s interesting how well your program is working.”
DiBiase is facing 13 counts including conspiracy, wire fraud, theft and money laundering. But his defense lawyer’s cross-examination of Davis, which began Tuesday, revealed how much of the alleged scheme was carried out in broad daylight.
“Would you agree that if you were trying to hide something, you were going about it in a terrible way?” defense attorney Scott Gilbert asked Davis.
Davis said he thought everybody was aware of what he was doing, but that he “evidently” didn’t go about it the right way.
It was after delivering this answer, on his third day on the stand, that Davis displayed the largest emotion so far, his face puckering and voice cracking. The defense briefly halted its questioning for him to compose himself.
“Hindsight is 20/20 and until someone told me what conspiracy was, I would have told you I did exactly right,” Davis said earlier in the day. “When someone told me what conspiracy was, I admitted I did what I was told I did, so I have to accept responsibility. But my intention would have been as legal as possible.”
Davis pleaded guilty to state and federal charges in 2022 and he is cooperating with the prosecution as he awaits sentencing. DiBiase’s defense counsel is expected to resume cross-examination of Davis Wednesday.

Much of the defense’s questioning of Davis Tuesday touched on the difficulties he faced at the Byzantine welfare agency, with its outdated technology and constant political pressure.
One might think an agency with billion-dollar federal spending power would have automated spreadsheets in its accounting division, Davis said, but instead, employees used pencils on paper ledgers. 
“Sometimes the pencil stroke would be so light or wrong,” Davis said, that he personally witnessed a scenario in which a $2 million deficit was mistaken as a $200 million shortfall.
In an agency with a budget made up primarily of federal funding, subject to a maze of everchanging federal regulations, Davis relied on his executive staff, roughly 70 staff attorneys and several assistant attorneys general who were assigned to his agency to keep him on track.
Davis testified he was steered wrong on several occasions, leading to an inappropriate course of action. “You always lived on the edge, scared to death,” Davis said.
He was also appointed by the governor and had no civil service protection.
“I was at the whim and pleasure. I said ‘whim and pleasure,’ and that’s what it was,” Davis said.
This made him more susceptible to politics. Davis said he would travel to Washington to meet with Mississippi’s delegation and would visit state lawmakers at the Capitol in Jackson several times a week. When Gilbert suggested powerful people must have constantly been asking Davis to do things for them, Davis said he received 1,000 emails a day.
“Everything I did was influenced by a political process,” Davis said. 
His direct supervisor was then-Gov. Phil Bryant, a Republican who served from 2012 to 2020. Davis said he interacted with Bryant every day or most days.
“I learned that as an eligibility worker,” Davis said. “The only way things worked is to please your boss.”
It wasn’t about pleasing the people in need, the clients of the agency, Davis added.
“I know I’m saying something controversial,” he said.
When asked if he was able to carry out these directives, even the unpleasant ones, Davis responded, “No compunction about that. That was my job.”
Davis testified he was working under Bryant’s orders to outsource and consolidate functions of the agency when Davis authorized granting tens of millions of TANF dollars to just two nonprofits, one being Mississippi Community Education Center founded by Nancy New. 
New has also pleaded guilty in the scheme and is also awaiting sentencing.
Davis said Bryant and his wife had known New for years and would at times call New “rather than go through me.”
The subgrants with the two nonprofits, together dubbed Families First for Mississippi, presented the vehicle for officials to allegedly steer TANF money to their friends, family and celebrities without the kind of restrictions and oversight that would exist if the money came directly from the state agency.
This structure was underway by the time Davis met DiBiase, the defense pointed out Tuesday.  
Gilbert also strove to show that it would not be unusual for Families First to seek out celebrities like DiBiase to spread their message. Gilbert asked Davis to talk about the array of stars that Families First sought for endorsements, such as Oprah Winfrey or Morgan Freeman. Davis said he thought New had actually spoken with Winfrey “or her people.” 
Gilbert displayed reports of social media analytics showing that of MDHS-related posts, DiBiase’s tweet about his leadership development program received the most page views.
DiBiase called his training program, which he delivered to hundreds of employees until the Davis’ scheme collapsed under an auditor’s investigation, “Law of 16.”
“He had a fascination with the number 16,” Davis said.
“Fear is INEVITABLE,” reads screenshot from a power point former Mississippi Department of Human Services Director John Davis and wrestler Ted DiBiase Jr. used during their leadership training program called Law of 16.
The Law of 16 curriculum contains four types of self-help actions – love, yearn, fight, empower (LYFE) – among four areas of life – self, family, business, community – to create 16 different commands for living, according to an information packet.
Law 1, for example, is SELF+LOVE. 
Standing before a gospel choir in a banquet room at the Westin hotel in downtown Jackson during what the agency called the “Law of 16 celebration,”  Davis declared to the large crowd, “If we don’t know who we are, if we haven’t mastered self, we will never, ever master the master’s plan,” according to a video the welfare agency produced.
When Gilbert asked Davis if he ever offered, or if DiBiase ever requested, a “no work” contract, Davis said it was quite the opposite. If anything, he said, he probably invested too much of himself ensuring that DiBiase succeeded. 
Davis said he knew the situation was dysfunctional. Especially now, being on the other side of it, Davis said, “complicated, convoluted and crazy are terms that don’t even begin to describe it.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/13121041/John-Davis-DiBiase-trial-4.jpg,,,2026-01-14 09:57:39.992020

California Democrats are eager to advance a pair of bond measures to fund affordable housing construction, but lack enthusiasm for tenant rights protections as a controversial rent control measure bites the dust for a second straight year. 


California lawmakers showed historic enthusiasm for the abundance movement last year as they passed sweeping housing laws that roll back landmark environmental reviews for most urban developments and allow denser housing near transit — ambitious endeavors that would have gotten nowhere just a few years ago.
This year, housing advocates are trying to seize the moment again, particularly in the last year in office for the pro-building Gov. Gavin Newsom. 
Just days after returning to work, state lawmakers are already advancing a $10 billion bond that stalled last year to pay for new and existing affordable homes. The proposal, Senate Bill 417, cleared the Senate Housing Committee by an 8-1 vote last week and heads to the Senate Appropriations Committee next week. Lawmakers are seeking to put the measure on the June primary ballot, which would require the governor to sign it into law by Jan. 22.
“Those homes don’t build themselves, and it’s time to finish the job,” said Sen. Chris Cabaldon, a Napa Democrat who authored the legislation, during a hearing last week. “To unlock the full promise of these reforms requires cash. It requires sufficient capital, as it always has, to move these affordable housing projects from approval and permitting to construct.”
The bond measure would allocate $7 billion toward the state’s Multifamily Housing Program, which issues low-interest loans to build and maintain permanent and transitional rental housing for lower-income households. It also includes $2 billion for wildfire prevention, rental assistance and affordable housing for low-income tenants and farmworkers, as well as $1 billion in low-income first-time home buyer assistance, including help with down payments. 
The committee also approved a separate bond proposal to pay for housing for homeless youths, although lawmakers are looking to combine the bond measures. Sen. Caroline Menjivar, a Van Nuys Democrat who authored the proposal, said she’d “couch surfed” at age 19 when she became unhoused for a year and half. The money would help reduce homelessness by offering relief earlier in people’s lives, she said. 
“This is an investment that is really going to help us save money down the line,” she said.

The legislative appetite for housing bonds indicates another good year for pro-abundance advocates. They’ve already got the ear of the governor, who declared himself an ally of the “Yes In My Back Yard” movement by signing a flurry of bills last year to fast-track housing production, which the governor touted in his State of the State address last week. 
This year, the governor said, the Legislature should focus on reducing the cost of construction, “utilizing new building methods and technology” and passing “worker-centered reforms that bring our brothers and sisters in labor along with us.”
In February, Sen. Jesse Arreguín of Oakland, a renter who’s big on fast-tracking housing construction, will take the helm of the Senate Housing Committee. He will replace Sen. Aisha Wahab, a fellow renter and Fremont Democrat who has long criticized new construction without protection for low-income tenants. 
Bill to curb rent increase dies again
But efforts to champion tenant protections hit a major snag Tuesday when a controversial rent control proposal died in the Assembly Judiciary Committee. Assembly Bill 1157, introduced last year to further restrict how much landlords can raise the rent each year, failed to get enough votes Tuesday despite being authored by the committee chair, Democratic Assemblymember Ash Kalra of San Jose. 
The bill, sponsored by the tenant rights group Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment, would have tied the annual rent increase rate to the Consumer Price Index, which measures inflation, and capped it for most rental homes at 5%, instead of 10% under current state law. As a compromise, Kalra narrowed the bill on Tuesday to exclude single-family home tenants from the proposed rental relief in hopes of securing passage. Individual landlords of single-family homes aren’t subject to rent control under state law.  
“Tenants need a permanent solution, not a temporary fix,” Kalra said during Tuesday’s hearing.  “If we don’t act with urgency to help our tenants in crisis, we are going to continue to contribute to the risk of homelessness.”
The proposal stalled last year amid strong headwinds from a coalition of landlords and realtors led by the California Apartments Association. They argued Tuesday that the measure would discourage investment in rental housing and squeeze small landlords. Voters have rejected past rent control ballot measures, such as Proposition 10 in 2018 and Proposition 33 in 2024. 
The measure needed seven votes to advance but only got four, all from Democrats. All three Republican committee members voted against the bill. Five other Democrats — assemblymembers Rick Zbur of Los Angeles, Blanca Pacheco of Downey, Diane Papan of San Mateo, Catherine Stefani of San Francisco and Rebecca Bauer-Kahan of San Ramon — did not cast a vote, which effectively counts as a no vote. 
“That shows the power and influence of moneyed interests.”Assemblymember Ash Kalra, a Democrat who represents San Jose
Some of them, such as Zbur and Bauer-Kahan, expressed concerns during the hearing that the proposed law could hurt landlords. Rent hikes are caused by the state’s housing shortage, they argued, and the Legislature should instead focus on building more housing. 
Echoing similar concerns, Stefani’s spokesperson, Daniel Herzstein, said in a statement that a lower rent cap would risk squeezing landlords who already face rising costs. Pacheco was unsure how the bill would affect mom-and-pop property owners, said her spokesperson Alina Evans. Papan’s office did not immediately return a CalMatters’ request for comment. 
Lidya Morales, a 53-year-old single mom from San Diego with three kids, said her monthly rent increased from $1,300 in 2022 to $2,000 last year. She works at three different hotels to afford it, she said. Without the proposed rental relief, she said she fears getting priced out.
“I don’t want to live in my car with my kids,” she said.
Following the bill’s defeat, hundreds of tenants affiliated with ACCE broke into chants in protest. “Housing is a human right!” Some yelled. Others screamed “shame” at the near-empty committee dais after most lawmakers ducked out after the vote.
Kalra told CalMatters that the bill failed because “we are listening to these wealthy landowners and apartment owners and not those that are literally struggling.”
“I think that shows the power and influence of moneyed interests,” he said.
Taming unintended consequences
Apart from unveiling ambitious proposals, state lawmakers this year must also figure out how to clean up after new housing policies like Senate Bill 79, a controversial law authored by Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco that overrides local zoning restrictions to allow apartment buildings up to seven stories near major transit stations in metro areas. 
Lawmakers passed the law narrowly last year after it went through 13 rounds of amendments to quell criticism from a coalition of interest groups and state lawmakers, who sought more stringent environmental reviews, labor protections, affordable units and local control. 
But critics say the resulting law still has unintended consequences. 
Mobile home park residents in the Bay Area who live close to transit lines say the law makes them vulnerable to displacement by allowing their parks to be redeveloped into apartment complexes, a loophole that Wiener himself acknowledged.

Gail Rubino, a resident at the El Dorado Mobile Home Park in Sunnyvale, said at least 36 parks in six of the state’s most populous counties will be affected by the new law. If all were allowed to be redeveloped, more than 5,400 people would be displaced, she estimates. A new bill from Wahab, whose district includes many of the parks, seeks to shield mobile home parks from redevelopment into transit-oriented housing. 
“This lack of protection threatens existing affordable housing stock that SB 79 seeks to increase,” Rubino told lawmakers last week.
SB79 has caused confusion among local officials, who say the law is so vague that they cannot even agree on which counties it applies to. While Wiener has said it’s his intent to apply the new law to eight of the state’s most urban counties, local government associations insist only four fit the bill. Some local government agencies say they are afraid to adopt new zoning maps without clear guidance, worried it would result in litigation. 
Wiener said he will introduce new legislation later this year to clarify how counties should implement the new law.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/070822_Housing-Elk-Grove_RL_CM_21.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-14 08:57:26.185466

In recent months, a string of refinery fires, chemical releases and other disasters has put Californians on edge. Yet California regulators are quietly proposing to weaken the state’s safety rules in a secret deal with oil lobbyists — putting us all at greater risk. 
On Jan. 15, regulators will hold a public hearing at the state’s Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board meeting in Sacramento on changes to California’s Process Safety Management regulations, an issue with life-or-death consequences for workers and nearby communities.
These regulations exist to keep people safe. After the 2012 Chevron refinery explosion in Richmond sent a massive fireball into the sky and sent thousands of residents to seek medical help, California strengthened its refinery safety rules. 
The reforms established crucial safeguards: rigorous oversight of hazardous materials and processes, common-sense standards ensuring meaningful worker participation in safety processes and engineering reviews, and authority for workers to stop unsafe operations. 
We represent communities living next to refineries and the workers who operate them. Together, we are sounding the alarm — California must not allow oil billionaires and their lobbyists to rewrite refinery safety rules.
Recent disasters at refineries across California — including major fires and explosions in Martinez, Benicia and El Segundo in 2025 alone — show that the risks remain serious and urgent. 
As oil executives disinvest from maintenance at aging refineries, the risk of deadly disasters increases, making these regulations more important than ever.
Refinery disasters don’t just affect workers and local communities. They impact Californians across the state when we fill up our tanks. Major accidents often disrupt fuel supplies, driving up gasoline prices.
The proposed OSHA changes stem from a settlement between state regulators and oil industry lobbyists — a secret deal crafted behind closed doors, excluding workers and frontline communities. The changes would erode critical safety protections and give oil companies more control over the rules meant to hold them accountable.
The most dangerous change targets a crucial aspect of refinery safety, employee participation. 
The proposal would allow oil executives to handpick workers to participate in developing safety plans and conducting critical safety reviews. In practice, that means a worker who raises concerns about corroded pipes or unsafe chemical levels could be replaced with someone more willing to stay silent.
This defies common sense. Refinery workers are responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of these facilities. 
They know which metals are used in each process and how much acid or additives can be used. They know which chemicals corrode and rip holes through pipes. Their knowledge is essential to preventing disasters.
Other revisions would reduce oversight of hazardous chemicals, narrowing what companies are required to analyze and fix. 
These dangerous and carcinogenic substances don’t disappear just because we decide to look the other way. They remain on-site, threatening workers and surrounding neighborhoods.
Communities like Richmond and Carson are already deeply impacted by day-to-day refinery pollution. They experience elevated rates of asthma, cancer and other chronic illnesses. Explosions and toxic accidents exacerbate these risks. 
The existing safety rules were built with worker input for a reason. Refinery workers want safe jobs. Refineries are inherently hazardous, and a single failure can mean severe injury or death. Workers must be able to select their own representatives who understand refining processes, prioritize environmental health and safety and who will not cave to corporate pressure. 
Luckily, this deal can still be stopped. Governor Newsom’s regulators should reject these industry-driven rollbacks and work openly with workers and residents.
The future of safety at California’s refineries should be defined by public voices — not oil billionaires and their lobbyists.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/050924-Marathon-Refinery-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-14 08:57:26.185466

Newsom knows that being portrayed as a left-leaning cultural warrior from deeply blue California — a factor in sinking Kamala Harris’s White House bid — is potentially fatal.
Thus, Newsom’s final state budget takes on a new political meaning, and makes the always difficult process of weighing competing interests within the state even trickier than usual.
We saw that syndrome affect Jerry Brown, the last California governor to harbor serious presidential ambitions. In 1978, he opposed Proposition 13, the iconic tax cut ballot measure, but after its passage championed both a large state tax reduction and a spending limit ballot measure to realign himself with the tax cut movement.
Brown then tried to ride the anti-tax, spending-limit movement into the White House two years later — but failed miserably.
Back to Newsom.
His initial budget proposal, released last week, basically adopts the current spending plan, with a few tweaks that continue his ideological drift to the right. In hopes of producing a balanced budget, at least on paper, Newsom is cutting back on spending for social welfare and health care services and college scholarships.
Those steps alone are drawing criticism from many advocacy groups, but resistance is also heightened by his apparent unwillingness to fill in gaps caused by President Donald Trump’s cutbacks in federal support.
The reaction from left-leaning advocates was summarized well in a critique by Chris Hoene, executive director of the California Budget and Policy Center, an umbrella group of organizations that lobby for public services, especially those for the poor.
“California’s state budget is a reflection of our shared values and our responsibility to care for one another,” Hoene said in a statement. “Unfortunately, the governor’s 2026-27 spending plan balances the budget by dodging the harsh realities of the Republican megabill, H.R. 1, and maintains state cuts to vital public supports, like Medi-Cal, enacted as part of the current-year budget.
“Governor Newsom’s reluctance to propose meaningful revenue solutions to help blunt the harm of federal cuts undermines his posture to counter the Trump administration.”
Some budget critics want new taxes to both cover the state’s deficits and offset federal reductions. To fill those gaps, any new levies would need to generate somewhere around $30 billion a year.
“That means taking on corporations and billionaires, raising revenue instead of slashing budgets, and building a stronger California every step of the way,” the Legislature’s Progressive Caucus said in response to Newsom’s budget proposal.
Both of Newsom’s predecessors, Brown and Arnold Schwarzenegger, supported new taxes to close multibillion-dollar shortfalls. However, Newsom has repeatedly rejected any broad tax increases to close deficits.
Unions and other left-leaning groups are sponsoring two potential ballot measures to raise taxes. One would continue and expand a temporary tax hike on high-income Californians that Brown sponsored after returning to the governorship in 2011. The other proposal would levy a 5% tax on wealth of the state’s billionaires.
Newsom has promised that when he revises the budget in May, just a few weeks before it must be enacted, he will both balance it for the next fiscal year and attack the huge deficits that will linger after his governorship ends. The chances of doing that without new taxes of some kind are — to put it mildly — almost nil.
If Newsom continues to reduce spending on services for the poor and resist new taxes, his lame-duck status could draw unaccustomed resistance in the Legislature. Likewise, his presidential hopes might face opposition from progressive groups both in California and states that are important to a 2028 campaign.

Carlsbad homeowner John Levy is challenging a $2.4 million fine from the Coastal Commission over alleged beach access and environmental violations, arguing that while the underlying disputes are typical, the commission’s power to impose massive penalties without court oversight violates due process.


Carlsbad homeowner John Levy’s lawsuit against the Coastal Commission disputes penalties over two locked gates, native vegetation, a wedding site and pickleball court. It also challenges the commission’s authority to exact multi-million dollar fines without judicial review.
The commission, which protects public access and environmental quality in the Coastal Zone, a strip of land that follows California’s shoreline, accused Levy of blocking public access to the beach, removing shorebird habitat and illegally installing the pickleball court. It fined him $2.4 million for those offenses.
Levy contends the two gates that the commission wants him to open have complex property rights issues. He said he has honored environmental protections, and while he built the court without proper permits, he’s working with the city to fix that.
Those are ordinary matters before the commission, concerning how the public can access coastal property and what gets built there. But Levy’s complaint goes further, arguing that the powerful commission violated his due process rights by imposing steep fines without court oversight, and collecting penalties that fund its own programs. 
“They’re the investigator, they’re the judge, they’re the jury and also they’re the treasurer,” Levy said.
Commission staff and members did not respond to questions from CalMatters, citing the pending litigation. At the October hearing, Rob Moddelmog, enforcement counsel for the Coastal Commission, said Levy could have avoided the years-long conflict by complying with the California Coastal Act.
“At any point in that period of time, Mr. Levy could have simply opened his gate and removed his padlock from another gate within the easements, and removed development from the wetland buffer, and avoided this entire proceeding,”   Moddelmog told commissioners. “But after all this time, and after considerable effort by your staff, he has chosen not to.”
Trouble in Levyland
Levy’s property sits at the corner of Buena Vista Lagoon in Carlsbad. He bought the land and obtained a coastal development permit to build the estate he calls “Levyland” in 1998. Almost immediately he began feuding with the commission over permit conditions.
Nearly all beaches in California are open to the public, and the commission can order property owners to provide beach access across their land. Levy says the permit requires “lateral access,” meaning visitors can enter the beach from adjacent parts of the shoreline. The commission argues that doesn’t accommodate disabled beachgoers, and says Levy must provide access from the street, Mountain View Drive.
There are two paths that could allow beachgoers to get across Levy’s property. One is a road to the beach along Levy’s property, which is owned by the neighboring homeowners association. The other is a foot trail on his land, which travels along the lagoon. 
Both are blocked by gates that have been mostly closed for a quarter of a century, in violation of his permit, the commission said. 
“We’ve been asking Mr. Levy to comply with the coastal act and his (coastal development permit) for years, and he has refused,”  Moddelmog said. “And this is why we are forced to bring this order to you today to compel Mr. Levy to finally address his violations.”
Levy says he’s willing to provide public access but is hamstrung by ownership and easement issues. When he built the home, Levy installed a gate at the road to the beach, with permission of the HOA. Now he said he needs the association’s permission to remove the gate from its land.
He also agreed to give the city of Carlsbad an easement over the footpath, so visitors could walk to the beach. The commission maintains that the easement is in place, so the gate must be open. But Levy and Carlsbad officials say the city never accepted it.
“That’s one of the fundamental questions underlying this is whether there’s truly an easement in place,” said Jeremy Talcott, an attorney with the Pacific Legal Foundation, a public interest law firm that advocates for property rights and is representing Levy in this case.
Carlsbad officials didn’t comment for this story, citing pending litigation. But in a letter to the commission, Carlsbad community development director Jeff Murphy and city prosecutor Marissa Kaweki stated that Carlsbad questions the commission’s authority to require removal of the gate and said the city hasn’t approved the easement.
“The public currently cannot access this trail easement that has been offered because it has not been accepted by the city,” they wrote.
Levy is required to open the gate and provide trail access regardless of the city’s participation, commission staff argued. But without the city taking charge of safety and maintenance for the trail, it’s too much of a liability to let the public on his land, Levy said.
“If in fact I was guilty of blocking public access or not being compliant with my coastal permit, then I would have acquiesced, or settled,” he said. “But I didn’t.”
The commission also fined Levy for coastal development violations: unpermitted changes to his property.
His property fronts the lagoon on two sides, and provides habitat for the endangered light-footed Ridgeway’s rail, California least tern and light-footed clapper rail. He was required to provide a 100-foot buffer of native vegetation for shorebirds. The commission accused Levy, who now lives in New Zealand, of renting his home as a wedding venue and removing native vegetation to clear a parking lot for events.
He also built a pickleball court on the property without permission. Moddelmog said commission staff didn’t necessarily oppose that, but would have recommended siting it further from the lagoon.
Levy said he didn’t operate a wedding venue, but allowed weddings at his rental property. And he said he cleared invasive plants from the shoreline and replaced them with native seed mix. A self-described “avid pickleball player,” he acknowledged it was a mistake to build the court without permission, but is working to obtain an “after-the-fact” permit.
Nonprofits including Surfrider Foundation, Disability Rights California and Buena Vista Audubon urged the commission to approve penalties against Levy.
“It is time to put a stop to these egregious coastal access and wetland habitat violations, once and for all,” Surfrider officials wrote.
But Talcott said these questions of property law should be decided in court, not by the same government body that investigated the matter and issued the notice of violation.

“I don’t think that’s the sort of question that can be resolved in a commission hearing,” he said. “There’s not a neutral adjudicator in that hearing. They’re not a judge. They’re a commission tasked with maximizing public access, and empowered to investigate, prosecute and judge violations of the Coastal Act.”
Who should adjudicate coastal conflicts?
For more than half a century, the Coastal Commission has protected coastal ecosystems and kept beaches open to all Californians. Critics say it has also restricted housing construction in coastal areas and gained sweeping authority to impose steep fines.
The commission can fine property owners $11,250 per day for each violation, for up to five years. In long-running disputes that can run up to millions or even tens of millions of dollars.  In Levy’s case, Moddelmog said staff “recommends a conservative approach” and grouped all his alleged public access violations into one penalty of $1 million and the coastal development violations into one fine of $1.4 million.
The penalties lack the due process protections of criminal court proceedings, Levy argued in his complaint. For instance, commission hearings don’t include the right to testify under oath, authenticate evidence or subpoena and cross-examine witnesses, Talcott said.
“It has none of the procedures involved in a criminal hearing,” he said.
The commission also has a conflict of interest in adjudicating its own penalties, the complaint argues, since the money collected from those fines funds its own enforcement and other programs.
Mary Jo Wiggins, a law professor at University of San Diego who specializes in real estate and land use, said it’s not uncommon for regulatory agencies to administer costly fines. 
“Public bodies are making decisions that are similar in nature to what the California Coastal Commission is doing here,” she said. “It’s really more a matter of the scope of their power rather than whether they have the power to do this or not.”
For instance, the California Air Resources Board may rely on administrative law judges in lieu of civil court proceedings to impose fines totalling up to $100,000, or $300,000 for some fuel violations. In 2023 the legislature authorized the State Water Resources Control Board to fine water violators up to $10,000 per day plus $2,500 for every acre-foot of water taken.
Levy’s complaint argues that the seven-figure fines against him amount to “quasi-criminal” penalties that should receive judicial oversight. Wiggins said that’s a credible argument.
“They’re not just compensatory, they’re punitive,” she said. “That requires a higher level of review that the commission doesn’t provide because it’s reviewing its own fines.”
If the case isn’t resolved in their favor, Talcott said Levy and the foundation will appeal to the state or even federal Supreme Court.
Case precedent may not be in Levy’s favor. In 2016 the Coastal Commission fined Warren and Henny Lent $4.185 million for coastal access violations at their Malibu home. In 2021 an appeals court upheld the penalty, and the state and federal Supreme Courts declined to review the case.
Levy said he’s prepared to go as far as he can to challenge the Coastal Commission.
“I’m 74 and I don’t care how much I have to spend, but I’m going to bring this to the forefront of The U.S. and California,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/072523_Del-Mar-Coast-Erosion_AH_CM_004.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-14 12:58:32.206113

(Photo by David Abbott/Arizona Mirror)Nevada lawmakers are once again taking the lead in a bipartisan effort to reverse a court ruling adopting a stricter interpretation of a 150-year-old federal mining law.
Mining developers in the West have grappled with the aftermath of a 2022 Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that essentially restricted mining companies from dumping waste on federal lands where they did not have a valid mineral claim – a practice that had gone on unimpeded for decades.
While federal mining law allows companies to mine on federal land if they have a valid mining claim, the federal court decision ruled that companies are not guaranteed the right to use adjacent federal land without valuable minerals for related mining purposes – such as waste rock disposal or running power lines.
The Mining Regulatory Clarity Act of 2025 — introduced by Republican Rep. Mark Amodei — passed the Republican-led House of Representatives with a 219 to 197 vote during the lame-duck session in December.
While the legislation passed mostly along party-lines, the bill picked up nine Democrats, including Nevada’s Rep. Steven Horsford, a cosponsor of the bill. Only one Republican voted against the bill, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania. 
Nevada’s other Democratic Representatives, Susie Lee and Dina Titus, have raised concerns with the bill’s broad language, and voted against its passage last month. 
Western legislators have largely led the effort to reverse the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals “Rosemont decision” which found that the federal government erred when it approved the Rosemont Copper Company’s plan to dump mining waste on U.S. Forest Service land in Arizona where the company could not prove they had a valid mineral claim.
“The Mining Regulatory Clarity Act restores decades of established precedent, repairs a permitting process undermined by the Rosemont decision, and gives domestic mining operations the certainty they need to compete aggressively and win,” said Amodei in a statement on its passage.
The bill would essentially reverse the ruling by removing a provision in the General Mining Act of 1872 that mining companies must show a mineral deposit is present before building roads and other support facilities at a potential mining site. The bill would also create an abandoned hard rock mine fund to support reclamation programs.
“Streamlining the hardrock mining process will create good jobs and strengthen our energy sector. At the same time, this legislation delivers more resources for the Silver State to clean up past mining-related contaminants in our environment,” Horsford said in a statement on its passage.
Last year, Amodei introduced a similar bill which also passed the Republican-controlled House and was included in a larger mining reform package in the Senate. But that package, shepherded by former independent U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, fell apart during the lame duck session despite a strong bipartisan desire to implement permitting reform.
Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is sponsoring a companion bill in the Senate, which passed the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in April of 2025. Cortez Masto’s office said the state’s senior senator will “continue exploring all avenues to move it forward in the Senate.”
House Committee on Natural Resources Chairman Republican Rep. Bruce Westerman said “the ramifications of the Ninth Circuit’s decision are substantial,” and urged the bill’s passage. 
“Although the Rosemont decision involved Forest Service lands, it has prompted multiple lawsuits targeting projects on BLM lands based on similar regulations,” he continued.
During debate on the House floor, California Rep. Jared Huffman questioned the notion that the Rosemount decision created significant roadblocks for the mining industry, adding he has “found no evidence that any mines are currently being held up because of the Rosemont decision anywhere in America.”
“You know what happened to the Rosemont mine after that court decision came down? The next day, the company paid for private lands for its waste disposal. Zero problem. The mine wasn’t stopped. It’s just the industry would prefer to use the public lands, your lands, and to be able to dump for free,” Huffman said on the House floor.
Huffman said several Democrats have offered several amendments to Republican leadership that would improve the bill and prevent foreign mining companies from abusing the General Mining Act of 1872.
Lee, who represents Nevada’s second district, said she supports a “Rosemont fix” but that the bill required more clarity to get it “through the Senate and to the President’s desk.”
“While I appreciate the significant improvements made to this legislation, further tightening some of the language in the bill will be essential to preventing potential abuse and misuse,” Lee said.
Lee proposed an amendment that would limit “impacts to lands that are actually necessary for mining operations” and clarify that the federal government has the authority to regulate mining on all of the public lands in its care, but that amendment was rejected.
“If my amendment had been included, I would have voted in support of the legislation,” Lee said.
On the House floor, Democrats also argued Amodei’s bill would only benefit the mining industry by making it easier for companies to develop sites without documented mineral deposits. Huffman said the bill would give too much power to — and provide too little accountability for — mining companies that already work in a favorable regulatory environment.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/copper-world-rosemont-hudbay-operations-scaled-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-14 08:57:26.185466

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The Utah Legislature is picking back up a proposal that would restructure an important fee in most Utahns’ power bills and which, according to lawmakers, could help lower energy prices for Rocky Mountain customers.
This legislative session, which starts Tuesday, Richfield Republican Rep. Carl Albrecht is sponsoring a bill he stopped pursuing last year as negotiations swirled with the state’s largest energy provider over other issues. His proposal would hold Rocky Mountain Power responsible for 20% of costs to its Energy Balancing Account, which is fed by a market adjustment fee that can either credit or debit ratepayers for the utility’s costs not covered by the regular electricity rates.
With the 2026 bill, Albrecht hopes to reinstate a sharing band for Energy Balancing Account costs, with Utah customers taking care of 80% of it. Ratepayers have been covering the total cost since 2016, after the Legislature passed a law sponsored by Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, establishing the structure.

“The whole idea behind it is to give some rate relief to Utah customers,” Albrecht said on Tuesday, “and have Rocky Mountain Power have some skin in the game and have their shareholders face some of those costs.”
Utah lawmakers call on PacifiCorp to do some ‘soul searching’ about rates, working with Legislature

Albrecht would like to see Utah adopt a similar system to the other states Rocky Mountain Power serves. Idaho customers cover 90% of their Energy Balancing Account, while the company pays for the remaining 10%. In Wyoming, the shared cost structure is 80% for ratepayers and 20% for the utility. 
“We’re just asking that Utah has something similar, which protects the customers,” Albrecht said.
Albrecht initially introduced the idea to the Legislature in November 2024, during the interim session, following a 30.5% rate increase proposal from the company that rattled Republican state leaders. After the rate bump numbers became public, lawmakers grilled top Rocky Mountain Power executives, asking them to study a split from PacifiCorp — the utility’s parent company — and had the Energy Balancing Account under more legislative scrutiny.
In response to the bill draft, Rocky Mountain Power described the Energy Balancing Account in a statement to Utah News Dispatch as an “important tool for managing the variable costs of providing electric service,” and said that the Utah account is consistent with industry standards.
“This helps keep rates stable for customers while also contributing to the financial stability for the utility between general rate reviews,” the company said. “We will evaluate the proposed legislation with a view to achieve balanced outcomes that ensure fair prices for customers and a reasonable opportunity for the utility to recover the necessary costs to providing reliable energy for Utah’s families and businesses.”
But, with other negotiations taking place with Rocky Mountain Power executives, Albrecht’s bill was delayed in the Senate.
“Those negotiations were successful at the end of the session, so I dropped the bill and was asked to run it again this year,” he said.
The fee is designed to change according to market prices, which have been increasing for years, becoming a substantial part of ratepayers’ bills. 
Now that the Utah Public Service Commission has approved a 4.7% electricity residential rate increase — only about a quarter of the 18.1% that Rocky Mountain Power ended up requesting after public outcry — Energy Balancing Account fees may make up for those market costs. That’s if commissioners approve the charges.

Ron DeSantis’ popularity has dipped in the newest public opinion survey conducted by veteran polling firm Mason-Dixon.
The survey of 625 registered Florida voters shows the governor at 50% approval and 46% disapproval. That’s down from a Mason-Dixon survey taken last March, when he was at 53%, and the lowest ranking taken by Mason-Dixon since July 2020, when he was just at just 45%, following his opening up the state during the height of the COVID crisis.
The survey was conducted from Jan. 8 through Jan. 12. The margin for error was at +/- 4 percent.
Brad Coker, the Mason-Dixon pollster, pointed to “notable drops” among several voter groups from a 2025 survey. Among voters with no party affiliation, DeSantis approval rating has dropped 10 points, from 51% to 41%. He’s dropped with Hispanic voters as well, declining from 57% to 49%, and among black voters from 16% to 7%.
He is also now under water with women, with 49% disapproving and only 45% approving.
Coker says there are several reasons why the governor’s numbers might be dropping, including national trends for Republicans and voter fatigue as he begins his eighth and final year in office.
“With no immediate announced political plans, DeSantis’ popularity drop probably has no immediate impact,” Coker writes. “Overall, a 50% approval rating is not bad — it is simply somewhat lower than what he has enjoyed throughout his tenure.”

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Ahead of a launch in southern New Mexico this weekend, New Mexico Forward Party leaders announced this week the organization has gathered enough signatures to qualify as a minor party in the state.
Party organizers also announced two endorsements for Democratic candidates they characterized in a news release as “aligned” with the party’s mission.
One of those candidates, former Las Cruces Mayor Ken Miyagishima, who is running in the June 2, 2026 Democratic gubernatorial primary race, told Source NM the endorsement validates his “centrist credentials.”
“With this endorsement, it solidifies me with independents; they know I’m their guy,” Miyagishima said.
The other candidate, Matilda “Tilli” Villalobos, a former federal prosecutor running for state House District 37 in Las Cruces, could not be reached for comment.
The Forward Party says its values represent a return to civil politics with a focus on improving U.S. democracy. It was founded in 2022 by Andrew Yang after his unsuccessful Democratic bid for president in 2020, and former Republican New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman.
The party platform requires candidates to sign a pledge to follow the rule of law and the Constitution; use data-driven policy making; and to work collaboratively across parties. It also requires commitments to open primary elections, independent redistricting commissions and ranked-choice voting.
In an interview with Source, NM Forward Chairman and former state Rep. Bob Perls said a new state law enacted last year allowing unaffiliated voters to cast ballots in primary elections will mean an “improvement” for the quarter of New Mexicans not registered with the state’s major parties. Prior to the law, unaffiliated voters could utilize same-day registration to vote in one of the major parties’ primaries, but even that option had only been available for the last few years.
“We believe that the reason we have this hyper-partisanship and gridlock in Washington and most state capitals is due to little incentive for elected officials to coalition-build or compromise, and that’s largely because of the structure of closed primaries and partisan primaries,” Perls said.
In order to qualify as a minor party, state law requires more than 3,561 signatures from New Mexico voters — which is at least one-half of one percent of the total votes cast in the 2022 election, according to the secretary of state’s website.
Perls told Source NM the party has collected more than 4,500 signatures and plans to submit them for approval by state election officials in March or April.
“We want to elect, not just Forward Party candidates, but Democrats, Republicans and independents who reflect the values of wanting to work together, wanting to support these democracy reform measures, and wanting to stop the yelling and take down the temperature in political discourse,” Perls said.
Perls said Miyagishima and Villalobos embody those characteristics.
“We’re confident that even though they are Democrats, they are the kind of people who will work with Republicans, who will work with independents, and readily accept ideas outside of traditional Democratic ideas, if it’s going to serve their constituents,” he said.

Kay Ivey Tuesday called for expansions to a voucher-like school program and broader use of the death penalty in her State of the State address. 
In the Old House Chambers in the Alabama State Capitol, Ivey’s ninth and final State of the State was an election-year address that called significant spending increases, particularly pay raises for teachers and state employees, but was notably silent about addressing major cost increases in public employee insurance programs, a key issue for lawmakers in the 2026 session, which began Tuesday. 
“Our teachers are earning high marks. And we added 500,000 more credentialed men and women to our workforce,” Ivey said.

Ivey proposed a 2% pay raise for teachers in her fiscal year 2027 budget. In lieu of a pay raise for the FY 26 budget, the Legislature increased funding for health insurance and paid parental leave for public educators.
The Legislature will make the final decisions on spending in the state’s budgets.
“From day one, we put a hard focus on education. Now, I could not be prouder that my final Education Trust Fund proposal will be the largest ever in our state’s history,” Ivey said, though she did not say how big her proposal would be. The current ETF is $9.9 billion. 
Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, chair of the House Ways and Means Education Committee, said in an interview after Ivey’s speech that he was aware of Ivey’s proposals for pay raises for teachers and state employees and thinks they will make it into the final budget.
“I think we will. We’ve got lots to digest, and we haven’t seen the numbers yet,” Garrett said.
Ivey also asked lawmakers to expand the CHOOSE Act, which extends tax credits for use for private school tuition and other non-public education-related expenses, from $180 million to $250 million.
“That number will only grow as more folks learn about the program, as student athletes feel more confident in the rules and when it becomes fully universal in year three,” she said. “This will help even more families receive the education that best suits their child.”

The governor did not address rising health care costs in the Public Education Employee Health Insurance Program (PEEHIP) or the State Employees Health Insurance Program (SEHIP), which provide insurance to the state’s employees. 
Recent federal policy changes have added pressure to the state’s budgets. Both state health insurance plans, the Public Educator Employee’s Health Insurance Plan (PEEHIP) and the State Employee Insurance Board (SEIB), plan to request more money from the state to alleviate rising health costs.
PEEHIP’s request will impact the ETF, while SEIB’s request will impact the General Fund budget. PEEHIP plans to request a $380 million increase for fiscal year 2027.
Ivey touted the state’s improvements in education, a category where the state ranked 52nd in fourth grade math and 49th in fourth grade reading when Ivey took office in 2017. Now, she said, the state ranks 32nd in math and 34th in reading. 
House Minority Leader Rep. Anthony Daniels, D-Huntsville, said he appreciated Ivey’s recognition of the state’s improvement in math and reading, but wants to focus on science.
“We want to make certain that we double down our efforts on the science,” he said in an interview after Ivey’s speech. “That’s an area that is extremely critical to not just the defense of our nation, but the progress of our future, and so we want to make certain that we are focusing more attention on that.”
Ivey also supported a proposal from Rep. Matt Simpson, R-Daphne, and Sen. April Weaver, R-Alabaster, to expand the death penalty to those who rape or sodomize a child.
“I was proud to quickly offer my full and total support,” she said. “Ladies and gentlemen, I am urging you to pass this legislation so I can sign it into law.”
Simpson said in an interview after Ivey’s speech that the governor’s support means a lot to him. This proposal comes after seven people were arrested in Bibb County for their alleged involvement in a child sex trafficking ring. 
“I thought that was fantastic. She’s been strong on public safety,” Simpson said. “Once we filed this bill and had this opportunity to bring some public awareness to this, unfortunately, the situation in Bibb County has highlighted what this has done.”
The legislation is in part a direct challenge to a 2008 U.S. Supreme Court decision, known as Kennedy v. Louisiana, that declared the death penalty unconstitutional for crimes against individuals that do not result in the victim’s death. The court’s majority cited concerns that the prospect of the death penalty could encourage predators to kill victims, or expose victims to additional trauma through testimonies in the death penalty process. 
Simpson hopes that since other states have passed similar laws that his and Weaver’s version will be the final push to overturn the 2008 Supreme Court decision.
“We’re trying to show that this is not unusual. These are punishments that more people want to see, and I’m hopeful that we can overturn the Supreme Court decision,” he said.
One of Ivey’s top priorities in 2025 was the “Safe Alabama” package, a bundle of public safety legislation which mostly passed. For 2026, Ivey is supporting a smaller package of public safety bills including a 2% pay raise for all state employees, including state troopers.
“Whether it be our troopers’ efforts to make it safe, teachers’ steps to improve schools or our attempts to ensure healthcare options in our Capital City, I urge our local leaders to work with us over the next 12 months to put Montgomery on its strongest footing yet,” Ivey said.

Alabama House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, told members of the media that teachers and state employees deserve the raise and believes it will make it in the budgets.
“They deserve the pay raise, since the cost of living has gone up,” he said.
Senate Minority Leader Sen. Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, said a 2% raise is not enough. He said he is worried the raise would be offset by increased health costs, especially for teachers. 
“I wish they were higher, really,” he said in an interview. “We’re just going to have to work through that to make sure that that’s going to be a real 2% to both state and teachers employees.”
Ivey also celebrated the state’s $203 million first-year funding from the Rural Health Transformation Program, part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) passed by Congress in July. The money is meant to partially offset cuts to Medicaid in the coming years.
“We have laid the groundwork for success, and I urge you, our legislators, to help develop needed policy and to fully implement this program,” she said. “And to our healthcare leaders in the state: I challenge you to work with us in thinking outside-the-box and identifying new partners as we strive to improve health care in Alabama.”
The governor also proposed a flood notification system, inspired by floods in Texas in July that claimed the life of some young Alabama campers.
“Unfortunately, Alabama is no stranger to the wrath of Mother Nature. We are also home to many of our own camps. And y’all, as a former counselor myself, ensuring safety in these spaces is very personal to me,” she said. “We cannot put our young people at risk.”
Ivey also supports legislation from former Early Childhood Education Secretary Jeana Ross that would limit screen time for children under five years old. 
“Technology has incredible benefits, but too much of anything can be harmful,” Ivey said. “House Bill 78 will help our youngest Alabamians in their key developmental days.”
Ivey ended her reflective speech by thanking members of her cabinet, Legislative leadership and Alabamians.
“I am proud of Alabama. I am proud of our citizens. I am proud to continue leading our state forward. And I am humbled to be a governor of all the people.” she said. “This is our opportunity. So, let’s not waste a moment.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Kay-Ivey-Jan-13-2026-04-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-14 08:57:26.185466

Steven Horsford at a ""Fight Oligarchy"" rally in May, 2025. (Rosen image, Senate video screengrab; Horsford photo by Michael Lyle/Nevada Current)With President Donald Trump calling on Congress to ban corporate homeownership at the federal level, Nevada Congressional Democrats are pushing the administration to support existing legislation that monitors, but doesn’t cap, investor ownership of single family homes.  
U.S. Rep. Steven Horsford and U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen sponsored the Housing Oversight and Mitigation Exploitation (HOME) Act that seeks to enable federal agencies to investigate price-gouging practices by corporate investors and review anti-competitive practices in the residential housing market. 
The Nevada Democrats recently sent a letter to Trump urging his support for the bill. 
If passed, the U.S. Housing and Urban Development would be tasked with determining if corporate investors buy more than 5% of the single-family housing units in a market over a three-year period. 
Horsford and Rosen both said there were issues with placing a blanket cap or limit on investors at the federal level. 
“My bill intentionally relies on a percentage instead of a specific number limit before an investigation is triggered because housing markets vary widely,” Rosen said in a statement. “The impacts of buying up fifty homes in Las Vegas will be different than in Elko, which is why we can’t use a once-size-fits-all approach.”
Horsford’s office said since the number of large, out-of-state investors makes up a single digit percentage of single families housing stock “a nationwide cap will not prevent the problem.”  
“It could however incentivize institutional investors to make smaller-scale purchases, merging with other investors, or building homes for rent as a loophole,” the office said in a statement to Nevada Current. “That is why the HOME Act establishes monitoring and investigation triggers based on market concentration. The goal is to penalize bad actors while allowing responsible corporate owners to contribute to the housing supply by building new rental and affordable homes.”
Horsford’s office noted that he did support failed state legislation that sought to cap the number investors could buy in a single year. 
There have been several proposals in recent years at the federal level from Congressional Democrats that seek to limit corporate investors from purchasing single family homes. Those bills have lacked Republican support.
Trump posted on social media last week asking Congress to take action in an effort to tackle the housing and affordability crisis.
“I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it,” Trump wrote in a social media post last week. “People live in homes, not corporations.”
The post didn’t outline any legislative language. Trump indicated he would outline details of his proposal at the annual Davos Summit in Switzerland next week.
The announcement has resulted in some Republicans jumping on the bandwagon, even those who have been hostile to efforts to rein in the industry, said Sam Garin, the senior communications coordinator for the Private Equity Stakeholder Project.
Nevada Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, who has repeatedly stymied state legislative efforts to rein in corporate homeownership, announced he was “actively developing” a working group on the issue shortly after Trump’s post.  
In the letter Rosen and Horsford sent to Trump, they called on him to enact “meaningful oversight of the housing market, preventing large institutional investors from manipulating prices, and holding bad actor corporate property owners accountable for abusive practices that are increasing housing prices and putting the American Dream out of reach for millions of families.” 
The HOME Act is just one approach to addressing the housing crisis, Garin said. 
As the nation struggles to address the housing crisis, which include rising rents, limited affordable and available housing, and little tenant protections, there should be different policies adopted at both the federal and state level, she added. 
Both Congress and state legislatures need to look at many solutions from landlord registries to rent stabilization. 
“It’s the kind of thing where we need to come at it from a bunch of different angles to actually address it,” Garin said. “Obviously we support a cap and think it’s a really great idea. It doesn’t have to be a cap. What we could also see is changes to the tax code that reduce incentives for private equity firms or other institutional investors to be buying up these houses and profiting from them.”
While the HOME Act seeks to monitor institutional investors at the federal level, the bill also includes provisions that seek to limit investments from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to investors that have violated renter protections.  
“It’s especially notable that the HOME Act would limit investments from Fannie and Freddie to any organizations that have violated renter protections or have kind of engaged in exploitative rent hikes,” Garin said.
The problem to any meaningful policy solution is to ensure it has mechanisms of accountability built in legislation. 
“Any policy solution, any kind of policy intervention, needs to ensure that these firms and these big businesses do not get off with just a slap on the wrist or weak enforcement,” Garin said. “Very often, for these multi-billion dollar businesses, any kind of fines they get from the Federal Trade Commission just becomes a cost of doing business, and not a meaningful way of actually dissuading that behavior in the future.”
Garin also noted that Trump also has strong connections to the private equity industry as well as Wall Street, and if he wanted to rein in the industry he could use “those connections and work to actually get them to treat tenants better.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/rosenandhorsford-1024x615.jpg,,,2026-01-14 08:57:26.185466

Such an action could have far-reaching impacts across the U.S., potentially even in places that aren’t particularly friendly to noncitizens.
Two previous efforts by Trump to cut off some funding for sanctuary jurisdictions were shut down by courts.
Trump unveiled the concept this time late in a speech Tuesday at the Detroit Economic Club, without offering specifics.
“Starting Feb. 1, we’re not making any payments to sanctuary cities or states having sanctuary cities, because they do everything possible to protect criminals at the expense of American citizens and it breeds fraud and crime and all of the other problems that come,” he said. “So we’re not making any payment to anybody that supports sanctuary cities.”
Back in Washington, Trump was asked by reporters what kind of funding would be affected on Feb 1: “You’ll see,” he said. “It’ll be significant.”
There is no strict definition for sanctuary policies or sanctuary cities, but the terms generally describe limited cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Courts have rejected the idea before
In an executive orders last year, the president directed federal officials to withhold money from sanctuary jurisdictions that seek to shield people in the country illegally from deportation.
A California-based federal judge struck it down despite government lawyers saying it was too early to stop the plan when no action had been taken and no specific conditions had been laid out.
In Trump’s first term in office, in 2017, courts struck down his effort to cut funding to the cities.
Some of the details are tricky
The Justice Department last year published a list of three dozen states, cities and counties that it considers to be sanctuary jurisdictions.
The list is overwhelmingly made up of places where the governments are controlled by Democrats, including the states of California, Connecticut and New York, cities such as Boston and New York and counties including Baltimore County, Maryland, and Cook County, Illinois.
That list replaced an earlier, longer one that was met with pushback from officials who said it wasn’t clear why their jurisdictions were on it.
The administration has been threatening funding in specific places
The federal government has moved to halt funding for a variety of programs in recent weeks and is already facing legal challenges.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has warned states that have refused to provide data on recipients of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program money that they’ll be docked administrative funds. A court fight over the request for information was already under way before the threat came. Money hasn’t been stopped yet.
The U.S. Department of Health and Social Services said last week that it was halting money from five Democratic-led states for daycare subsidies and other aid to low-income families with children over unspecified suspicions about fraud. A court put that on hold
The administration has tried to use additional financial pressure against Minnesota, a state where it has also sent a wave of federal officers in an immigration crackdown. The Agriculture Department has said it’s freezing funding in the state — but without laying out many details.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services also told Minnesota last week that it intends to withhold $515 million every three months from 14 Medicaid programs that were deemed “high risk” after rejecting a corrective action plan it demanded because of fraud allegations. The amount is equivalent to one-fourth of the federal money for those programs. State officials said Tuesday that they’re appealing.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26013737139022-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-14 14:58:11.959867

(Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)The State of Nevada is now up to 40 lawsuits against the Trump administration, according to Attorney General Aaron Ford.
Ford, a Democrat, held a press conference Tuesday to highlight his office’s legal efforts against the Trump administration, whose actions he called “not only illegal and unconstitutional but entirely immoral.”
“It has seemed that every week the president attempted to circumvent the limitations of power that our country has placed on the office,” said Ford.
Democratic attorneys general across the country have filed dozens of lawsuits against the Trump administration during the first year of his second term. A case tracker maintained by the Progressive State Leaders Committee puts the number at 76 as of late Tuesday.
Nevada has signed onto 40 of those lawsuits so far.
In 25 of those 40 cases, courts have issued temporary or permanent injunctions on the alleged illegal policies. That includes a lawsuit first filed in April 2025 to block a Trump executive order on elections. Ford’s office is co-leading that lawsuit along with California and Massachusetts.
In addition to the 40 cases the state has formally joined, it has also filed numerous amicus curiae briefs in other cases challenging Trump actions.
Ford’s office is also defending the state in a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration in December over the state’s refusal to give sensitive voter information to the federal government.
Ford’s press conference comes as the U.S. Supreme Court resumes work after a winter recess. The court is expected to hear arguments or issue rulings soon on several high-profile issues, including tariffs, transgender athlete bans, and birthright citizenship.
A decision on a case challenging Trump’s tariff policies could come as early as Wednesday. A decision on birthright citizenship is expected this spring.
On day one of his second term, Trump issued an executive order that seeks to unilaterally abolish birthright citizenship. Democratic AGs and legal scholars argue it’s a clear violation of the 14th Amendment.
“People born in the United States are guaranteed citizenship,” Ford said Tuesday. “This has been the law of this land since the mid-1800s.”
“I’m confident we will prevail” in that case, added Ford.
Tuesday’s press conference had the feel of a campaign event for the gubernatorial race. Ford is running to be the Democratic challenger to Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo.
Answering a question about legal efforts related to immigration, Ford pointed to a Democratic AG’s lawsuit centered on federal Victims of Crime Act funds, which the Trump administration had attempted to withhold unless states participated in this immigration-enforcement efforts.
“I’m the leader in this state that said that it is not appropriate and it is unlawful,” said Ford. “Not the governor, and not others.”
Ford criticized Lombardo for saying in a March 2025 interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the numerous lawsuits Ford had filed against the Trump administration were “unfortunate.”
Ford said Tuesday that “every time the federal government oversteps, one of us is going to step up, and it’s not going to be” Lombardo.
The legal efforts against the Trump administration have come at no additional cost to the state, Ford emphasized, and the only costs have been normal litigation fees, such as court filing fees. No new staff have been added, as has happened in other states.
“More importantly,” Ford continued, “the cost to the state for not pursuing this litigation would have been astronomical.”
Many of the lawsuits by Democratic AGs have centered on returning withheld or frozen federal funding, including public education and food programs like the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FordPresser-1024x769.jpg,,,2026-01-14 07:57:18.297957

An agent in Houston put a teenage citizen into a chokehold, wrapping his arm around the boy’s neck, choking him so hard that his neck had red welts hours later. A black-masked agent in Los Angeles pressed his knee into a woman’s neck while she was handcuffed; she then appeared to pass out. An agent in Massachusetts jabbed his finger and thumb into the neck and arteries of a young father who refused to be separated from his wife and 1-year-old daughter. The man’s eyes rolled back in his head and he started convulsing.
After George Floyd’s murder by a police officer six years ago in Minneapolis — less than a mile from where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed Renee Good last week — police departments and federal agencies banned chokeholds and other moves that can restrict breathing or blood flow.
But those tactics are back, now at the hands of agents conducting President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign.
Examples are scattered across social media. ProPublica found more than 40 cases over the past year of immigration agents using these life-threatening maneuvers on immigrants, citizens and protesters. The agents are usually masked, their identities secret. The government won’t say if any of them have been punished.
In nearly 20 cases, agents appeared to use chokeholds and other neck restraints that the Department of Homeland Security prohibits “unless deadly force is authorized.”
About two dozen videos show officers kneeling on people’s necks or backs or keeping them face down on the ground while already handcuffed. Such tactics are not prohibited outright but are often discouraged, including by federal trainers, in part because using them for a prolonged time risks asphyxiation.
We reviewed footage with a panel of eight former police officers and law enforcement experts. They were appalled.
This is what bad policing looks like, they said. And it puts everyone at risk.
“I arrested dozens upon dozens of drug traffickers, human smugglers, child molesters — some of them will resist,” said Eric Balliet, who spent more than two decades working at Homeland Security Investigations and Border Patrol, including in the first Trump administration. “I don’t remember putting anybody in a chokehold. Period.”
“If this was one of my officers, he or she would be facing discipline,” said Gil Kerlikowske, a longtime police chief in Seattle who also served as Customs and Border Protection commissioner under President Barack Obama. “You have these guys running around in fatigues, with masks, with ‘Police’ on their uniform,” but they aren’t acting like professional police.
Over the past week, the conduct of agents has come under intense scrutiny after an ICE officer in Minneapolis killed Good, a mother of three. The next day, a Border Patrol agent in Portland, Oregon, shot a man and woman in a hospital parking lot.
Top administration officials rushed to defend the officers. Speaking about the agent who shot Good, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said, “This is an experienced officer who followed his training.”
Officials said the same thing to us after we showed them footage of officers using prohibited chokeholds. Federal agents have “followed their training to use the least amount of force necessary,” department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.
“Officers act heroically to enforce the law and protect American communities,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said.
Both DHS and the White House lauded the “utmost professionalism” of their agents.
Our compilation of incidents is far from complete. Just as the government does not count how often it detains citizens or smashes through vehicle windows during immigration arrests, it does not publicly track how many times agents have choked civilians or otherwise inhibited their breathing or blood flow. We gathered cases by searching legal filings, social media posts and local press reports in English and Spanish.
Given the lack of any count over time, it’s impossible to know for certain how agents’ current use of the banned and dangerous tactics compares with earlier periods.
But former immigration officials told us they rarely heard of such incidents during their long tenures. They also recalled little pushback when DHS formally banned chokeholds and other tactics in 2023; it was merely codifying the norm.
That norm has now been broken.
One of the citizens whom agents put in a chokehold was 16 years old. 
Tenth grader Arnoldo Bazan and his father were getting McDonald’s before school when their car was pulled over by unmarked vehicles. Masked immigration agents started banging on their windows. As Arnoldo’s undocumented father, Arnulfo Bazan Carrillo, drove off, the terrified teenager began filming on his phone. The video shows the agents repeatedly ramming the Bazans’ car during a slow chase through the city.
Bazan Carrillo eventually parked and ran into a restaurant supply store. When Arnoldo saw agents taking his father violently to the ground, Arnoldo went inside too, yelling at the agents to stop.
One agent put Arnoldo in a chokehold while another pressed a knee into his father’s neck. “I was going to school!” the boy pleaded. He said later that when he told the agent he was a citizen and a minor, the agent didn’t stop.
“I started screaming with everything I had, because I couldn’t even breathe,” Arnoldo told ProPublica, showing where the agent’s hands had closed around his throat. “I felt like I was going to pass out and die.”
DHS’ McLaughlin accused Arnoldo’s dad of ramming his car “into a federal law enforcement vehicle,” but he was never charged for that, and the videos we reviewed do not support this claim. Our examination of his criminal history — separate from any immigration violations — found only that Bazan Carrillo pleaded guilty a decade ago to misdemeanor driving while intoxicated.
McLaughlin also said the younger Bazan elbowed an officer in the face as he was detained, which the teen denies. She said that Arnoldo was taken into custody to confirm his identity and make sure he didn’t have any weapons. McLaughlin did not answer whether the agent’s conduct was justified.
Experts who reviewed video of the Bazans’ arrests could make no sense of the agents’ actions.
“Why are you in the middle of a store trying to grab somebody?” said Marc Brown, a former police officer turned instructor who taught ICE and Border Patrol officers at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers. “Your arm underneath the neck, like a choking motion? No! The knee on the neck? Absolutely not.”
DHS revamped its training curriculum after George Floyd’s murder to underscore those tactics were out of bounds, Brown said. “DHS specifically was very big on no choking,” he said. “We don’t teach that. They were, like, hardcore against it. They didn’t want to see anything with the word ‘choke.’”
After agents used another banned neck restraint — a carotid hold — a man started convulsing and passed out. 
In early November, ICE agents in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, stopped a young father, Carlos Sebastian Zapata Rivera, as he drove with his family. They had come for his undocumented wife, whom they targeted after she was charged with assault for allegedly stabbing a co-worker in the hand with scissors.
Body camera footage from the local police, obtained by ProPublica, captured much of what happened. The couple’s 1-year-old daughter began crying. Agents surrounded the car, looking in through open doors.
According to the footage, an agent told Zapata Rivera that if his wife wouldn’t come out, they would have to arrest him, too — and their daughter would be sent into the foster system. The agent recounted the conversation to a local cop: “Technically, I can arrest both of you,” he said. “If you no longer have a child, because the child is now in state custody, you’re both gonna be arrested. Do you want to give your child to the state?”
Zapata Rivera, who has a pending asylum claim, clung to his family. His wife kept saying she wouldn’t go anywhere without her daughter, whom she said was still breastfeeding. Zapata Rivera wouldn’t let go of either of them.
Federal agents seemed conflicted on how to proceed. “I refuse to have us videotaped throwing someone to the ground while they have a child in their hands,” one ICE agent told a police officer at the scene.
But after more than an hour, agents held down Zapata Rivera’s arms. One, who Zapata Rivera’s lawyer says wore a baseball cap reading “Ne Quis Effugiat” — Latin for “So That None Will Escape” — pressed his thumbs into the arteries on Zapata Rivera’s neck. The young man then appeared to pass out as bystanders screamed.
The technique is known as a carotid restraint. The two carotid arteries carry 70% of the brain’s blood flow; block them, and a person can quickly lose consciousness. The tactic can cause strokes, seizures, brain damage — and death.
“Even milliseconds or seconds of interrupted blood flow to the brain can have serious consequences,” Dr. Altaf Saadi, a neurologist and associate professor at Harvard Medical School, told us. Saadi said she couldn’t comment on specific cases, “but there is no amount of training or method of applying pressure on the neck that is foolproof in terms of avoiding neurologic damage.”
In a bystander video of Zapata Rivera’s arrest, his eyes roll back in his head and he suffers an apparent seizure, convulsing so violently that his daughter, seated in his lap, shakes with him.
“Carotid restraints are prohibited unless deadly force is authorized,” DHS’ use-of-force policy states. Deadly force is authorized only when an officer believes there’s an “imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury” and there is “no alternative.”
In a social media post after the incident and in its statement to ProPublica, DHS did not cite a deadly threat. Instead, it referenced the charges against Zapata Rivera’s wife and suggested he had only pretended to have a medical crisis while refusing help from paramedics. “Imagine FAKING a seizure to help a criminal escape justice,” the post said.
“These statements were lies,” Zapata Rivera alleges in an ongoing civil rights lawsuit he filed against the ICE agent who used the carotid restraint. His lawyer told ProPublica that Zapata Rivera was disoriented after regaining consciousness; the lawsuit says he was denied medical attention. (Representatives for Zapata Rivera declined our requests for an interview with him. His wife has been released on bond, and her assault case awaits trial.)
A police report and bodycam footage from Fitchburg officers at the scene, obtained via a public records request, back up Zapata Rivera’s account of being denied assistance. “He’s fine,” an agent told paramedics, according to footage. The police report says Zapata Rivera wanted medical attention but “agents continued without stopping.”
Saadi, the Harvard neurologist, said that as a general matter, determining whether someone had a seizure is “not something even neurologists can do accurately just by looking at it.”
DHS policy bars using chokeholds and carotid restraints just because someone is resisting arrest. Agents are doing it anyway. 
When DHS issued restrictions on chokeholds and carotid restraints, it stated that the moves “must not be used as a means to control non-compliant subjects or persons resisting arrest.” Deadly force “shall not be used solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing subject.”
But videos reviewed by ProPublica show that agents have been using these restraints to do just that.
In Los Angeles in June, masked officers from ICE, Border Patrol and other federal agencies pepper-sprayed and then tackled another citizen, Luis Hipolito. As Hipolito struggled to get away, one of the agents put him in a chokehold. Another pointed a Taser at bystanders filming.
Then Hipolito’s body began to convulse — a possible seizure. An onlooker warned the agents, “You gonna let him die.”
When officers make a mistake in the heat of the moment, said Danny Murphy, a former deputy commissioner of the Baltimore Police Department, they need to “correct it as quickly as possible.”
That didn’t happen in Hipolito’s case. The footage shows the immigration agent not only wrapping his arm around Hipolito’s neck as he takes him down but also sticking with the chokehold after Hipolito is pinned on the ground.
The agent’s actions are “dangerous and unreasonable,” Murphy said.
Asked about the case, McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, said that Hipolito was arrested for assaulting an ICE officer. Hipolito’s lawyers did not respond to ProPublica’s requests for comment.
According to the Los Angeles Times, Hipolito limped into court days after the incident. Another citizen who was with him the day of the incident was also charged, but her case was dropped. Hipolito pleaded not guilty and goes to trial in February.
Some of the conduct in the footage isn’t banned — but it’s discouraged and dangerous. 
A video from Los Angeles shows a Colombian-born TikTokker who often filmed ICE apparently passed out after officers pulled her from her Tesla and knelt on her neck. Another video shows a DoorDash driver in Portland, Oregon, screaming for air as four officers pin him face down in the street. “Aire, aire, aire,” he says. “No puedo respirar” — I can’t breathe. Then: “Estoy muriendo” — I’m dying. A third video, from Chicago, shows an agent straddling a citizen and repeatedly pressing his face into the asphalt. Onlookers yell that the man can’t breathe.
Placing a knee on a prone subject’s neck or weight on their back isn’t banned under DHS’ use-of-force policy, but it can be dangerous — and the longer it goes on, the higher the risk that the person won’t be able to breathe.
“You really don’t want to spend that amount of time just trying to get somebody handcuffed,” said Kerlikowske, the former CPB commissioner, of the video of the arrest in Portland.
Brown, the former federal instructor and now a lead police trainer at the University of South Carolina, echoed that. “Once you get them handcuffed, you get them up, get them out of there,” he said. “If they’re saying they can’t breathe, hurry up.”

Taking a person down to the ground and restraining them there can be an appropriate way to get them in handcuffs, said Seth Stoughton, a former police officer turned law professor who also works at the University of South Carolina. But officers have long known to make it quick. By the mid-1990s, the federal government was advising officers against keeping people prolongedly in a prone position.
When a federal agent kneeled on the neck of an intensive care nurse in August, she said she understood the danger she was in and tried to scream.
“I knew that the amount of pressure being placed on the back of my neck could definitely hurt me,” said Amanda Trebach, a citizen and activist who was arrested in Los Angeles while monitoring immigration agents. “I was having a hard time breathing because my chest was on the ground.”
McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, said Trebach impeded agents’ vehicles and struck them with her signs and fists.
Trebach denies this. She was released without any charges.
Protesters have also been choked and strangled. 
In the fall, a protester in Chicago refused to stand back after a federal agent told him to do so. Suddenly, the agent grabbed the man by the throat and slammed him to the ground.
“No, no!” one bystander exclaims. “He’s not doing anything!”
DHS’ McLaughlin did not respond to questions about the incident.
Along with two similar choking incidents at protests outside of ICE facilities, this is one of the few videos in which the run-up to the violence is clear. And the experts were aghast.
“Without anything I could see as even remotely a deadly force threat, he immediately goes for the throat,” said Ashley Heiberger, a retired police captain from Pennsylvania who frequently testifies in use-of-force cases. Balliet, the former immigration official, said the agent turned the scene into a “pissing contest” that was “explicitly out of control.”
“It’s so clearly excessive and ridiculous,” Murphy said. “That’s the kind of action which should get you fired.”
“How big a threat did you think he was?” Brown said, noting that the officer slung his rifle around his back before grabbing and body-slamming the protester. “You can’t go grab someone just because they say, ‘F the police.’”
Roving patrols + unplanned arrests = unsafe tactics. 
In November, Border Patrol agents rushed into the construction site of a future Panda Express in Charlotte, North Carolina, to check workers’ papers. When one man tried to run, an officer put him in a chokehold and later marched him out, bloodied, to a waiting SUV.
The Charlotte operation was one of Border Patrol’s many forays into American cities, as agents led by commander-at-large Gregory Bovino claimed to target “criminal illegal aliens” but frequently chased down landscapers, construction workers and U.S. citizens in roving patrols through predominantly immigrant or Latino communities.
Freelance photographer Ryan Murphy, who had been following Border Patrol’s convoys around Charlotte, documented the Panda Express arrest.
“Their tactics are less sophisticated than you would think,” he told ProPublica. “They sort of drive along the streets, and if they see somebody who looks to them like they could potentially be undocumented, they pull over.”
Experts told ProPublica that if officers are targeting a specific individual, they can minimize risks by deciding when, where and how to take them into custody. But when they don’t know their target in advance, chaos — and abuse — can follow.
“They are encountering people they don’t know anything about,” said Scott Shuchart, a former assistant director at ICE.
“The stuff that I’ve been seeing in the videos,” Kerlikowske said, “has been just ragtag, random.”
There may be other factors, too, our experts said, including quotas and a lack of consequences amid gutted oversight. With officers wearing masks, Shuchart said, “even if they punch grandma in the face, they won’t be identified.”
As they sweep into American cities, immigration officers are unconstrained — and, the experts said, unprepared. Even well-trained officers may not be trained for the environments where they now operate. Patrolling a little-populated border region takes one set of skills. Working in urban areas, where citizens — and protesters — abound, takes another.
DHS and Bovino did not respond to questions about their agents’ preparation or about the chokehold in Charlotte.
Experts may think there’s abuse. Holding officers to account? That’s another matter. 
Back in Houston, immigration officers dropped 16-year-old Arnoldo off at the doorstep of his family home a few hours after the arrest. His neck was bruised, and his new shirt was shredded. Videos taken by his older sisters show the soccer star struggling to speak through sobs.
Uncertain what exactly had happened to him, his sister Maria Bazan took him to Texas Children’s Hospital, where staff identified signs of the chokehold and moved him to the trauma unit. Hospital records show he was given morphine for pain and that doctors ordered a dozen CT scans and X-rays, including of his neck, spine and head.
From the hospital, Maria called the Houston Police Department and tried to file a report, the family said. After several unsuccessful attempts, she took Arnoldo to the department in person, where she says officers were skeptical of the account and their own ability to investigate federal agents.
Arnoldo had filmed much of the incident, but agents had taken his phone. He used Find My to locate the phone — at a vending machine for used electronics miles away, close to an ICE detention center. The footage, which ProPublica has reviewed, backed the family’s account of the chase.
The family says Houston police still haven’t interviewed them. A department spokesperson told ProPublica it was not investigating the case, referring questions to DHS. But the police have also not released bodycam footage and case files aside from a top sheet, citing an open investigation.
“We can’t do anything,” Maria said one officer told her. “What can HPD do to federal agents?”
Elsewhere in the country, some officials are trying to hold federal immigration officers to account.
In California, the state Legislature passed bills prohibiting immigration officers from wearing masks and requiring them to display identification during operations.
In Illinois, Gov. JB Pritzker signed a law that allows residents to sue any officer who violates state or federal constitutional rights. (The Trump administration quickly filed legal challenges against California and Illinois, claiming their new laws are unconstitutional.)
In Colorado, Durango’s police chief saw a recent video of an immigration officer using a chokehold on a protester and reported it to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, which announced it was looking into the incident.
In Minnesota, state and local leaders are collecting evidence in Renee Good’s killing even as the federal government cut the state out of its investigation.
Arnoldo is still waiting for Houston authorities to help him, still terrified that a masked agent will come first. Amid soccer practice and making up schoolwork he missed while recovering, he watches and rewatches the videos from that day. The car chase, the chokehold, his own screams at the officers to leave his dad alone. His father in the driver’s seat, calmly handing Arnoldo his wallet and phone while stopping mid-chase for red lights.
The Bazan family said agents threatened to charge Arnoldo if his dad didn’t agree to be deported. DHS spokesperson McLaughlin did not respond when asked about the alleged threat. Arnoldo’s dad is now in Mexico.
Asked why an officer choked Arnoldo, McLaughlin pointed to the boy’s alleged assault with his elbow, adding, “The federal law enforcement officer graciously chose not to press charges.”
How we did it



Nicole Foy is ProPublica’s Ancil Payne Fellow, reporting on immigration and labor. journalists Nicole Foy, McKenzie Funk, Joanna Shan, Haley Clark and Cengiz Yar gathered videos via Spanish and English social media posts, local press reports and court records. We then sent a selection of these videos to eight police experts and former immigration officials, along with as much information as we could gather about the lead-up to and context of each incident. The experts analyzed the videos with us, explaining when and how officers used dangerous tactics that appeared to go against their training or that have been banned under the Department of Homeland Security’s use-of-force policy.
We also tried to contact every person we could identify being choked or kneeled on. In some cases, we also reached out to bystanders.
Research reporter Mariam Elba conducted criminal record searches of every person we featured in this story. She also attempted to fact-check the allegations that DHS made about the civilians and their arrests. Our findings are not comprehensive because there is no universal criminal record database.
We also sent every video cited in this story to the White House, DHS, CBP, ICE, border czar Tom Homan and Border Patrol’s Gregory Bovino. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin provided a statement responding to some of the incidents we found but she did not explain why agents used banned tactics or whether any of the agents have been disciplined for doing so.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2251575611.jpg,,,2026-01-14 07:57:18.297957

Supporters say the state must combat a rise in crashes involving e-bikes.,"Gov. Phil Murphy should veto recently passed legislation regarding e-bikes, critics say, because it is confusing and targets low-income e-bike users. (Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)A controversial bill that would require people to obtain a driver’s license and insurance to operate an electric bike is on the governor’s desk, awaiting his signature or veto.
The legislation advanced out of both houses of the Legislature — by votes of 28-10 in the Senate and 53-10 in the Assembly — during a marathon voting session Monday.
Bill sponsor Senate President Nicholas Scutari introduced the legislation in November after a spate of fatal crashes around the state that involved e-bikes. Bill supporters said they had become alarmed at the number of young people they saw zipping around neighborhoods at high speeds on e-bikes.
Gov. Murphy touts accomplishments in final legislative address

Critics of the bill were successful in getting the bill amended, but they remain opposed. Corey Hannigan of the Tristate Transportation Campaign called the legislation confusing and said it would sharply curtail access to e-bikes for low- and moderate-income New Jerseyans.
“It’s difficult to support something that breaks away from every other state in the union and is the most punitive e-bike law in the country,” he said. “This is a huge administrative burden for the people who would most benefit from this transportation.”
Current law classifies electric bikes into three different categories, depending on how powerful and fast they are. Bikes that have a maximum speed of 28 miles per hour require licensing, registration, and insurance.
The bill would create new terms of “electric motorized bicycle,” which would include bikes with pedals and an electric motor capable of over 750 watts that can exceed 28 miles per hour, and “low-speed electric bicycle,” which would apply to bikes with an electric motor that provides assistance when the rider is pedaling and stops once the bike reaches 20 miles per hour. A “motorized bicycle” would be one equipped with a motor that provides assistance while pedaling or via a throttle.
Under the bill, e-bike users would be required to register a low-speed electric bicycle and have a driver’s license. Insurance would also be required for motorized bicycles and electric motorized bicycles.
It would also bar people from riding e-bikes from dusk to dawn without reflectors, and prohibit the sale of modification kits aimed at turning a low-speed e-bike into a motorized or electric motorized bicycle.
The bill would also restrict minors under 15 from operating an e-bike or motorized bike, and require those 17 and older to have a driver’s license. Anyone 15 or 16 would have to have a permit. There is an exemption if you rent the bike from a company that has a contract with a local government.
E-bike owners would have one year to meet the new licensing, registration, and insurance requirements. And people found to be violating these requirements could be fined up to $50.
The bill also includes a one-year ban on the sale of electric bikes online.
Nationally, e-bike injuries rose by 293% from 2019 to 2022, according to Columbia University researchers.

Gov. Phil Murphy, who has not indicated whether he would sign the bill, has until Jan. 20 to act on the legislation. That’s his last day in office.

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Ambitious electric service affordability legislation faced dozens of recommendations for improvement Tuesday — from lawmakers and lobbyists alike — across a two-hour hearing.
House Bill 1002, a House Republican priority proposal, would reshape utility providers’ low-income customer assistance programs, block service shut-offs to such customers on dangerously hot days, put all ratepayers on predictable billing plans and refashion ratemaking into three-year plans outfitted with performance-based incentives.
“The goal … is to prioritize affordability for Hoosier ratepayers and ensure our utilities are maintaining transparent, cost-effective practices,” the bill’s author, Rep. Alaina Shonkwiler, R-Noblesville, said in a statement after Tuesday’s committee meeting.
“Any potential changes to the bill will align with those goals,” she continued.
Only testimony was taken in in the House’s utilities committee on Tuesday, with amendments and a vote expected next week.

Advocates like Delaney Barber Kwon of Indiana Conservation Voters thanked Shonkwiler for her work but suggested “further clarification in order for intent to match implementation.”
The legislation would require electricity suppliers under Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission jurisdiction that don’t already offer low-income customer help programs to do so by July. The companies would fund those offerings to at least half the amount they recovered from ratepayers under their IURC-approved energy efficiency programs in the most recent year.
Luke Wilson, the chief policy officer of the Indiana Office of Energy Development, estimated that could direct up to $30 million annually to low-income Hoosier households.
“That is a cost shift that is already in bills,” he added, “so ratepayers are not feeling additional impact.”
The provision encountered mixed testimony.
Danielle McGrath, president of the Indiana Energy Association, said lawmakers shouldn’t use that funding mechanism because the revenue varies by utility and by year, while Kerwin Olson, executive director of Citizens Action Coalition, said it’s “more than adequate funding.”
Committee Chair Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, noted the money has to come from somewhere, lest the bill be caught up in the finance-focused Ways and Means Committee.
Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, and others pushed for greater regulator oversight of the program requirements instead of leaving it largely up to the utilities themselves.

The legislation would require providers to notify customers of assistance programs on their websites. Rep. Cherrish Pryor, D-Indianapolis, asked that the text also go directly on bills to better reach elderly ratepayers.
“My daughter is my parents’ IT support, so I appreciate your point,” Shonkwiler joked.
Another provision intended to ease the burden on low-income Hoosiers would mimic current policy banning winter electricity service shut-offs — from Dec. 1 to March 15 — to the summertime. A key difference, however, is the pause would be triggered by federal extreme heat warnings instead of taking effect across the hottest months of the year.
Pierce and customer advocates argued a months-based approach would be simpler to administer and benefit customers more.
“We need to be really careful (that) we just don’t pile up four months of debt on these people, and now they’re looking at trying to get reconnected, and the price is so high they can’t do it,” Soliday replied.
Debt fears also arose in detailed discussion over so-called budget billing plans, which promote predictability for customers by holding monthly bill amounts steady despite changes in usage. But when utilities settle up, shocked customers may find themselves on the hook for large sums.
“Families think they’re being on a program to help stabilize their finances, and they feel like they’re being preyed upon,” said Rep. Alex Burton, D-Evansville.
Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, speaks during an Indiana House committee meeting on Tuesday, Jan. 13. 2025. (Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Pryor suggested a name change.
“I think part of what’s confusing the people is they hear ‘budget billing,’ and they think … there is a savings,” she said. “So, maybe, the word ‘budget’ needs to be changed to something that’s more reflective of what it really is.”
“It is confusing,” Soliday agreed. “… It doesn’t save you money. It saves you from spikes, is what it does. And some folks can endure spikes, and (for) others, it’s really painful.”
House Bill 1002 would require that every customer be put on such plans, but be given the ability to opt out. Utilities would settle up with participants at least twice a year, in an effort to avoid the sticker shock of a once-annual true-up.
Several witnesses recommended removing “at least” from the legislation to ensure true-ups don’t occur so often they erode the predictability budget billing is supposed to bring. Other suggestions included limiting implementation to just low-income customers, adding more detail on when the debt is due and pushing the effective day back from July.
Bill explores longer rate cycles, incentives
The measure would also switch up Indiana’s traditional ratemaking process by requiring utilities to pursue IURC approval of multi-year rate plans. The first year would be done “in the same manner” as now, while the second and third years would be based on projections.
Although Soliday said the intent was to make utilities file the same detailed information as is currently required, some warned the language may not be explicit enough.
Joe Rompala, representing the Indiana Industrial Energy Consumers, also testified there’s no mechanism to settle the difference between the projected data and what actually transpires.
State explores multiyear rate setting, performance incentives for utilities

“This helps ensure that customers are only paying for assets which have actually been put into service, and which are actually being used to serve them when rates go into effect,” Rompala said. “This upholds a longstanding legal principle which helps shield ratepayers from excessive investment, which generates no direct benefits to them.”
Pierce and several witnesses objected to language specifying that the multi-year rate plans operate “independently” of trackers — requiring that regulators consider them “separately.”
Trackers allow utilities to increase rates based on certain expenses they have.
Sam Carpenter, the executive director of the Hoosier Environmental Council, feared that could “undermine some of the cost-containment goals.” He asked for lawmakers to clarify the “interaction” between those mechanisms.
Soliday previously said some trackers may “disappear” if multi-year ratemaking is adopted, telling the committee, “I’ve had some (utilities) say to me, they may just drop (the Transmission, Distribution, Storage Improvement Charge) completely, because it works into the plan.”
The multi-year rate plans would be paired with new performance metrics and incentives tied to customer affordability and service restoration.
Several witnesses suggested incentivizing additional priorities, like reducing peak load demand or promoting environmental sustainability. Others asked that the incentives be tailored to specific utilities or said the proposed incentive range is too small to drive utility decision-making.
It’s unclear which chunks of the bill could get the biggest revisions.
“I appreciate everyone who testified in the committee today and expect any amendments put forth to reflect the valuable insights and feedback we continue to receive from experts, stakeholders and residential ratepayers,” Shonkwiler said.

(Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer)As U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement continues to unleash raids in Minneapolis, our police officers face the same struggle as in other target cities — including our sister city of St. Paul — to keep people safe without assisting in those raids.  
After several months of study and public input following questions raised about Minneapolis police’s crowd control tactics during the overly militarized Lake Street raid in June, the city amended the separation ordinance to strengthen and clarify this issue. In addition, MPD has used its own settlement agreement process with the state Department of Human Rights to gather its own public input, and released a revised immigration policy that both more clearly prohibits assisting ICE and provides more protection to the public.    
One can make the case that this wouldn’t have happened without strong and sustained public pressure, but the bottom line is that it did happen.
MPD Chief Brian O’Hara described the new policies at a press conference just days after the Trump administration announced “Operation Metro Surge,” which continues to seize members of both our Somali and Hispanic communities and create chaos. The new policy restates the current general rule that MPD will “not participate in immigration enforcement,” and goes further to say that MPD also shall “not assist in the removal or transportation of people”; “not provide crowd management solely at the request of immigration enforcement agencies”; and, absent “a clear an immediate threat to life, serious injury, or destruction of property…will not escort federal immigration agents to enforcement locations or close streets when there are no traffic or public safety issues.”  
Finally, the new policy specifically affirms that gathering a crowd to protest is a “First Amendment-protected event”; that MPD will record and report any federal violations of this right; and that MPD “will verbally or physically intervene” against any federal use of excessive force as soon as there is “a reasonable and safe opportunity to do so.”  
During his press conference, O’Hara made clear that this incudes responding to 911 calls from terrified residents. Indeed, he told the New York Times this week that his agency has seen a marked increase in 911 calls responding to the newly volatile situation. 
Of course, MPD cannot and must not launch an armed attack against federal officers, but they have made clear that their foremost duty is to “protect and serve” our community, not invasive federal agents. And, that they will do as much as the law allows to hold federal officers accountable if they cross the line.  
As O’Hara pointed out, the new policies and training will “remind our officers of their duty to intervene.”  
The dilemma that our community faces is that MPD’s recent commitment to the law and Constitution — refraining from escorting ICE agents or providing ICE crowd control, while upholding First Amendment rights by declining to  dispatch officers to ICE protests absent a “clear and immediate threat” — means that MPD may not be present to intervene when ICE attacks protesters suddenly and without any forewarning or provocation. 
That’s what happened when an ICE agent killed Renee Nicole Good.  
Even in the face of this dilemma, however, MPD has continued to honor its reinforced commitment to constitutional policing during the massive protests following the killing. It is clear that O’Hara will not allow ICE provocations to divert MPD from this commitment.
This is a good example of the kind of transformation that citizens demanded after the police murder of George Floyd, and which was codified by the settlement agreement with the Department of Human Rights.  
Even in the face of the current chaos and distress, we should all be encouraged by this strong step by our local law enforcement in the right direction.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Assembly, which met for its first floor session of the year on Tuesday, passed two constitutional amendments that could be on ballots in November as well as bills to withhold pay from suspended judges and to make “grooming” to establish a sexual relationship with a child a felony crime.
For the first time in nearly two decades, the floor session occurred without livestream coverage from WisconsinEye, the nonprofit organization that produces live and archived videos of state government similar to C-Span.
Two constitutional amendments advance
The Assembly passed two constitutional amendment proposals. One would bar the closure of places of worship during a state of emergency and the other would  eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs throughout Wisconsin. 
Each proposed amendment is up for the second of two required votes in consecutive sessions of  the Legislature. If they pass the Senate, they will appear on voters’ ballots in November. A majority of voters must approve them before the state constitution can be amended.
AJR 10, which would prohibit the state from ordering the closure of places of worship during a state of emergency, passed 56-43. Rep. Sylvia Ortiz-Velez (D-Milwaukee) joined Republicans in favor of the proposal.
The proposal was first introduced during the 2023-25 session in response to actions taken by the Evers administration during the COVID-19 pandemic. A “Safer at Home” order issued by Evers in March 2020 designated religious entities as essential but said gatherings should include fewer than 10 people in a room at a time and said people needed to adhere to social distancing requirements as much as possible. The order also advised places of worship to have drive-in services.
Only Rep. Ron Tusler, the proposal’s author, spoke about it during the floor session. 
“No more than 10 people at a time, no matter how big the church structure was. What part of never infringe the right of every person to worship almighty God, according to the dictates of their conscience, did Gov. Evers not understand?” Tusler asked, referring to the Wisconsin State Constitution. “Evers was wrong to limit our churches to 10.”
Voters would be asked “Shall Section 18 of Article I of the Constitution, which deals with religious liberty, be amended to prohibit the state or a political subdivision of the state from ordering the closure of, or forbidding gatherings in, places of worship in response to a state of emergency, including a public health emergency?”
AJR 102, which seeks to target diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in state and local governments, passed 54-45 with only Republican support. 
Rep. Dave Murphy (R-Hortonville) said the proposal will restore “merit, fairness and equality to government practices from the state Capitol, all the way down to our school boards and everything in between” including when it comes to hiring, scholarships and contracting.
Rep. Supreme Moore Omokunde (D-Milwaukee), speaking against the proposal, said it represents an opportunity for Republicans “to rev up voters for November and an opportunity to give red meat to the base.” 
Voters across the state could find the constitutional amendment proposals alongside a slate of high stakes races on their ballots in November including a race for governor, congressional races and races for the state Senate and Assembly that will determine control of the chambers in 2027. 
Rep. Margaret Arney (D-Wauwatosa) said the anti-DEI proposal creates a roadblock to helping her community.
“We need to do more to have Black and brown kids succeed in Wisconsin,” Arney said. “This change doesn’t help improve well-being in the district. It gets in the way.”
“This is the kind of fairness that the people of Wisconsin are looking for,” Murphy responded.
The proposal now needs to pass the Senate before it can go to voters. If it passes there, voters will see the following question on their ballots in November: “Shall section 27 of article I of the constitution be created to prohibit governmental entities in the state from discriminating against, or granting preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in public employment, public education, public contracting, or public administration?”
Withholding judge’s pay during temporary suspension
AB 380 would require that if the state Supreme Court temporarily suspends a judge from practicing in the state  pending final determination of proceedings or imposes a suspension as a disciplinary sanction in a case of misconduct then the suspension must be without pay.
The bill passed 57-42. Rep. Jenna Jacobson (D-Oregon), Rep. Steve Doyle (D-Onalaska) and Rep. Tara Johnson (D-Town of Shelby) joined Republicans in support of the bill.
The bill was introduced last year after the arrest and suspension of former Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan, who has since been found guilty of felony obstruction of federal immigration agents in December and submitted her resignation from her position in January.
Bill coauthor Rep. Shae Sortwell (R-Two Rivers) told reporters before the session that the bill will ensure that “when a judge is suspended for misconduct, they are not being continued to be paid by the people of Wisconsin.”
“Not only is it an extended vacation, which is what Judge Dugan ended up enjoying while she was not doing her job, but in addition to that, we had to have other judges fill the role and get the job done so that cases could continue to be adjudicated in Milwaukee County,” he added. “If another judge decides to do this, they shouldn’t be able to collect their pay, hundreds of thousands of dollars, while that case is pending.” 
Sortwell also said an amendment to the bill will ensure that should a judge be found not guilty  they would receive backpay. 
During floor debate, Rep. Andrew Hysell (D-Sun Prairie) called it a messaging bill given that it wouldn’t have applied to Dugan. He pointed out that the statute that the bill would change was not used by the state Supreme Court when it suspended Dugan. 
“It would have saved taxpayers zero dollars,” Hysell said. “I understand that certain bills are meant to convey certain messages to the public, but even a messaging bill should have some arguable connection to the underlying problem that it supposedly fixes.” 
Sortwell said that Hysell was right it wouldn’t have affected Dugan, but reiterated that his bill is looking towards the future.
“We do believe in innocence until proven guilty,” Sortwell said. “She was found to be guilty and good riddance to her.”
Grooming a crime
The Assembly also passed AB 677, which would make grooming a felony crime in Wisconsin, in a 93-6 vote. Reps. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee), Angelina Cruz (D-Racine), Francesca Hong (D-Madison), Christian Phelps (D-Eau Claire) and Angelito Tenorio (D-West Allis) voted against the proposal.
Bill author Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) said the bill will help protect children and noted that she started working on the bill about 18 months ago due to the case of Christian Enwright, a former Kenosha teacher who pleaded guilty last year to over a dozen misdemeanor counts of disorderly conduct after he had an inappropriate relationship with a 14-year-old student.
“Anyone who followed that case and saw the messages that Enright sent would know that his behavior is far more than disorderly. Because of the lack of a criminal definition of grooming, that was all he could be charged with,” Nedweski said. 
Under the bill, grooming in Wisconsin would be defined as “a course of conduct, pattern of behavior, or series of acts with the intention to condition, seduce, solicit, lure, or entice a child for the purpose of producing distributing or possessing depictions of the child engaged in sexually explicit conduct.”  
A person convicted of a grooming charge, under the bill, would be guilty of a Class G felony. The charge would increase to a Class F felony if the person is in a position of trust or authority, and to a Class E felony if the child has a disability and to a Class D felony if the violation involves two or more children. A convicted person would need to register as a sex offender.
An amendment to the bill would change the crime to a Class I felony if the person convicted of the crime is a school staff member or volunteer. 
“This is not about vague feelings or misunderstandings. There needs to be a pattern of predatory behavior with the intent to have sexual contact with the victim,” Nedweski said. “This bill came as a result of months of conversations with law enforcement prosecutors, district attorneys, educators and victim advocates.”
Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) said in a statement that she appreciated the bipartisan effort on the bill.
“We all share a commitment to protecting kids in school and ensuring they can safely learn and grow,” Neubauer said. “This is a critical issue, and I hope we will continue working together to support and protect our kids.”
Assembly’s first time on the floor without WisconsinEye livestream
Ahead of the Assembly floor session, Neubauer called the absence of WisconsinEye as lawmakers continue their business this month an “unsustainable situation.” The nonprofit organization ceased coverage and pulled its archive offline on Dec. 15 due to financial difficulties.
“It is not a good day for accountability to the people who elected us to serve them,” Neubauer said. “Transparency is an essential part of a functioning democracy. Without it, mistrust thrives and multiplies at a time when we need to be building trust in state government. We need to be demonstrating that government can and must be a force for good. This is a step in the wrong direction, and it erodes the public’s trust in this institution.” 
Neubauer said she is open to negotiating with her Republican colleagues to find a solution. She said that lawmakers did not set the organization up for success with the match requirements placed on the $10 million that the state set aside for an endowment. 
“Not sure that a $10 million requirement was ever really realistic for WisconsinEye. We would of course like to see more fundraising,” Neubauer said.
Neubauer and Democrats also questioned why Republican lawmakers were not working more quickly towards a solution as well as why they began enforcing a ban against members of the public who try to record committee proceedings.
“I would ask that you ask yourself what kind of politician doesn’t want for a camera to film what we are doing. What kind of intentions does that politician have? What kind of motivations do they have? What do they have to hide? Why are they doing that?” Rep. Mike Bare (D-Verona) told reporters. “We’re doing important work. People ought to be able to see what we’re doing.”
Gov. Tony Evers told reporters on Monday that he is open to exploring options for getting WisconsinEye back online, but isn’t supportive of just giving the nonprofit state funds without a match requirement.
“I think there has to be some skin in the game,” Evers said of WisEye. 
Republican leaders have also said that they support improving transparency but expressed some concerns about  giving the organization state funds. 
In November, before WisconsinEye went dark, the organization’s president Jon Henkes told the Examiner that the board hadn’t raised any money. He said then that the organization had been reaching out to potential donors about providing large-sum contributions 
“We’re not asking for $5,000 gifts right now. We’re asking for gifts in the $50,000 [to] $500,000 range and that’s a limited amount of people out there,” Henkes said in November.
The organization started seeing more small-dollar donations in December. 
“Small gift fundraising… through online and small checks that have been arriving in the mail are helpful. They don’t get us where we need to be, but it’s a statement that it’s not just the lobbyists and elected officials around the state in the news media who are supporting us there,” Henkes said in December. “There are a lot of people who are citizen viewers who recognize the value of WisconsinEye and are taking the time to go online to make a small gift or send a check, and we’re very grateful for that. That’s a huge encouragement to us.”
WisconsinEye has increased its attempts to raise money from small-sum donations, including by launching a GoFundMe campaign on Monday. As of Tuesday, the campaign had raised more than $8,000 from over 100 donations. The goal is $250,000, which would help support three months of the organization’s operational costs.

(Photo by Tom Davies/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana legislators aren’t going along with all the federal tax cuts that President Donald Trump pushed through Congress last summer.
A hefty tax break for businesses included in what Republicans dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” won’t be applied to state taxes under legislation advancing in the state Senate.
Republican fiscal leaders, however, haven’t said which of the dozens of other new federal tax cuts — including the temporary deductions for workers who receive tips and overtime wages — will be extended to state taxes.
An analysis from Gov. Mike Braun’s administration estimated that total state tax breaks on businesses and individuals could top $900 million over the next two years if the Legislature were to fully conform the state tax code with the federal changes.

The Senate Tax and Fiscal Committee last week endorsed Senate Bill 212 adopting a few of the federal tax breaks.
Committee Chair Sen. Travis Holdman, however, specified that the bill would not include a federal tax cut on some production property because of its cost.
“It’s just got a hefty price tag. It was $60-some million the first year, and it grew to like $300 million over four or five years,” Holdman, R-Markle, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “So it’s just just too hefty for us to do that.”
Sam Charron, a vice president of the Indiana Manufacturers Association, argued for adoption of that tax break, saying it “incentivizes manufacturers to increase their production capacity in the U.S. and, therefore, here in the state of Indiana.”
Uncertainty on other tax breaks
Holdman said his committee would take up a separate bill next week addressing whether to conform state tax law with 37 other provisions in the federal legislation.
He said the first bill focused on federal tax changes that would take effect for the 2025 tax year, with the aim of getting that bill to Braun’s desk by the end of January. It is set for a full Senate vote on Thursday.
Holdman hasn’t specified what will be adopted from the longer list, which includes the temporary federal deductions for workers who receive tips and overtime wages along with the interest on loans for vehicles built in the U.S. 
The state analysis projects that taxpayers would save nearly $275 million over the next two years with the deduction for overtime wages. 
The tax break on tips would total about $80 million during that time, while the vehicle loan deduction was estimated at $70 million. 
The state tax code generally conforms with federal law for the simplicity of determining taxable income. 
Indiana’s last major conformity update came in 2023, when Indiana adopted the Internal Revenue Code as of Jan. 1, 2023, bringing the state into line with pandemic-era relief measures such as the CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan. 
Whatever tax measures the state Senate endorses will then go to the Indiana House for its consideration.
House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jeff Thompson, the chamber’s leader on tax matters, said he was in “ongoing discussions” on provisions such as the exemptions for overtime and tips income.
“I’ll look at everything, all our options, kind of see when the time comes,” Thompson, R-Lizton, said this week. “I’m not thinking much about it until it gets here.”

Three men face felony animal cruelty charges in Uinta County for allegedly roping and riding a moose. The case is resurfacing questions about wildlife abuse in Wyoming.
The post Moose torture case puts Wyoming back in unsavory spotlight appeared first on WyoFile .","This story was originally published by Mountain Journal.
Wyoming is back in the spotlight for another alleged case of wildlife abuse, this time in the southwest part of the state.
In Uinta County, three men face felony charges after allegedly roping, riding and dragging a moose across the ground on a ranch in 2021. 
The Uinta County Herald first reported that Range Martin, Justin Martin and Kylan Platt allegedly rode, spurred and roped a cow moose. The trio was also charged with “wanton taking of a big game animal,” which suggests the moose died from its injuries. According to court documents, videos showed that the moose appeared to be blind in one eye and in poor health. A call requesting comment from Justin Martin was returned, but the caller hung up without offering comment.
On social media, the news spurred outrage from Wyomingites and out-of-staters alike. It echoes the western Wyoming case of Cody Roberts, who allegedly ran down a wolf with his snowmobile in February 2024. Still alive, the wolf’s mouth was duct taped and it was paraded around a bar in Daniel before it was reportedly taken outside and killed. Roberts recently pleaded not guilty to felony animal cruelty and his case is slated for trial in Sublette County in March. 
The Roberts wolf incident was notable not only for the actions of the accused, but also for the initial punishment: a $250 fine for possession of live wildlife. Roberts allegedly ran down the wolf in the state’s “predator zone,” which refers to the roughly 85% of Wyoming where it is legal to take predatory animals, such as wolves, without a license. The Sublette County Attorney’s Office eventually summoned a grand jury, which resulted in an indictment.
Backlash was swift and fierce as wildlife advocates traveled from far-flung locales to Wyoming to voice frustration. In a state where so many tourism dollars rely on its abundant wildlife, the Wyoming Office of Tourism’s social media accounts also went dark as users commented missives such as #BoycottWyoming. It’s unclear whether the state saw a discernible financial impact in 2024 — the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis has not yet published its annual report on the outdoor recreation industry for that year. 
“This is not the Wyoming way, not the cowboy way. It’s simply sick. The stewardship of our wildlife is something we cannot take lightly.”Paul Ulrich, president, Wyoming Sportsmanship
Wyoming Sportsmanship, a grassroots organization established in response to the Sublette County wolf incident, issued a statement about the moose-abuse case, calling for the Uinta County prosecutor’s office to pursue the harshest penalties allowed under the law to deter future crimes against Wyoming’s wildlife.
“[The case is] pathetic and disgusting behavior and clearly poor excuses for cowboys,” Paul Ulrich, president of Wyoming Sportsmanship and a fourth-generation Wyomingite based in Pinedale, said in a press release. “I am certain that our ranching community shares in my condemnation of this behavior and call for full force of the law in prosecution and sentencing. This is not the Wyoming way, not the cowboy way. It’s simply sick. The stewardship of our wildlife is something we cannot take lightly.”
Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a national organization aiming to reform states’ wildlife management to focus on protecting wildlife and ecosystems, said in an interview that these cases are part of a system that promotes “a culture of cruelty.” While Wyoming has had some egregious examples, including an Albany County man facing felony charges for allegedly killing a wild horse with a four-wheeler, there are heinous crimes against animals everywhere, she said.
Jess Johnson, government affairs director for the Wyoming Wildlife Federation, an organization focused on conservation and sportsmen advocacy, said that when she first heard of the moose incident, she thought, “not again.”
“The fact that we have to keep standing up, saying, ‘This is grotesque,’ I think everybody here is frustrated by that,” she said.
Johnson and others working in wildlife advocacy are considering whether more crimes are committed against wildlife in Wyoming now than in the past, or if, because of social media and the spotlight of the Roberts case, the public is just hearing about it more. While it’s difficult to quantify, Johnson said the increased scrutiny comes with a silver lining.
“It’s good that we’re catching them,” she said. “The fact that it’s made it out and that it’s being prosecuted: That’s a good thing. This could have just flown under the radar forever and nobody would have known about it. And it’s probably happened everywhere, in every state in this country … You can’t fix things if you don’t shine a light on them.”
A critical bill passes
In 2025, the Wyoming Legislature passed House Bill 275, which increased penalties for knowingly torturing, tormenting or mutilating living wildlife. It’s now a misdemeanor for a first offense and a felony for a second offense.
Most wildlife advocates wish the bill had gone a step further to ban vehicle-based animal harassment on public lands. 
Kristin Combs, executive director of Wyoming Wildlife Advocates, said that if Wyoming wants to portray itself as a state that cares about its wildlife, it should pass legislation that bans using a vehicle to kill predators. Outlawing vehicular killing is the No. 1 priority for Combs’ nonprofit wildlife advocacy group going into the legislative session next month, she said. Since 2026 is a Wyoming budget session, legislation needs a two-thirds majority vote to be introduced to the full body, which can be a high bar to clear.
“Some lawmakers are really aware of the fact that Wyoming continues to have these really egregious stories coming out and that we want to show the world and the rest of the country that we do care about wildlife and we’re going to take the steps necessary to protect our wildlife here,” Combs said. “It’s such a big part of our tourism and our economy, there’s no reason not to.”

Jim Magagna was part of the Treatment of Predators Working Group that developed the legislation that would eventually be House Bill 275, alongside Johnson, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department, the Wyoming Department of Agriculture, and Wyoming lawmakers.
“We were comfortable with that,” said Magagna, who also serves as executive vice president of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association. “We felt it was appropriate. We don’t condone any abuse of animals.”
In the case of the moose, headlines referred to the accused as “cowboys,” a moniker Magagna feels is misplaced. 
“It’s not cowboys doing this,” he said. “Ranchers and cowboys normally don’t do things like this.” 
Still, Magagna noted that he spoke with ranchers in Uinta County claiming the men charged with abusing the moose are known as helpful to their neighbors and overall pleasant to work with. He takes issue with those who criticize ranchers writ large — or any group of people for the actions of individuals — for a specific incident.
“We lump these people into categories,” he said. “And I certainly condemn what they did, but I don’t think that speaks for all the cattle industry or the cowboys who are out there. Ninety-eight percent of them, 98% of the time, are out there managing wildlife in a way that provides habitat for managing cattle in the way that provides habitat for wildlife.”
Predators versus game
Where the agriculture industry often differs from wildlife advocates is in its stance on predator management. While Magagna says he supports legislation that punishes animal cruelty, the provision that would have outlawed using snowmobiles and other vehicles to kill predators was a bridge too far for stockgrowers. As the law was written, he says, someone who runs over a predator with a snowmobile is obligated to stop and kill that predator. Alternatively, he adds, shooting at a wolf or coyote and failing to kill it could be worse than killing it immediately with a snowmobile.
“That animal may spend days suffering far more than it would have suffered if I had hit it with the snow machine and killed it right away,” he said.
Combs, with the wildlife advocates group, says protecting livestock is a common goal for both ranchers and wildlife interests. She cited nonlethal management methods as a more ethical way to more permanently curb predation. 
“Another big focus of our organization is to really help ranchers and livestock producers implement these things, have funds for them and teach people how to use them so we’re not just recycling conflict,” she said, “we’re taking care of the problem.”
Magagna doesn’t think it’s so simple. He says stockgrowers use an array of tools, such as guard dogs in sheep operations or county predator boards that employ trappers to professionally remove predators. 
“I don’t see any of these things as being an either/or,” he said. “It’s what’s the appropriate combination of lethal tools and nonlethal tools?”
“Policy is shaping behavior and culture is following, but it goes both ways. When laws treat certain animals as disposable, some people internalize that message.”Michelle Lute, executive director, Wildlife for All
Lute with Wildlife for All says different outcomes of the moose and wolf cases show a double standard when it comes to wildlife. As an example of effective state policy, she lauded a bill passed in the New Mexico Legislature in early 2025 that, in part, changed the name of the state’s Department of Fish and Game to the Department of Wildlife, which, she says, reflects better management of wildlife for its own sake rather than for its value to sportsmen.
“It’s horrible what happened to this moose,” Lute said. “At least, though, it’s being taken seriously and prosecuted, but it really shows the double standards that we have for these prey species that folks value in an economic sense because they want to hunt these animals. But we don’t see the same seriousness taken when it’s a wolf, a racoon or a skunk. There’s all these other carnivores that don’t necessarily have the attention like certain game species.”
For Johnson, there is still policy work to be done, but she says effective legislation that can meaningfully prosecute wildlife offenders takes time. 
“I know people were extremely frustrated with Wyoming and not addressing everything they all wanted in that bill. But I still think it’s coming,” Johnson said. “There are people that are trying to do this right, because legislation is not passed easily, and it shouldn’t be. I would hope that what comes from this incident is a recognition of the work that our wildlife officers are doing, and a willingness to fund [Wyoming Game and Fish] to the point where they can hire more people to do work like that.”
Lute described wildlife treatment and management as a “two-way arrow.”
“Culture follows policy and vice versa,” she said. “Policy is shaping behavior and culture is following, but it goes both ways. When laws treat certain animals as disposable, some people internalize that message.”
Policy aside, Johnson says people need to be quicker to call out bad behavior and better about connecting with nature. 
Combs, citing research from the National Link Coalition, which investigates ties in animal abuse and human mental health, said that the behavior of those accused in the moose-abuse case is a result of the state’s struggles with its mental health system, which are driven by a “cowboy-up” mentality and a lack of access to services.
Combs and Johnson agree that the majority of Wyomingites stand against animal torture. That hunters, for example, are conscientious of that in taking their shots. Still, Combs says, there is a segment of the population that sees animals as beings over which humans have dominion.
“By holding up these examples of really egregious things that are happening and saying, ‘This is not who we are as a people in Wyoming, and this is not how we treat any animal here,’” Combs said, “I think that’s the message that we want to send to the world.”

As part of the governor’s recommendation for $22 million in extra Medicaid cuts, he says the state could remove Medicaid dental coverage for adults, and home and community-based services, which are meant to help people with developmental disabilities live outside of institutional settings. 
The governor’s budget chief, Lori Wolff, told the Idaho Legislature’s budget committee on Tuesday that following through on many of Little’s cut ideas would require a bill changing state policy.

“These decisions are difficult,” Wolff told the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC. “And we are going to have to work closely together to decide how we do this.”
JFAC’s new co-chair, Rep. Josh Tanner, an Eagle Republican, seemed skeptical of the governor’s budget proposal. 
“Medicaid growth is crowding out every other priority,” Tanner wrote in a statement. “Instead of presenting real reforms, the Governor leaves behind a Medicaid budget hole based on unspecified cuts, shifting the toughest decisions to the Legislature.”

 Idaho eyes Medicaid cuts after state tax cuts, and recent federal and state Medicaid cuts

Idaho is facing multimillion projected budget shortfalls — about $40 million this fiscal year, and more than $500 million next fiscal year — after years of state tax cuts. State officials are returning to talks of cutting Medicaid after passing a massive Medicaid cost-cutting bill last year, and after President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” this summer deeply cut federal funds for Medicaid. 
Years after the Legislature cut adult dental Medicaid coverage after the Great Recession, state lawmakers restored the benefit as projections showed dental coverage actually saved the state money. After the federal “big beautiful bill” cut Medicaid this year, some Idahoans feared that optional Medicaid benefits like home and community-based services could face cuts, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
Idaho Voices for Children Policy Director Hillarie Matlock said the Legislature needs to let policies from last year’s Medicaid laws from the state and federal government play out.
The governor’s proposed cuts would “only drive up the state’s costs down the road,” she said. 
“If cost containment is the long-term goal, cutting any of these services is not the way to do it,” Matlock told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. “These services are essential to Idahoans with disabilities, children and seniors, and will only drive up costs down the road.” 
In a statement, the governor’s spokesperson Joan Vargas said the cut ideas “were considered to meet the state’s constitutional requirement for a balanced budget.”
“Adult dental coverage and home- and community-based services were included because they are optional Medicaid benefits under federal law, not mandated by the federal government,” she wrote. “While reductions have impacts, these options were considered to meet the state’s constitutional requirement for a balanced budget.”
 What Idaho Medicaid services is the governor targeting for cuts? 

The governor proposed a total of $45 million in Medicaid cuts next fiscal year. About half of that would come from extending 4% doctor pay cuts. The other half – the $22 million in extra Medicaid cuts – would come from a list of options for other Medicaid cuts. 
Little’s list of Medicaid cut options didn’t recommend repealing Medicaid expansion, as some Republican state lawmakers are considering. 
Here’s what options the governor proposed:

Rate reductions: To hospital rates, to residential habilitation, and even removing administrative costs for contracts for managed care organizations, which are private companies that run Medicaid benefits.
Removing services made up the bulk of the governor’s proposed options for Medicaid cuts. Services that could be cut include: adult dental services, home and community-based services, pharmacy benefits for adults who aren’t on Medicaid expansion, adult prosthetics and orthotics, adult in-home nursing services, adult chiropractic services, adult audiology services, adult vision services, hospice services, case management support, and services for physical, occupational and speech therapy.

It’s not immediately clear if services called for removal would be entirely ended under the governor’s proposed cuts.

Last week, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare announced it was capping visits for occupational, physical and speech therapy at 20 per year. Any more visits need prior authorization, but some services would be exempt from the cap, according to the agency’s announcement.
In a statement, Department of Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter said the change aligns Idaho’s programs with other states. The agency doesn’t know how much the change will save the state, he said. 
“Idaho Medicaid regularly reviews its policies to ensure consistency with best practices,” McWhorter said. “Prior to this change, a provider had to order physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy, but Idaho Medicaid did not authorize that the service was medically necessary before it was rendered.”
 After cutting Medicaid dental coverage post-recession, Idaho restored service after ER costs surged

After the Great Recession, the Idaho Legislature in 2011 cut Medicaid dental coverage for adults in hopes to save money.
But three years later, the Legislature was already working to restore adult dental Medicaid coverage after emergency-room costs surged, the Associated Press reported. 
In 2018, as the Legislature approved restoring non-emergency dental coverage for adults, the move was projected to save the state $2.5 million, the Spokesman-Review reported.

Once we understand how bias distorts what we see, we can take steps to correct our own vision, writes columnist Rod Miller.
The post ‘Rashomon’ and death in Minneapolis appeared first on WyoFile .","In a rainy Japanese forest, a samurai is murdered and his wife is raped. At the trial of the accused, several eyewitnesses, including the wife and the accused man, relate completely different versions of what they saw. This is the narrative of Akira Kurosawa’s 1950 cinema masterpiece “Rashomon.”

Opinion

Kurosawa’s film explores the phenomenon of multiple people seeing the same event, yet coming to very different conclusions about what they saw. It also examines the reasons for this disagreement about the truth among rational people.
“Rashomon” is good reference material for us when we think about and react to the killing of Renee Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis, and the competing narratives that have arisen about what really happened.
During the course of the film, each witness and their individual backgrounds and beliefs are described, and questions are asked regarding those external effects on the witnesses’ perception of the crime. Each witness comes from a different level of the class system in post-feudal Japan, and each has their own experience with power and justice in their society.
Each witness is also motivated by personal imperatives like how their neighbors will perceive them after they testify, what they can gain from the outcome of the trial and what they will put at risk by telling the truth. Personal animosities, affections and grudges also weigh heavily on each person’s testimony.
Even a mystic Shinto monk, who claims to channel the voice of the murdered samurai, is called to testify, and that testimony widely diverges from all the other perceptions of the event. In “Rashomon,” even the victim has his own unique understanding of what happened to him based largely upon a lifelong devotion to the samurai code of Bushido.

Columnist Rod Miller.(Mike Vanata)

No cell phones or body cams digitally recorded the murder in that rainy forest, so there’s no record, other than human memories, of the event. In fact, I don’t recall a single example of technology in the whole movie. No telephones, televisions or automobiles, just human beings with their widely varied ideas about the truth of what happened.
But there exist many recorded images of Renee Good dying at the hands of an ICE agent, and it seems like a new recording emerges daily with a different angle of the killing. Video recordings don’t lie. A camera has no cultural bias nor a political bone to pick. It just captures an event that can be viewed over and over again.
And yet, with all of the photographic and video evidence available to us, there is still an argument raging over what really happened in that cold Minneapolis street. The videos and pictures, which should have answered everyone’s questions, seem to have instead intensified the debate.
Why is that?
Because each person seeing the video isn’t seeing it objectively, but rather through the subjective lens of their own lifetime of experience, cultural and religious teaching, political bias and all the other factors coloring the witnesses’ testimony in “Rashomon.” In short, we see what we want to see.
That is precisely how different viewers of the same video can claim it offers different “proof.” The ICE agent was the aggressor. Renee Good was the aggressor. It was self-defense. It was murder. And so on.
The viewer’s societal and political biases paint the picture the viewer wants to see. In the case of this killing in Minneapolis, millions of different viewers reach wildly different conclusions for different reasons based on the same visual evidence.
Cognitive traps such as these biases are incredibly difficult to overcome because they make up so much of how we think of ourselves as good citizens. But they cloud the world before our eyes, and make objective truth hard to see. And I don’t mean just what happened on the street in Minneapolis, but everywhere around us.
I don’t believe in a magic wand that can instantly correct our collective myopia and remove the scales from our eyes, but I do think that, once we understand that our biases distort what we see, then we can take steps to correct our own vision.
And once we see more clearly, we can act more intelligently.

Leaders of the state legislative committee tasked with making compensation recommendations for the state’s 25,000 employees told the Idaho Capital Sun on Tuesday they aren’t sure whether the joint committee will meet at all this year. 
The joint Change in Employee Compensation, known as CEC, Committee, typically starts meeting ahead of the legislative session and again early in the session to make its recommendation to the budget-writing committee. 
“We’re still thinking over the CEC issue,” committee Co-Chair Sen. Dan Foreman, R-Moscow, said Tuesday. “Obviously, the budget’s an issue this year, more so than normal.” 
Heading into the 2026 legislative session, the state is facing an estimated $600 million to $1 billion budget shortfall for the next fiscal year. 
Gov. Brad Little’s proposal to balance the budget includes no adjustment of employee salaries, based on current revenue projections, according to the Legislative Budget Book. 
“Should revenue projections indicate sufficient funding, the Governor recommends prioritizing change in employee compensation to ensure state employee pay remains competitive,” the budget book said.

 Idaho Legislature’s budget committee is scheduled to set ‘maintenance’ budgets on Jan. 23

Increasing health care costs mean that state employees will see an estimated 7.3% increase in out-of-pocket costs for health and dental insurance costs, according to the governor’s budget proposal. Employees may see increases between $29 and $654 per year, depending on the plan type and the number of dependents enrolled. 
CEC Committee Co-Chair Rep. James Holtzclaw, R-Meridian, said Tuesday he wasn’t sure if the committee would meet, but that the health care increase concerned him. 
“I think it’s important for us to keep employees whole,” he said. “I really think we have the best employees, and we want to just keep them happy.” 
The budget-writing Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee is scheduled to set statewide “maintenance budgets” on Jan. 23. These bare-bones agency budgets include previously approved spending, with new requests considered in subsequent “enhancement budgets.” 
House Speaker Mike Moyle in a press conference Monday said he hasn’t had discussions regarding employee compensation. 
“We have some of the best employees ever … We love these guys, and we share their concerns, and we’ll do what we can to help them,” Moyle said when asked about employee raises. “But maybe this year it’s going to be a little off the table.” 
 Idaho HR report shows 14% turnover, and salaries lagging behind market 

The Idaho Division of Human Resources’ annual workforce report found the state experienced 14.6% turnover in 2025, and had an 11.2% vacancy rate. 
The report found the state’s average base salary is 15% behind the 50th percentile of the public and private sector. 
The findings in the report prompted CEC committee member Rep. John Gannon, D-Boise, to call for the committee to meet and consider wage increases for employees. He told the Sun he has been requesting a meeting. 
“No business or government can operate efficiently with this kind of dysfunctional employment,” Gannon said in a written statement. “… the best employees will be encouraged to seek comparable employment elsewhere.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)As the Tennessee Legislature reconvenes this week, Republicans have signalled that immigration, for a second year in a row, will be a central policy priority.
A Republican supermajority controls both the Tennessee House and Senate. On Monday House Speaker Cameron Sexton told reporters the Republican caucus plans to unveil a package of immigration-related legislation this week, crafted in collaboration with White House Homeland Security advisor Stephen Miller. Sexton offered few specifics. 
Separately, and ahead of the January 30 bill-filing deadline, a series of bills already introduced highlight Republican priorities for policies aimed at immigrants living unlawfully in Tennessee, a population estimated at 160,000-190,000 or 3%-4% of the state’s population. 
“Tennessee has long been a beacon for state-led immigration restriction and this session will be no different,” Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, an Oak Ridge Republican said in a statement to the Lookout.
“The federal government under President (Donald) Trump has put a priority on sealing our borders and hastening the return of illegal immigrants to their native lands. We will do all we can to assist in that effort,” he said. 
The Tennessee Republicans’ immigration agenda is expected to draw intense pushback, as it did last year when throngs of protestors flooded the Capitol on a near-daily basis to protest a slate of bills targeting immigrants.
Tennessee lawmakers to take immigration cues from White House

On Tuesday, protests bookended the opening and close of the first day of the 2026 session as protestors condemning ICE commingled with those speaking out against anti-drag legislation.
“More Tennesseans than ever are ready to show up at the Capitol, contact their representatives, and defend their neighbors,” said Lisa Sherman Luna, executive director of TIRRC votes, the political action arm of the state’s largest immigrant advocacy group the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition.
“We won’t watch quietly while our communities are targeted for harm and while ICE escalates violence against the people we love.”
The group helped rally protestors for weeks at the Capitol in the spring in opposition to a host of immigrant related legislation including a measure to bar children without lawful status from public schools. 
While the measure failed to pass last year, House Leader William Lamberth, a Portland Republican, did not rule out reviving the bill this year.
Despite protests, Republicans last year easily passed measures targeting immigrants and those who aid them, including creating a new crime for those who “harbor” immigrants and new law giving law enforcement the power to order observers to stand back 25 feet. Both laws are currently being challenged in court. 
Legislation enacted in 2025 also included the establishment of a state-level immigration enforcement office to coordinate with the federal government, $5 million in grants to local law enforcement that enter into agreements with ICE and markers on license plates to identify legal immigrants who are not citizens. Immigrants without legal status cannot obtain a Tennessee drivers’ license.
Immigration bills introduced thus far in 2026 include  SB1466, measure by Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, a Franklin Republican, to shield information about immigration enforcement operations from public view, including the identities of local and state law enforcement officers involved in them. 
Tennessee House passes immigration enforcement bill; ACLU plans legal challenge

The bill is widely seen as aimed at the actions of Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell during a mass immigration dragnet in Nashville during May that led to the detention of about 200 people during traffic stops.
O’Connell continued to enforce a longstanding executive order requiring city departments to report interactions with immigration officials, posting them publicly. The public posts temporarily revealed the names of federal immigration officials – inadvertently, the mayor’s office said. But the postings drew blowback from Trump administration officials as well as Republican lawmakers. 
Johnson’s bill would create felony charges for public officials who release such information, punishable by six-year prison terms and fines.
Johnson also introduced a bill, SB1587, creating a misdemeanor crime for immigrants without lawful presence to operate commercial vehicles in the state and requiring notice to immigration authorities. 
Sen. Brent Taylor, a Memphis Republican, introduced SB1486 to require jails to keep immigrants without lawful presence in custody 48 hours beyond their release date to allow for federal immigration officials time to pick them up. 
Democrats have also introduced several bills weeks ahead of the filing deadline. 
A day after Minneapolis resident Renee Good was shot by an ICE agent, Rep. Gabby Salinas filed a bill, HB1482, that would prohibit ICE personnel from going onto the grounds of public schools and churches without notice. 
In a statement Salinas said the bill was in response to “countless reports of ICE officers patrolling and surveilling neighborhoods, schools and church communities” since the Memphis Safe Task Force convened by President Donald Trump in September dispatched more than 1,000 federal law enforcement agents, including ICE and Border Patrol, to Memphis.
“No child or person should fear being abducted or risk having their family ripped apart when they leave their home,” the statement said. “We are losing friends, neighbors, caretakers, and community members daily.”
On Tuesday, Nashville Democratic Rep. Justin Jones filed legislation titled the “Stop American Gestapo Act,” which bars federal, local and state law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings while on duty, with certain exceptions for health and safety reasons. The bill, HB1442, also requires law enforcement to clearly display their names and badge numbers.
More immigrant-related bills are expected to be introduced by members of both parties in the weeks ahead.

RJ May, pictured at the Statehouse in Columbia, S.C., on Dec. 4, 2024, is facing up to 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to sending videos of child sexual abuse. (Photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Federal prosecutors want former Rep. RJ May to spend 20 years in prison for distributing videos of children being sexually abused, while the West Columbia Republican is asking a judge to give him a much more lenient sentence.
U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie will make a final decision during a Wednesday hearing as to how long the 39-year-old must spend in federal prison. May, a founding member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus, pleaded guilty in September to sending videos depicting child sexual abuse over a five-day span in April 2024.
Along with prison time, May must pay a fee to the children shown in the photos and videos he sent who the government was able to reach. Prosecutors are asking for $73,000, plus a lifetime of supervision following his release. May will also have to register as a sexual offender. And, as a convicted felon, the former campaign consultant will no longer be allowed to vote or hold office.
The sentence prosecutors are asking Currie to consider is the maximum May can face based on a number of factors, including his lack of a previous criminal history, the number of videos linked to his online accounts and his guilty plea, according to court documents filed ahead of Wednesday’s hearing.
May’s public defense attorneys argued in their subsequent filings that his actions, while heinous, represented a momentary dark spot in his life and that he learned his lesson during his six months in jail. Instead of requesting a specific number of years, May’s attorneys asked only that Currie give him less than prosecutors requested.
After opting to represent himself in the months leading up to his guilty plea, May rehired his taxpayer-funded attorneys for his sentencing hearing.
In a letter to the judge, May proposed five years in prison, followed by “a significant period of home confinement” that would allow him to start earning money to pay restitution and start a nonprofit dedicated to ending the distribution of videos showing child sexual abuse.
May resigned his House seat in August. His successor, Lexington County pastor John Lastinger, was sworn in Tuesday, the first day of the legislative session.
Currie’s decision won’t end May’s legal troubles. He’s also facing state charges of evading income taxes for three years, amounting to $14,637. That case, which could carry up to a year in state prison for each year of unpaid taxes, is ongoing.
Prosecutors’ arguments
For at least five days, May lived a double life, prosecutors wrote in court filings. Within seconds, he could switch from messages about campaigns, legislation and holiday greetings to videos of prepubescent children being forced to perform sex acts.
As a legislator, May frequently voted in favor of bills intended to protect children, including from the exact sort of crimes he later pleaded guilty to committing, prosecutors wrote.
“In public, he represented more than 41,000 Lexington County residents in the legislature; in private, he abused infants, toddlers, and prepubescent minors in child pornography,” prosecutors wrote.
Although May’s video spree seemed to span less than a week based on the evidence investigators were able to recover, prosecutors have long argued this likely wasn’t his only foray into that world.
Messages May sent from a messaging account under the username “joebidennnn69” referenced encrypted apps often used to exchange illegal videos because their overseas owners prevent investigators from accessing their data, according to court documents.
During the five days investigators could identify, May sent 220 different videos of child sexual abuse to people in 18 states and six countries. He sought out videos of children as young as toddlers being abused by their parents, according to court filings.
“All of the victims in May’s videos were too young to protect themselves, but many were old enough such that they will remember their abuse,” prosecutors wrote. “The content May sought out, possessed, and distributed represents some of the most degrading and damaging content that comes before any court.”
For nine survivors of videotaped child sexual abuse, including eight who appeared in videos May sent, the pain is compounded by knowing strangers still see what they went through and often get pleasure from it, they said in statements to the court.
Some of the survivors, referred to under pseudonyms to protect their identities, have children of their own, they said in their statements. Some described lives lived in constant fear and anxiety over someone recognizing them from the videos they know are still circulating.
“There is not one day that goes by that I don’t think, with hatred, about the sick and disgusting people who view, trade, save, and get off on my abuse when I was just a little kid and couldn’t defend myself,” one survivor wrote. “It is sickening.”
Prosecutors tracked down 12 other children shown in videos May sent and received who opted not to submit statements of their own. Investigators also found videos on May’s devices recovered through a search warrant that showed May having sex with young women, apparently forcefully, during a trip to the country Colombia, according to court documents.
Agents have not been able to track down the women or learn how old they were, according to the court filing. May faces no charges related to those videos.
But prosecutors felt they showed his character and underscored their argument for a lengthy prison sentence, they wrote in court filings.
“May, of all people, knew better,” prosecutors wrote. “He was in a unique position to understand the harm and the consequences he would face, yet he still chose to distribute child pornography. Hundreds of times over.”
May’s argument
For six months, unless he was in court, May has spent every hour of the day alone and all but one locked in a 96-square-foot cell. He has access to a tablet he can use to message relatives, read digital books, listen to music and take online classes, but that’s all.
May spends most of his days lying in bed, he wrote in a six-page letter to Currie. Other inmates can hear him crying through the air vents, they wrote in letters of their own.
May’s political ambitions and career both ended with his guilty plea, and he has “been made penniless,” he wrote. May struggles to sleep, and when he does, he often dreams of his arrest last June.
“The sounds of my crying children, the indescribable look on my wife’s face, and the sight of tears streaming down my son’s cheeks are vividly recalled nightly,” May wrote.
The day May pleaded guilty, his wife of 20 years served him with divorce papers, his attorneys wrote in the filing pleading for leniency in his sentence.
Regardless of his prison sentence, May knows he won’t watch his son and daughter, who are 7 and 3 years old, grow up. He’ll miss Christmas mornings, lost teeth, bedtimes, tea parties and soccer games, he wrote.
“The extent of my pain is beyond the power of vocabulary to describe,” May wrote. “So torturous are the thoughts of life without my wife and children.”
May’s attorneys emphasized that none of his charges suggested he harmed any children directly. He didn’t organize his illicit videos and photographs, as is common among people who collect such images, suggesting this was a brief, albeit heinous, lapse of judgment, his attorneys wrote.
“Though it is beyond difficult to explain his ultimate conduct, RJ has accepted responsibility for his actions and in looking back on his actions recognizes that he had (or still has) addiction problems,” his attorneys wrote. “Like so many of us, RJ was addicted to screens whether because of work or family obligations. Furthermore, he admits he was also addicted to viewing pornography on those screens.”
The natural consequences of May’s actions are enough to make him recognize the wrongness of his actions, his attorneys wrote. He vowed in his letter never to reoffend, and his attorneys consider it unlikely he would reoffend.
“RJ has experienced profound loss,” his attorneys wrote. “He will not return to the home and family he knew. He will not be a father to his children. His sin and shame has been broadcast throughout the country. He is shattered.”
May had a tumultuous childhood, including years living in poverty with his mother, who heavily used drugs, according to court filings. She often left May and his younger sister alone for long periods of time, and she hit May on several occasions, according to court documents.
Although May earned a scholarship to the University of South Carolina and eventually created a good life for himself, the trauma lingered, his attorneys wrote.
After May’s prison sentence, he hopes to build a tiny home on his father and stepmother’s 29-acre farm in Virginia, where he was born. There, he wants to revive his retired father’s landscaping business to earn money for his restitution costs and to send to his ex-wife and children.
May also outlined plans to start a nonprofit dedicated to spreading awareness of the harms child sexual abuse material causes and the consequences people can face for exchanging photos and videos of child abuse.
“I know building a future won’t be easy,” May wrote. “There will be no fancy cars or big houses. No glamorous vacations or expensive meals. It will take hard work and dedication to overcome my failures.
“But if anyone can do it, I can. I’ve not given up on myself and I’m asking this Court not to give up on me either. I can once again be a productive member of society, a beacon of hope and motivation to those similarly situated.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_0994-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-14 06:58:48.576700

Rep. Fulcher proposes exploration of transferring Idaho federal land to state and local control 

That’s the snake oil sale being peddled by Congressman Russ Fulcher. Citing a “lack of management” by federal land agencies as the primary reason, Fulcher is seeking to build momentum for “a transition of land management responsibility to state and local entities.” 
Fulcher has issued a letter to Idaho’s constitutional officers, state legislators and county commissioners underscoring “the importance of encouraging local resource management.” Just noting the crowd Fulcher is contacting paints a pretty clear picture of how this effort, if successful, would ultimately play out.
Fulcher bemoaning the lack of federal management ignores the role he and the rest Idaho’s Republican congressional delegation played in creating any such crisis. All four Republicans sat stone faced, quiet and missing in action last year as the Trump administration slashed thousands of jobs and millions of budget dollars from the land management agencies – budgets already approved by Congress. So if there’s lack of land manager presence and action on Idaho’s public lands, Fulcher and the rest of Idaho’s Republican delegation need only to look in the mirror for much of the reason.
Congressman Russ Fulcher, R-Idaho (Photo courtesy of Russ Fulcher’s official website)
Fulcher claims that he hears “all the time” that other members of Congress are tired of subsidizing states like Idaho which have large tracts of public lands. I suspect that’s true – in the cloistered, closed Washington, D.C., Republican bubble the Idaho delegation seems to occupy 24/7 these days there probably is a lot of griping about public lands. 
But I also suspect that there are constituents in the states represented by the gripers who have visited Craters of the Moon National Monument, Redfish Lake, Hells Canyon, the Middle Fork Salmon, and the Selway River and who think that Idaho’s public lands are a pretty good thing.
Fulcher champions “better stewardship through local stakeholder involvement – the state, counties, municipalities, tribes, ranchers, and private operators, all working together …” For over 20 years I was a member of the Owyhee Initiative, a collaboration in Owyhee County formed by the Owyhee County commissioners that included county representatives, ranchers, outfitters, conservationists and consultation with tribal members. 
The Owyhee Initiative was seen as one of the most successful broad-based collaboratives in Idaho. The Owyhee Initiative worked through many tough, contentious issues, but not once, not ever, did anyone in the collaborative say that in order to succeed, we needed to turn the public land in Owyhee County over to state management. No one offered that as a solution to any problem.
And the bottom line to Fulcher’s proposal is that management of public land by the state of Idaho means micro-management by the Republican ideologues in the Idaho Legislature, which essentially amounts to the same thing as putting groups like the Idaho Freedom Foundation in charge. 
Time and again Republicans have shown there is issue is too small for them to meddle with. For 10 years the Idaho Legislature refused to let the Idaho Fish and Game Department have a role in wolf management after the successful reintroduction effort. The Legislature’s answer to disease conflicts between domestic sheep and wild bighorn sheep was to encourage killing the bighorns. Republican senators in the Legislature even refused to support a resolution celebrating the anniversary of the Sawtooth National Recreation Area, arguably the most popular public land destination in Idaho, for fear it would show they supported the concept of public lands. 
These are the same folks telling local governments what flags they can and can’t fly and what pedestrian street safety modifications cities can pursue. No chance the Legislature would take a pass on hot button topics like salmon restoration, wildlife highway overpasses or forest fuels management.
The Republican regime in Idaho state government would see Idaho’s public land heritage as nothing more than vast wood lots, gravel pit sites and mining ventures. Just this past year Gov. Brad Little was in Idaho’s backcountry fawning over the proposed mine at Stibnite, a mine which threatens further pollution of important salmon supporting rivers and tribal rights. 
Can you ever imagine Little going to such lengths to praise, say, a conservation easement that protects public access and recreation, or to celebrate recovery efforts for fisheries on the Yankee Fork? 
No, I can’t either.

Nico Rios, R-Williston, speaks during a legislative hearing on April 3, 2025. He is not seeking reelection in 2026. (Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)A controversial Williston lawmaker said he will not seek reelection this year.
Rep. Nico Rios, a Republican, told the North Dakota Monitor Tuesday he will not seek his party’s endorsement during the NDGOP District 23 convention on Saturday. He said he plans to focus on his career and personal life when his term expires at the end of the year.
“I’m real busy at work, and it’s cost me a lot of time away from my personal life for the last four years,” Rios said. 
In 2023, Rios was arrested for drunken driving and was captured on an officer’s body camera berating a police officer using homophobic and racist language. The video also showed Rios attempting to use his position to intimidate law enforcement. Republican legislative leadership and the North Dakota Republican Party called on Rios to resign after the incident, which he did not do.
In the aftermath, legislative leadership removed Rios from the interim Judiciary Committee. At the time, House Majority Leader Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson, said it wouldn’t have been appropriate to have law enforcement testify to a committee in which he was a member.
NDGOP leaders ‘troubled’ by legislator’s drunken rant against police

During the 2025 legislative session, district and state Republican party leaders denounced antisemetic comments Rios made on social media about the Jewish heritage of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum.
After the post, Corey Johnson, chair of the District 23 Republicans, said he did not believe Rios had the confidence of the district, but he stopped short of calling for a recall petition to be circulated. 
Rios was elected to the North Dakota House of Representatives in 2022. During last year’s legislative session, he was the primary sponsor of six bills and resolutions. All either failed or were withdrawn, including a resolution that sought to declare that North Dakota acknowledges the kingship of Jesus Christ.

Rios works in the oil and gas industry and said focusing on an election campaign over the next year would limit his opportunities to better his career. 
Johnson said he plans to seek the district’s endorsement for one of its House seats. He added he will turn the gavel for the convention over to the district’s first vice chair once the endorsement process begins.
He also said he’s had informal conversations with multiple other candidates who seemed interested in running for a seat in the Legislature, but none have officially announced their candidacies.
“We’re going to run a fair and impartial process and make sure all of our constituents get their voices heard,” Johnson said. 
Sen. Todd Beard, R-Williston, and Rep. Dennis Nehring, R-Williston, the two other lawmakers representing District 23, are both expected to run for reelection and seek the district’s endorsement on Saturday, Johnson said.

Senate Bill 9, authored by Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, would require a defendant to be present in the courtroom while a victim delivers a statement about the crime and the sentence, unless the defendant poses a safety risk or causes a significant disruption.

The bill cleared the Senate Corrections and Criminal Law Committee in a bipartisan 9-0 vote and now heads to the full Senate.
The legislation was referred to by some supporters as “Aubree’s Law” after 2-year-old Aubree Zent; her siblings, 3-year-old Ashton and 5-year-old Carter; and their 26-year-old mother Sarah, who were killed in Fort Wayne in June 2021. All four died of stab wounds.
Family members told lawmakers that the defendant in the case, 22-year-old Cohen Hancz-Barron, chose not to attend sentencing — forcing them to read their statements in court without him present.
Hancz-Barron was found guilty of the murders and convicted to four life sentences without the possibility of parole.
“During the sentencing phase of the trial, we gave our victim impact statements to an empty chair, as he has the right to refuse to be shown, to come to that part of the trial,” said Jen More, Aubree’s grandmother. “This is unacceptable.”
“This gives no closure to any of the grieving processes that the victims and the victims’ families are going through,” she continued. “As a matter of fact, for me personally, I’m stuck. I’m stuck because I’ve been silenced. … I can’t go any further in my grieving process.”
Making sure victims, families are heard
Under current Indiana law, victims have the right to make statements at sentencing, but courts can proceed even if a defendant is not present. 
Senate Bill 9 would tighten that standard by requiring the defendant’s presence during victim impact statements, with only limited exceptions.
As amended in committee, the legislation specifies that a court can excuse a defendant from the courtroom only if they present a safety risk or cause “a significant disruption,” or if the defendant was tried in absentia or failed to appear for trial. The amended draft also clarifies that sentencing can still proceed in those limited circumstances.
The changes would apply to felony and misdemeanor sentencing hearings beginning July 1.

Brown said multiple families who traveled to testify at Tuesday’s hearing had been waiting “for years” to be heard.
“They wanted the opportunity, after the horrific and brutal murders of these four loved ones, to be able to give their victim impact statement in court — to make sure the defendant understood the pain that he brought to their family,” she said. “And the one day in court that they were there, the defendant was not there. This bill will give them closure.”
Brown additionally emphasized the importance of preventing judges from using absence as a routine workaround.
“In this case, the judge did not require (the defendant) to be there,” she added, “and we just want to make sure that the judge doesn’t use this as a loophole.”
‘This is unacceptable’
Family members repeatedly told lawmakers that victim impact statements are a crucial part of accountability — and the grieving process — and that delivering them without the defendant present compounded their trauma.
Justin More, Aubree’s father, described how being denied an opportunity to speak directly to the defendant stalled his healing.
He said his victim impact statement included forgiveness for the convicted murderer.
“I was trying to move forward, but I never got to that point,” the father told the Senate panel. “(Grieving) is just a very long process, being that I couldn’t read the last words to the person who took my daughter from this world. He wasn’t even man enough to sit up and sit there and listen to what we had to say.”
Travis More, Aubree’s grandfather, told lawmakers the bill would ensure future victim statements do not fall on silent ears.
“Senate Bill 9 will give future grieving victims a chance to face their convicted person and begin the grieving process,” he said. “Ask yourself, before you vote, am I making a difference for the future victims of Indiana?”

Kayley Richardson, Aubree’s aunt, said the family helped draft the legislation because they felt the system failed them.
“In no world is it ever okay that the convicted have more rights than any of their victims or their families,” Richardson said. “There needs to be substantial consequences for such a profound loss.”
Angela Zent, founder of the Sarah Zent Foundation and stepmother to Sarah, testified that victim impact statements are “not legal formalities.”
“They are the final human truth spoken for those who no longer speak for themselves,” she said. “When the defendant is allowed to walk away from that moment, not only is it disrespectful, but it’s also giving him more control and placing more silence on his victims and the families.”
Senators from both sides of the aisle spoke in support of the bill.
“One of the most difficult things to do when you have a homicide is to keep the focus on the victim,” said Sen. Sue Glick, R-LaGrange, a former prosecutor.
She noted that families frequently attend criminal trials and “have to listen to the victim being characterized in many fashions. “Quite often,” Glick said, “the family sits there and endures it.”
“The victim impact statements allow the families to come forward and express to the court, ‘You need to hear this judge. This was a person. These were individuals. These were part of our lives and part of our family who have been taken away,’” Glick continued. “It is very much a part of what should be heard — not for the public, maybe not even for the families themselves — but for the court to hear that this was a living, breathing individual who was lost to society and lost to everyone who ever cared about them.”
Democrat Sen. Rodney Pol, an attorney from Chesterton, further flagged that prosecutors are sometimes prevented from telling a victim’s full story because of discovery rules.
“The idea that you would sit through one of the worst possible tragedies that your family is ever going to go through and not have your voice heard at the end of it — by the person that you feel needs to hear it the most — I think that is one of the most important aspects of being a victim,” Pol said.
Other bills on the move
The Senate corrections committee advanced 11 other measures Tuesday, too.
Senate Bill 271, authored by Sen. Eric Koch, R-Bedford, addresses theft of telecommunications and broadband equipment by tightening rules governing the sale of valuable metals.
Senate committee advances Indiana anti-doxing bill tied to redistricting threats

Another proposal, Senate Bill 160, would add a sentencing aggravator for crimes committed while wearing a mask or other face covering to conceal identity.
Senate Bill 140, also authored by Brown, seeks to criminalize doxing, or the intentional online disclosure of personal information to harass or threaten someone, while Senate Bill 144, another by Koch, would strengthen tobacco and vaping regulations.
Committee chair Sen. Aaron Freeman’s Senate Bill 246 would protect children in court records by requiring the redaction of minors’ names in certain filings, and his Senate Bill 251 separately increases penalties for individuals with prior operating while intoxicated, OWI, convictions.
Multiple measures on the move also deal with bail, including Freeman’s Senate Bill 252, which revises certain bail procedures and conditions for pretrial release.

Jan. 13, 2026 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceOn Tuesday, the Michigan Association of State Universities shared a report detailing the financial impact the state’s 15 public universities have across the state’s economy, bringing in nearly $45 billion in new economic activity while supporting more than 129,000 jobs statewide. 
While unveiling the report, the association’s CEO, Daniel Hurley, joined with university presidents from Michigan State University and Grand Valley State University and representatives from Research Universities for Michigan, the Michigan Health and Hospital Association and the state’s business community for a discussion on how public universities are powering the state’s economy.
As the state heads into the 2026 budget season, Britany Affolter-Caine, the executive director of Research Universities for Michigan, said it’s important to highlight the contributions state universities make to the economy as lawmakers weigh their priorities. 
Breaking down the report’s highlights, Hurley noted that the $44.9 billion net economic impact state universities bring is 28 times the $1.6 billion appropriation the Legislature put into these schools in Fiscal Year 2024. He later noted that university-driven activity produced more than $7.1 billion in state tax revenue, further exceeding the state’s investment into public universities. 
“The bottom line that we want to send today –especially to our friends in the executive branch of state government, in the Legislature, all of our state leaders – is that investing in public universities is not just good education policy, it is smart, high-return economic policy,” Hurley said.

MSU President Kevin Guskiewicz, who sits on the board for Research Universities for Michigan, emphasized the role Michigan’s research universities – Michigan State University, Michigan Technological University, the University of Michigan and Wayne State University – play in attracting resources and talent to the state. 
In 2024, these universities conducted nearly $3.5 billion in research funded by federal agencies and private industry partners, Guskiewicz said. 
“That research activity brings billions of dollars in additional in-state economic activity, supporting high-skilled jobs, specialized suppliers and local businesses across the state of Michigan,” he said. 
Alongside supporting Michigan business, those dollars also help support research partnerships at Michigan’s other public universities, Guskiewicz said.

“The takeaway is simple, Michigan’s public universities are strongest when they are strong together,” Guskiewicz said. “Sustained investment in both broad access and high impact research is what allows Michigan to compete and win in a global innovation-driven economy.”
The report’s release follows the Trump administration’s gutting of federal funding for university research programs, including freezing $8 billion from the National Institutes of Health, which administers many of the grants to universities across the nation. Many of those cuts remain contested in the courts.
While the report focuses on hard numbers to quantify the impacts of Michigan’s public universities, both Hurley and Grand Valley State University President Philomena Mantella noted that there is a bigger story behind the numbers, including the 1.6 million alumni working and living in the state. 
“These aren’t just abstract numbers,” Mantella said. “They represent teachers. They represent class. Teachers in classrooms, nurses and hospitals, engineers and advanced manufacturing, entrepreneurs launching their businesses and scaling them here in Michigan, all which contribute to Michigan’s vitality.”
Grand Valley State University President Philomena Mantella. Jan. 13, 2026 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan Advance
These schools also play a role in ensuring graduates stay in the state, Mantella said, addressing concerns about population and talent loss that have long plagued Michigan. 
Keeping colleges affordable is part of that design, Mantella said, to ensure students graduate with less debt so they can start families, buy homes and launch businesses. 
Additionally, if Michigan is going to grow its population and strengthen its economy, state universities will need to ensure they are aligning their education with the needs of the state, Mantella said, noting that many of the state’s most in-demand jobs require a bachelor’s degree or higher.
Brian Peters, the CEO of the Michigan Health and Hospital Association, said the state’s health care industry relies on a steady stream of nurses, doctors, technicians, administrators and more, with the demand for health care workers increasing. Even with 58,000 new employees hired in 2024, Michigan’s health care industry is still in need of 23,000 employees, Peters explained. 
“For us to continue delivering safe, accessible, high quality care, we need a workforce pipeline that is strong, that’s diverse, and that’s prepared to work in this very rapidly evolving environment. And that’s where the collaboration with our university partners truly comes in,” Peters said, noting that efforts ranging from undergraduate programs to clinical training partnerships help expand the pool of caregivers in the state.

While the economic footprint of Michigan’s universities is significant, the way that care feels for those who need it is all the more important, Peters said, crediting university partnerships with helping to build a network of compassionate professional and committed care among those who stay in the state.
“These are our neighbors who are delivering babies at three in the morning, stitching wounds on holidays, handling emergency room surges at all hours of the day and night,” Peters said. “They are the heart of every hospital in Michigan. These incredible individuals, and they show up every day with compassion, professionalism and commitment, and that is why this human connection and this relationship with our universities is so critically important.”

(Photo by Leann Ray/West Virginia Watch)Following widespread allegations of child care fraud in Minnesota, a West Virginia official told lawmakers on Tuesday that similar issues haven’t been found here. 
The federal government sends money to states to subsidize the cost of care for low-income children. Many working parents across the state rely on the Child Care and Development Fund to afford child care; the average annual cost of care at a licensed child care center in West Virginia is more than $6,000 per child. 
Alex J. Mayer, secretary of the West Virginia Department of Human Services
“We haven’t found any fraud to date within the child care system. We are doing a lot of examinations internally, not just in child care but across all our programs,” Alex Mayer, secretary of the West Virginia Department of Human Services, told lawmakers during a meeting Tuesday at the state Capitol.
Mayer responded to a question from Del. Kathie Hess Crouse, R-Putnam, who asked if DoHS had found any evidence of child care subsidy fraud after what happened in Minnesota. A 2019 state investigation found that there was likely several million dollars in child care fraud taking place within Minnesota’s system linked to the federal subsidy program. 
Additional overpayment issues with Minnesota’s child care centers were flagged last year. 
In response to the fraud allegations, the U.S. The Department of Health and Human Services froze all federal funding for the child care subsidy program in five Democratic-led states, including Minnesota. A federal judge last week temporarily blocked the Trump administration from stopping the subsidies after the five states sued over the matter.
There is no evidence to support large-scale child care fraud nationwide. 
In West Virginia, some child care providers have said up to 90% of their enrolled children receive the subsidy, and centers that accept children on subsidies will bill the state for the cost of caring for those kids.
“It comes as no surprise to me that Secretary Alex Mayer reported no findings of child care fraud to date. West Virginia child care providers operate with honesty and integrity, often under extraordinary financial strain,” said Tiffany Gale, owner and director of Miss Tiffany’s School for Young Children, a licensed family child care facility in Weirton. 
Mayer said DoHS has implemented additional oversight on child care providers.
“We want to work with providers to understand how to make things better for them and with them,” he said.
Jennifer Trippett, owner of Cubby’s Child Care Center in Bridgeport that serves 460 kids, said, “Child care providers need the ability to operate their programs without excessive and unnecessary bureaucracy. … So they can stay focused on what matters most — caring for children and supporting working families.”
“Providers across the state work tirelessly to deliver high-quality care for the most vulnerable children in our communities. Secretary Mayer has now clarified that the recent increase in documentation requests was intended to verify potential fraud — and that none has been identified,” she continued. 
As West Virginia’s 60-day legislative session begins Wednesday, child care providers will ask lawmakers to address pressing issues with child care statewide. More than 25,000 children in West Virginia don’t have access to child care, and more than 150 child care providers have closed their classrooms over the last year.
Last year, while some state lawmakers on both sides of the aisle pushed for child care expansion, a number of child care measures failed to get up for a full vote in the GOP-led Senate and House of Delegates. 
“While we are not surprised by [Mayer’s] report, it does not negate the very real issue facing our state: West Virginia has consistently disinvested in child care infrastructure,” Gale said. “Since 2017, state investment has dropped sharply — from roughly $11 million annually to about $3 million annually by 2021, where it has remained through 2024. This dramatic reduction has occurred even as the cost of care, workforce shortages and inflation continue to rise.”
This session, child care providers plan to ask lawmakers to increase the amount for its child care subsidy to align with the cost of providing care. They’d also like to see the Legislature pass a “child care workforce scholarship act” that establishes child care scholarships for all child care employees to help with training and retention. 
“Child care is the backbone of our economy. When we defund child care, we destabilize families, employers, and entire communities,” Gale said, adding that changes this session are essential to the industry.

(Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado lawmakers return to work Wednesday for their annual 120-day regular legislative session, and the buzzword of the next four months will once again be affordability.
“The Colorado we’re working towards is one where everyone has a chance to work hard and get ahead,” Senate President James Coleman, a Denver Democrat, told reporters Tuesday. “Where high-quality health care is accessible to all without breaking the bank, our K-12 students and educators have what they need to succeed, and every hard working family can afford housing, health care, child care and higher education. This is what we’re working towards.”
Cost-of-living concerns have been a major theme for both Democrats and Republicans the last few years at the Legislature, as lawmakers passed bills focused on spurring new housing development, bolstering consumer protections and advancing tenants’ rights. It has become more salient as the federal government freezes or outright cuts funding for some safety-net programs in the state.
“We’re facing an uphill battle amid recent attacks from the Trump administration and the federal GOP, including hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for child care, food assistance, job training and other crucial services that keep Colorado families afloat,” House Majority Leader Monica Duran, a Wheat Ridge Democrat, said. “Colorado Democrats are laser focused on this session to pass legislation that will drive down costs.”

Democrats hold wide majorities in both the House and Senate and can pass their agenda without bipartisan support, but high costs are top of mind for both parties.
“We need to focus on the issues we’ve been hearing most about, which are affordability and crime,” House Minority Leader Jarvis Caldwell, a Colorado Springs Republican, told Newsline. “My colleagues across the aisle are hearing the same concerns, and so we are trying to get things done in a bipartisan fashion on those issues.”
Republicans have new leadership in both chambers. Sen. Cleave Simpson, an Alamosa Republican, replaced former Minority Leader Paul Lundeen over the summer when Lundeen took a job leading a conservative nonprofit. Caldwell took over as the leader of the House Republicans when former Minority Leader Rose Pugliese resigned following a special session last year. Pugliese and Duran had a public falling out on the House floor.










Colorado Democrats are laser focused on this session to pass legislation that will drive down costs.


– State House Majority Leader Monica Duran


Caldwell said he views his caucus’s role as being the “adults” in the chamber. Since Republicans cannot pass any legislation on their own, however, their job requires working with Democrats to see their ideas make it through the legislative process.
“If there’s a bill that we do not agree with, that we can’t stop with our numbers, our role is to work across the aisle to get amendments and get wins, especially if the bill is going to pass regardless,” he said.
Another budget shortfall
Lawmakers will be constrained by a tight fiscal environment — this is similar to last year — and to pass a balanced budget they will need to find about $800 million in funding cuts. That is the gap between how much it would cost to fund the government at the current level and how much the state actually has to spend.
“It’s not going to be easy, but we are required to pass a balanced budget, and Democrats and Republicans will have to come together to protect the services our constituents need,” Coleman said.
The primary force behind that budget shortfall is ballooning costs for Medicaid, which provides health insurance for low-income Coloradans. Coverage and use of the program have expanded while the cost of care keeps rising.
The state’s coffers haven’t kept up, partially due to the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights. That constitutional amendment limits how much the government can keep in tax revenue and spend for programs and services without voter approval. The cap is based on inflation and population growth, and program costs are outpacing inflation. The restriction has long drawn ire from Democrats, who argue it prevents the state from investing in areas like education, infrastructure and health care.
Medicaid costs have grown much faster than the TABOR cap and now make up the biggest share of the budget. It’s an imbalance that is projected to worsen, which is why Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, wants to find a strategy to curb Medicaid cost growth. His proposed budget suggests a $300 million increase to the program next fiscal year, less than half of the projected cost increase.
“What we face is an explosion in Medicaid expenses due to an older and grayer Colorado,” House Speaker Julie McCluskie, a Dillon Democrat, said during a legislative preview breakfast hosted by the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday. “There isn’t a way for us to get out of this budget situation except to tackle health care.”
McCluskie also wants Colorado to consider adjusting the spending cap.
“Thirty years after TABOR (was passed), it’s time that we have that conversation,” she said. “It doesn’t mean getting rid of it. It doesn’t mean that we don’t still think about the way we control or channel government spending. It just means that we’ve got to do it in a better, more effective way so that we’re meeting the priorities we hear about from our constituents.”
Last year, lawmakers made the budget work — it was a $1.2 billion shortfall then — with one-time spending cuts and other accounting maneuvers that prevented severe damage to essential services. This time, many of those levers aren’t available, which could mean more painful cuts.
“With the budget shortfall Colorado is facing, we’re going to have some tough decisions to make this session,” Caldwell said. “Do we look at areas we can cut or do we look at how to raise revenue? Obviously, my position is looking at where we can cut spending.”
The six-member, bipartisan Joint Budget Committee has already begun its work of crafting the state budget. That legislation typically gets passed in the latter half of the session.
Revisiting bills from 2025
Democrats will once again vote on a bill to repeal the state’s Labor Peace Act, a 1940s law that requires a unique second union election in Colorado for workers to negotiate some aspects of their contract. Last year, it was one of the first bills to be introduced but one of the last to pass, as business groups and labor interests tried to negotiate a compromise that would appease Polis. It passed unchanged and Polis vetoed it.
Democrats will consider it again this year, and that tension with the governor’s office will likely remain.
Additionally, lawmakers will need to decide how to proceed with the state’s artificial intelligence anti-discrimination law, set to go into effect in June. First passed in 2024, the law was immediately controversial among tech companies and some businesses, which worry it is too rigid and will stifle innovation. Proponents of the basics of the law want to curb bias in AI programs and set up a framework so consumers and affected people know when AI is used in major decisions related to areas like their employment and finances.
A task force met in 2024 to work out a policy solution, but a bill to tweak it during last year’s legislative session failed. Polis then charged the Legislature to include the issue during the special session last summer, but talks broke down, and lawmakers passed a bill to push back the implementation date. That gives them this regular session to find a path forward.
“There is still so much I want to accomplish, including solving the AI puzzle once and for all,” Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez, a Denver Democrat, said.
New leadership and an election year
There will also be interpersonal tension and the dynamic of an election year at play this legislative session. It is the final session for McCluskie and Duran in the House and the final year for Rodriguez in the Senate.
It is also Polis’ final session as governor.
While many legislators will be running to retain their seat in the Capitol — or move from the House to the Senate — a number are also campaigning for higher office, some against one another. That means they will need to be present in the Legislature and also active on the campaign trail.
Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, a Brighton Republican, and Rep. Scott Bottoms, a Colorado Springs Republican, are both vying for governor.
Sen. Julie Gonzales, a Denver Democrat, and Sen. Mark Baisley, a Woodland Park Republican, are eyeing the U.S. Senate, and Rep. Manny Rutinel, a Commerce City Democrat, is running for the 8th Congressional District.
Rep. Brianna Titone, an Arvada Democrat, and Sen. Jeff Bridges, a Greenwood Village Democrat, are running for state treasurer. Sen. Jessie Danielson, a Wheat Ridge Democrat, is campaigning to be secretary of state.
Also in the background will be an ethics investigation into a weekend retreat attended by members of the Colorado Opportunity Caucus, which comprises moderate Democrats. An ethics complaint alleges that those 16 lawmakers violated the state’s gift ban by allowing pro-business dark money group One Main Street to help pay for the gathering. The inquiry could deepen a rift between moderate and progressive Democrats in the Legislature.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout).The tension between protecting natural resources and sourcing enough water to fuel Middle Tennessee’s growth is once again coming to the statehouse.
Members of the Tennessee General Assembly filed a handful of bills as of Tuesday concerning the Duck River, a scenic river known worldwide for supporting a vast array of freshwater species, including several federally endangered and threatened species. The river also serves as the sole water source for roughly 250,000 people in Middle Tennessee, an area that faces increasing development pressure and intermittent drought periods. Environmental groups have warned for years that drawing more and more water from the river is unsustainable.
One bill seeks to prohibit the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, which regulates water withdrawals from rivers, from stopping any utility that provides drinking water from making withdrawals, regardless of drought conditions. A proposed House Joint Resolution would express support for reconstructing the Columbia Dam, a project that was halted in the 1980s and dismantled in the 1990s.
Another bill would designate several rivers and creeks as Class II pastoral waterways, which would protect those areas from mining, commercial timber harvest, and landfill uses and allow private landowners the option to participate in protections to ensure the land remains pastoral. While portions of the Duck River are already designated as Class II waterways, this bill would stretch the classification to the entire river, except the portion including the Normandy Reservoir, which is managed by the Tennessee Valley Authority. Rep. Pat Marsh, a Shelbyville Republican, did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding this bill.
Bills may still be amended, and the filing deadline for new legislation is Jan. 30.
Taking away regulatory power
A bill introduced by Chapel Hill Republican Rep. Todd Warner would block the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation — which issues water withdrawal permits for utilities — from limiting how much water a utility can withdraw, so long as it is “for the purposes of providing drinking water.”
“I think TDEC has overstepped their bounds in some of these places, especially on the Duck River,” by telling utilities that they must stop pumping if river flow levels drop below a certain threshold, Warner said Tuesday. “Well, we have no backup water, so we’re not going to cease pumping.”
“I think TDEC has overstepped their bounds in some of these places, especially on the Duck River,” said Rep, Todd Warner, a Culleoka Republican, of a bill he filed limiting regulatory power over Duck River water withdrawals. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Warner said he filed the bill because he felt the department did not provide an answer as to what would happen to a utility that kept pumping water despite limitations during low flows. He referenced a permit granted to the Marshall County Board of Public Utilities in August 2021 that included water withdrawal limitations for times of drought, when withdrawals could be fatal to the river’s many inhabitants. Marshall County appealed that permit, asking that withdrawal limitations be removed. The department, The Nature Conservancy and the Tennessee Wildlife Federation reached a settlement with Marshall County in 2022 to keep the limits in place.
Warner noted that the bill does allow the regulatory authority to limit withdrawals if required by federal law — for example, if water is found to be contaminated, or contains federally endangered species. But the bill states that this exemption doesn’t apply if federal law only “recommends” pumping be prohibited. 
At the federal level, President Donald Trump’s administration has been slashing environmental regulations, including proposing rule changes that environmental legislators say would weaken habitat and harm protections for threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. The administration has stated it is removing “regulatory barriers that hinder responsible resource development and economic growth while maintaining core conservation commitments.”
Under Trump, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin proposed a new rule that would cut federal protection for wetlands. In 2025, Tennessee legislators passed a law that lessened state regulatory protections for an estimated 80% of Tennessee wetlands that lack federal protection.
Supporting a second attempt at a Columbia dam
Warner is also sponsoring a resolution that would show “strong support” for the reconstruction of the Columbia Dam, recognizing the project as a “critical priority for the State to establish an adequate water supply system for sustained growth, economic development, and recreational use.”
The initial dam project ran into multiple issues and was ultimately torn down amid a lawsuit over environmental impacts and land, permitting issues with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, rising costs, and a cost-benefit analysis that recommended scrapping the project altogether.
As water needs grow, a group called “Columbia Dam Now” says a new dam is the only way to provide affordable drinking water for the area. An opposing group, “Don’t Dam the Duck,” has concerns about the project’s feasibility and the impact a dam would have on the river’s delicate ecology.
Columbia Dam Now has been working with U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles since mid-2025 to secure congressional funding for a feasibility study for the project. A cost estimate for a modern-day rebuild of the dam has not been released.
Warner, a member of the Columbia Dam Now board, said his goal for this resolution is to help secure that federal funding. The group spent several months in 2025 collecting similar non-binding resolutions from various county and city governments in the area.
Group seeking to build Columbia Dam on Duck River teams with Ogles to pursue federal funds for study

A group of public officials, conservationists and utility representatives have been reviewing possibilities to address water needs in Middle Tennessee at the behest of Gov. Bill Lee, who issued an executive order in November 2024 declaring the river a “scenic treasure” and creating the group to determine how to balance water needs with the river’s health. 
The Duck River Planning Partnership issued its first recommendations in November, including a feasibility study for a pipeline bringing water from the Tennessee River to Middle Tennessee, a feasibility study for regional water solutions, and raising winter water levels in the Normandy Dam, a reservoir that allows the Tennessee Valley Authority to regulate the river’s water flow. 
Rebuilding the Columbia Dam was not among the partnership’s recommendations.
The Mallory Valley Utility District released a study in September that found that a pipeline supplying water from the Cumberland River to Maury and Williamson counties is feasible, but could cost up to $1.9 billion without state or federal help.
Earlier this month, Columbia’s City Council approved water rate hikes of up to 20% per year over the next five years to fund the construction of a new water intake and water treatment plant to serve Columbia Power and Water Systems’ customers. The new intake is permitted by the state’s regulatory department to withdraw up to 32 million gallons of water per day from the river, 12 million gallons more than the current intake.
While Maury County residents said the new rates will place extreme strain on the finances of already struggling families and residents with fixed incomes, the utility’s leaders said the 20% raise per year represents the worst-case scenario, and annual hikes will likely fall below that cap. State officials said the new intake had been under consideration for at least a decade and is the most advanced of all of the proposed solutions in terms of permitting, public hearings and state approvals. 
The project’s permit is among several included in a settlement over environmental protections between the Tennessee Wildlife Federation, represented by the Southern Environmental Law Center, and state regulators. The settlement requires the utilities to follow an updated drought management plan approved by the state’s Department of Environment and Conservation and set goals to limit the amount of water allowed to leak from the utilities’ systems.

(Photo via U.S. Coast Guard courtesy of  by Main Pass Oil Gathering Co., LLC)Let’s say you hired a landscaper to work on your backyard. But they left their trash and broken tools scattered around your property and made you clean it all up. Would you hire that same company to work on your front yard?

The Trump administration would, apparently.

The administration’s proposed five-year program calls for new oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska and, for the first time in decades, off the coast of California. But the same industry that will benefit from Trump’s plan already turned the Louisiana coast into a dumping ground, leaving infrastructure behind to decay and pollute our waters.

We can’t afford more of this. Much of Louisiana’s marine ecosystem has already been sacrificed for profit, and Trump’s plan would be devastating for the Gulf’s remaining manatees, sea turtles, gulf sturgeon and Rice’s whale — one of the world’s most endangered baleen whales, with an estimated population of just 51 animals.

Our sad reality is what happens when the oil industry is allowed to run rampant. It should be a cautionary tale for other states.

There are currently more idle wells than producing wells in the Gulf of Mexico. At least 75% of end-of-lease and idle oil infrastructure off the Gulf Coast is overdue for decommissioning. Hundreds of these wells have sat idle for more than a decade, some far longer. These wells have proven to be dangerous, leaking oil into the water and spewing methane into the atmosphere. In April, Well 59 — an 82-year-old idle well — broke loose and spewed tens of thousands of gallons of pollutants into Louisiana state waters and wetlands.

For decades, operators have also avoided their cleanup obligations, selling off their low-producing wells to smaller companies, leaving their infrastructure to sit idle for some purported future use, or going bankrupt and deserting their platforms. Even though many of these companies raked in enormous profits while their wells were active, their attempts to evade cleanup obligations lead to persistent safety and environmental hazards.

This is California and Alaska’s future if Trump’s five-year plan moves forward. Louisiana can serve as their crystal ball, and the plan deepens the decommissioning crisis in the Gulf.

Long after operators pack up and leave, the underwater world off our coasts will be permanently scarred by rusting platforms and unplugged wells that leak harmful gases and toxins. The fishing industry that helps drive the Gulf Coast and Alaska’s economy could be in peril; so will California’s robust tourism industry and iconic beaches.

This danger is not lost on most coastal politicians, regardless of political party. When news of Trump’s plan first broke, the administration faced so much pushback from states like Florida, South Carolina and Georgia that the entire East Coast was eventually scrapped from the plan. Several top Florida politicians, all Republican, are still working to stop the expansion in the Gulf of Mexico, worried more drilling will harm the state’s tourism industry.

Why should the oil industry expand off the Gulf, California, and Alaska coasts when it can’t even clean up its mess off Louisiana? Once these wells are no longer profitable, the industry will follow its trusted playbook — pack up the equipment that still works and leave the rusting remnants behind for us to deal with.

These companies should be paying to clean up the disaster they created in Louisiana. Instead, they’re bidding on the next marine environment to pollute.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Main-Pass-oil-spill-2023-1024x746.jpg,,,2026-01-14 06:58:48.576700

(Wisconsin Examiner photo)Wisconsinites are holding rallies  across the state Wednesday to call on Congress and the Trump administration to increase funding for operations at the Social Security Administration.
Staff reductions and office closures in the last year have created bottlenecks in service for members of the public who need help from the agency, according to Jessica LaPointe, the Wisconsin-based president of American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Council 220. The union represents field operations employees for the Social Security Administration across the country.
“We’re struggling to meet the needs of the public,” LaPointe said, with more than 10,000 people a day becoming eligible for the federal retirement program.
Along with AFGE, the Wisconsin Alliance for Retired Americans will be rallying outside Social Security offices in eight Wisconsin communities Wednesday.
“When they start closing offices, that hinders our senior citizens,” said Ross Winklbauer, president of WARA. “They call into Social Security if they have a question or to file a claim, and they’re sitting on the phone for hours because of short staffing and not getting their questions answered.”
WARA will take part in a rally starting at 12 noon outside the Social Security offices in the Milwaukee suburb of Greenfield along with AFGE. Rallies are also planned in Eau Claire, Madison, Racine, Rhinelander, Stevens Point, Wausau and Wisconsin Rapids. Winklbauer said WARA has about 100,000 members in the state, mostly union retirees, and about 1,000 active participants.
The rallies are part of a national day of action in anticipation of the possibility that the government will shut down at the end of January if Congress can’t agree on a budget for the rest of the year, LaPointe said.
Talks are underway between congressional Republicans and Democrats to enact the rest of the government’s spending plan for the current year by the upcoming deadline.
Nevertheless, LaPointe said the most recent shutdown that started Oct. 1 and ran for a record 43 days brought home to many field office workers in the Social Service Admin. the limits of their compensation, especially if they are furloughed.
In a report released Wednesday, the Strategic Organizing Center said its review of 36,000 Social Security workers’ pay rates showed that 54% — just over half — were paid less than what the MIT Living Wage Calculator has set as a living wage for the regions of the U.S. where they live. The developers of the calculator at the MIT Living Wage Institute define a living wage as “the rate that a full-time worker requires to cover the costs of their family’s basic needs where they live.”
“We don’t get paid enough to save for a rainy day,” LaPointe said. “We’re understaffed, we’re underpaid and we’re struggling to meet the needs of the public who are coming to us for their earned benefits.”
In January 2025, when President Donald Trump took office, the agency’s staff was at its lowest in 50 years, LaPointe said, and “the public was waiting too long for benefits and services.”
Since then, the agency instituted a buyout program, offering workers up to $25,000 to quit, and the staff dropped from 58,000 a year ago to about 50,000 now — “the largest single staffing cut in Social Security history,” LaPointe said. 
About 2,000 field staff were lost in the last year — 10% of the field operations, she said, with the number of employees at some offices falling to single digits. 
LaPointe said the agency has moved to “digital first” operations that favor online or telephone contacts instead of in-person visits. In addition, the agency has shifted to processing inquiries from the public nationally rather than at the local office she said — “where a customer out in California would be served by someone in Wisconsin, or a customer in Madison might be served by someone in New Jersey.”
In an email message, a Social Security Administration spokesperson depicted the digital shift as part of a modernization program so that “more Americans are choosing to resolve their needs online or over the phone.” The statement cited a recent audit by the Social Security Administration inspector general that found average hold times for callers had dropped to seven minutes by September 2025 from a high of 30 minutes in January.
Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano “has pledged to have the right level of staffing to operate at peak efficiency and deliver best-in-class customer service to the American people,” the spokesperson said.
The Social Security Administration “is taking action to improve workplace satisfaction, support professional development, and enhance communication across all levels of the organization,” the spokesperson added.
LaPointe, however, said there’s been “a breakdown in community based service” with the new system, and Social Security staffers are no longer the face of government in the local community.
“You now have to have an appointment to do anything with Social Security,” LaPointe said. “It’s created a bottleneck of service to where people cannot get access to apply for benefits in a timely fashion.”
Frontline workers are concerned that a move toward using artificial intelligence technology to review benefit applications will increase errors — either benefit approvals that are mistaken or unwarranted denials, she said.
“It still takes a human being to adjudicate claims — every claim, whether on the phone, online or in person,” LaPointe said.

(Photo courtesy of ACLU-WV)As the Supreme Court hears oral arguments in the case of B.P.J. vs. West Virginia this week, the weight of the world must be on Harrison County teenager Becky Pepper-Jackson’s shoulders. Becky — who has been fighting in court for years to simply be allowed to throw shot put and discus on her school’s track team — is now at the center of a media maelstrom as her story reaches the court’s ears, and the stakes have never been higher. The decision in this case will have far-reaching ramifications for children across the United States as the court weighs whether to enshrine biological essentialism into law as part of its interpretation of Title IX.
Amidst my admiration for Becky’s bravery, I have also felt overwhelming waves of disgust with the widespread direct and indirect harassment I have seen coming her way from adults online. In particular, the Office of the West Virginia Attorney General’s obsessive posting about the case has treated the life and liberty of a teenage girl as an engagement farm, making archaic arguments about sex-based differences using complaints from athletes who are not from West Virginia and creating a platform for sharing hate against the one child the state’s “Save Women’s Sports Act” currently effects.
As many West Virginians have pointed out in the comments on these posts, in a state where there are so many other problems, why is the AG devoting this much energy and attention to one girl who simply wants to play? The answer is clear. Republicans have seized onto trans girls — one of the most marginalized populations in the country — as the talking point du jour and, for both Attorney General J.B. McCuskey and Gov. Patrick Morrisey, it is politically advantageous to endear themselves to the MAGA wing of the party. This means that, in these men’s quest for power and influence, girls like Becky may become collateral damage.
I know what it feels like to be the girl in the middle of a conservative scheme to grab power. I grew up in Elkview, West Virginia, and attended George Washington High School (where, incidentally, I competed on the cross country team). In 2013, when I spoke out about my high school principal George Aulenbacher’s decision to bring the faith-based abstinence-only sex education speaker Pam Stenzel to campus, I survived a similar coordinated attempt to harass and discredit me.
In my case, what might have seemed like mild and block-cureable online posting did actually have real life consequences. At the height of the controversy, I was regularly physically menaced in public, received unmarked harassing mail to my family’s home, and was a constant target of threats and more general bullying online, all of which was accelerated by a few agitators who created an online funnel to send angry adults as well as some of my own peers my way. This experience has had long-lasting impacts on my mental health as well as my relationship to my hometown in West Virginia. What has stuck with me most from that time was the cruelty of adults who were able to look past my being a child and transform me into some kind of abstract left wing villain because I simply spoke out in defense of myself and other girls.
Becky Pepper-Jackson is not a villain. She is a high school sophomore who should be getting to focus on studying for her learner’s permit and hanging out with her friends at practice but is instead being forced to be very brave in the face of a nationwide movement that seeks to enshrine discrimination against her and girls like her. West Virginians shouldn’t fall for McCuskey and Morrisey’s bullying bait. Let kids be kids and let Becky play.

Colorado is the sixth-least affordable state for child care in the nation. Costs for center-based care average 14% of a two-parent household’s median income and 45% of a single parent’s median income. The federal affordability benchmark is just 7%.
Colorado also faces significant shortages in access to slots in licensed child care programs. In 2023, more than 40,000 Colorado parents reported quitting a job, turning down a job or significantly changing a job because of problems with child care.
Recently, several Colorado counties passed measures to subsidize child care through local taxes. Despite these advancements, Colorado’s child care system is facing a fiscal crisis that is likely to affect families and children for years to come.
Child care disruptions for families with infants and toddlers are estimated to cost the state more than $2.7 billion in lost economic productivity and revenue. Ensuring access to affordable child care supports workforce participation and enhances the well-being of children and families.

I study early care and education policies and programs that promote children’s cognitive, behavioral and social-emotional learning. My research lab at Colorado State University has been investigating the consequences of a lack of access to high-quality, affordable child care on child and family outcomes.
Colorado’s Child Care Assistance Program
Since the late 1990s, the Colorado Child Care Assistance Program has subsidized the cost of child care for parents and caregivers with lower incomes who are working, searching for work or pursuing education. My research shows these subsidies are a critical lifeline that help lower-income families access child care.
Subsidies allow families to prioritize factors other than cost, such as location, in their search for child care. From 2023 to 2024, the Colorado subsidy program served more than 30,000 children in the state. That’s about 10% of those who qualified, which is typical for most states.
A federal March 2024 rule from the Administration for Children and Families caps family co-payments at no more than 7% of household income. It also requires reimbursement rates to reflect the full cost of care, whereas previously subsidy payments were based on what families could afford to pay.
Although intended to improve affordability for families and adequately compensate child care programs, the rule included no additional federal funding. In Colorado, meeting these new requirements is projected to cost the subsidy system approximately $43 million more per year.
These changes, combined with the expiration of COVID-19 relief funding that provided Colorado an additional $465 million to stabilize and expand child care assistance, has created growing financial instability for the subsidy system.
Approximately one-third of Colorado counties are experiencing an enrollment freeze for their child care subsidies. This means new applicants cannot access subsidized care until the freeze is lifted. There is no set timeline for when that will occur.
Without additional funding that would allow the freeze to be lifted, enrollment in Colorado’s Child Care Assistance Program is estimated to decline by 64%, falling from about 30,000 to just 10,000 enrollees. As children age out or families no longer qualify, spots that would normally open up for new enrollees will remain unfilled during the freeze.
Zooming in on Larimer County
I have been studying the impacts of the enrollment freeze in my hometown of Larimer County, Colorado. It’s a geographically diverse region that includes urban centers such as Fort Collins and Loveland, mountain destinations such as Estes Park, and rural agricultural communities. Like elsewhere in the state, child care costs pose a significant financial strain on local families.
A household in Larimer County with a median income of $64,919 and two children under the age of 5 spends approximately 37% of its income on child care. Due to budget constraints, Larimer County has had an enrollment freeze in the Colorado Child Care Assistance Program since February of 2024. The county has effectively paused the intake of new applicants for subsidies.
Recently, we administered surveys to 88 families in Larimer County. Approximately half of those surveyed were currently receiving a subsidy and half had applied but were unable to access it because of the freeze. We compared families using advanced statistical modeling that controlled for any differences between groups, allowing us to isolate the effects of the subsidy freeze on family outcomes.
In unpublished research that is being prepared for peer review, we found families affected by the freeze used fewer paid child care hours, faced higher costs, expressed greater concerns about costs, and reported more difficulty paying for care. They also had less reliable and stable arrangements, were less satisfied with their care, experienced higher child care-related stress and displayed greater risk of depression.
But that’s not all. Families without a subsidy reported missing twice as many workdays. When extrapolated across the 425 families in Larimer County affected by the freeze, this translated to over $2.2 million in lost annual earnings.
Local initiatives driving solutions
Recognizing the gaps in affordable child care, counties across Colorado introduced ballot measures to fund local solutions through tax revenue.
These measures come after the state established a universal preschool program in 2022. The following year, the program provided up to 15 hours per week of tuition-free, high-quality preschool for more than 85,000 children.
Measures in Larimer, San Miguel, Garfield, Pitkin and southwest Eagle counties will directly fund child care through sales or property taxes. Measures in Gilpin, Hinsdale, Ouray and Eagle counties will generate funds through lodging taxes.
In Larimer, voters passed a measure that established an additional countywide sales tax of 0.25%, or 25 cents per 100 dollars. The measure is expected to generate $28 million annually for child care assistance and workforce compensation.
In San Miguel, voters passed an existing property tax of 75 cents for every 1,000 dollars of assessed property value, allowing the county to collect and use all the revenue it generates instead of being limited by a new state cap. This will allow the county to retain nearly $1 million annually to support local child care affordability.
In Eagle County, voters passed a measure approving a lodging tax increase from 2% to 4% on hotel stays and short-term rentals that will raise approximately $4.5 million annually to lower child care costs.
Revenue from these initiatives will provide child care tuition to families, expand child care slots, support quality improvement and raise wages for child care workers.
These local investments cannot by themselves resolve Colorado’s statewide child care funding deficit, but they have the potential to transform access and quality within communities where they are implemented.
Colorado is not alone in these issues. Many other states are facing subsidy enrollment freezes and are exploring regional solutions to stabilize funding.
For example, ballot measures in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Seattle, Washington, also recently passed, providing reliable funding for child care assistance, preschool quality and workforce compensation.
With the uncertainty of the state and federal funding landscape, municipalities across the country may look to Colorado as a model for locally driven strategies that address community needs.

How involved might the president get?,Geoff Pender and Taylor Vance,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/14/trump-mississippi-school-choice/,"President Donald Trump speaks during a rally at BancorpSouth Arena in Tupelo, Miss., Friday, November 1, 2019.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Faced with internecine Republican opposition to “school-choice,” or spending tax dollars earmarked for public education on private schools, House Speaker Jason White broke out the biggest gun in Mississippi GOP politics: He invoked President Donald J. Trump.
“The @WhiteHouse is watching Mississippi and Education Freedom is gaining momentum!” White posted Monday on the social media site X. “HB 2 promotes the Make America Great Again Platform and @POTUS’s Executive Order to return power over education to families, instead of bureaucracies …”
White had retweeted a post from Trump Education Secretary Linda McMahon, endorsing the House’s proposed HB 2 as “ambitious school choice expansion” and adding, “Well done, @JasonWhiteMS.”
A key question that remains unanswered, though, is how far the Trump White House is willing to go to see a robust school-choice policy become reality in the Magnolia State, which remains a holdout in the Deep South.
A White House official who was granted anonymity to speak candidly about the situation told Mississippi Today that the Trump administration is “very closely monitoring” the school choice debate in the Legislature and wants strong school choice legislation to pass.
U.S. Department of Education officials traveled to Mississippi last year to visit with White’s staff and Gov. Tate Reeves’ office to discuss policy specifics.
Now, many took White’s trumpeting Trump’s support for his plan as a shot over the bow of his Republican Senate leadership colleagues, including Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann. Senate leaders have vowed they will not consider any House proposal that includes vouchers or accounts for parents to spend public money on private schooling.
White and other proponents of expanded school choice and spending public money on private schooling appear to be trying to cast the issue as a referendum on Trump. And among the MSGOP, when Trump says jump, the answer appears to be, “How high?”
But with a House committee vote on White’s school-choice proposal happening as early as Wednesday, it would appear that his invocation of Trump was as much an effort to whip votes from his own still-reluctant or opposed House members as it was to try to sway the Senate. Some heavy-duty House whipping of Republican votes on school choice has been going on even before the Legislature gaveled in for the new session last week. Reluctance and opposition remain among some House Republicans.
Senate leaders, including Hosemann, appeared nonplussed by White’s warning that Trump is watching or by McMahon’s endorsement. When asked about McMahon’s backing of House Bill 2 on Supertalk radio this week, Hosemann replied that he’s surprised she’s read it all, a dig at the 553-page omnibus House education proposal that includes school choice vouchers.
Trump has endorsed school choice and included federal tax credits for donations to fund private school scholarships in his so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill.” He’s called school choice “the civil rights issue of our time.”
But how involved would Trump and his administration get in Mississippi’s legislative wrangling over school choice? Might he come down for a visit to whip up votes? Might he or Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller start calling Mississippi GOP lawmakers and threaten to primary them next year, as the Capitol rumor mill was suggesting this week?
Trump appears to have many bigger fish to fry at the moment. He famously doesn’t like to lose battles, especially when he parachutes in on the state or local levels. Senate leaders have deemed spending tax dollars on private schools a non-starter. Local governments, including in some red areas, have adopted resolutions against school choice expansion, and local superintendents across the state are lobbying their lawmakers against it.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)On the eve of the 2026 General Assembly session, Senate Democrats on Tuesday rolled out an ambitious agenda centered on lowering the financial strain on Virginia families, while signalling openness to revisiting tax and revenue policy amid looming budget pressures. 
Democrats control both chambers of the legislature, which is set to convene Wednesday with affordability at the forefront of lawmakers’ priorities, amid broader economic and policy debates facing the commonwealth.
At a news conference in Richmond, party leaders outlined what they called the “2026 affordability agenda,” a package aimed at easing costs for households across sectors including healthcare, childcare, housing, energy and food access. 
The framework builds on the Affordable Virginia blueprint unveiled last month by Democratic Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger, who has made cost-of-living issues a central theme of her early legislative push.
“Over the course of the last year, one of the things that we kept hearing about was the rising costs among families,” said Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, chair of the Senate Democratic Caucus. 
“Families across Virginia are being squeezed by rising costs from housing and health care to childcare and everyday necessities, and they deserve relief. The urgency of this moment is not lost on us.”
Locke said the agenda will rest on eight pillars that also include transportation, job and food access, energy and education, aimed at restoring “hope, freedom and opportunity for working families” in Virginia.
Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, tied the affordability push directly to economic pressures he attributes to federal policy shifts, including tariffs and energy costs. 
In a sweeping critique of national trends, Surovell said rising prices for essentials such as food and utilities underscore the urgency of the legislature’s work.
“The truth is, President Trump’s policies are failing Virginians, and the question now is whether we’re going to let that happen, whether we’re going to do something about it,” Surovell said, previewing a slate of Democratic proposals that would raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2028, create paid family medical leave and expand collective bargaining rights for public employees.
Surovell also addressed the state’s fiscal outlook, noting that new federal tax law changes — part of the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill passed by Congress last year — could cost Virginia roughly $1 billion in revenue if the commonwealth conforms its tax code to the federal structure. 
The legislature must decide within the first two weeks of session whether to align state tax policy with the federal changes, he said.
“If we can form our tax policy to what Congress asks us to do, it costs us a $1 billion of revenue,” Surovell said. “We’re going to have to make a decision in the first two weeks whether or not we can conform to the federal tax law or not.” 
He added that after adjustments for K-12 and Medicaid spending, Virginia is facing a $3 billion to $4 billion funding gap before new initiatives can be considered.
Among potential revenue discussions are modernizing elements of the state’s tax structure, Surovell said, including reexamining the sales tax base and whether existing income tax brackets are equitable in a changing economy.
Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, the Senate’s president pro tempore, echoed the centrality of affordability while placing it in the broader context of opportunity and long-term prosperity. 
“We’re going to frame affordability and (it’s) inseparable from freedom and opportunity,” Lucas said, naming access to quality education, health care and workforce development as key components of sustainable economic mobility.
The Democratic agenda dovetails with wider General Assembly expectations.
Affordability resonated with voters across Virginia in the 2025 elections, helping deliver Democratic a sharp increase of the party’s House majority and shaping policy priorities for 2026. 
Spanberger’s earlier rollout of the Affordable Virginia Agenda mirrored her campaign promises and framed the session as an opportunity to tackle prescription drug costs, utility bills and housing challenges, with a focus on measures to restrain runaway costs without overburdening the state budget.
Still, the ambitious scope of Democratic proposals has drawn scrutiny from critics who argue that some measures — such as broad regulatory changes and spending mandates — could backfire by shifting costs elsewhere in the economy or increasing burdens on businesses and ratepayers. 
A recent Washington Post analysis suggested that certain affordability strategies may inadvertently raise costs through cross-subsidization or expanded mandates.
Beyond affordability, Democrats and Republicans alike are preparing for debate on other high-profile issues such as constitutional amendments, redistricting procedures and structural reforms in areas like energy policy and worker protections. 
Under Virginia’s Constitution, constitutional amendments that passed for the first time last year must be approved again in the coming weeks before moving to voters later in 2026, making this session particularly consequential.

(Photo by Imaginima/Getty Images)Virginia’s ever-growing fleet of data centers will take the spotlight when the General Assembly reconvenes this week. Along with bills addressing issues like energy use and siting, legislators will need to address a problem that received little attention in previous years: the diesel generators that provide backup power in emergencies.
In Northern Virginia, where most data centers are concentrated, millions of people are exposed to air pollution from thousands of massive diesel generators. Air toxins permeate the surrounding area every time these generators are run for routine testing and maintenance, with greater levels of pollution when they all kick on at once in a grid emergency. As more data centers go up in suburban neighborhoods and close to schools, residents fear that their health, and that of their children, is being sacrificed to Big Tech’s AI ambitions. 
Ongoing research led by Dr. Damian Pitt at Virginia Commonwealth University, using data from the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), shows pollution from data centers currently makes up a very small but growing percentage of the region’s most harmful air emissions, including CO, NOx and PM2.5. (In pollution, the automobile is still king.)  Already the appendix to the report, using 2023 data, shows significant impacts to neighborhoods around data centers in Loudoun and Prince William counties, exceeding emissions from other high-pollution facilities in the region. 
(Map courtesy Damien Pitt/Virginia Commonwealth University research team)
But as the research team noted, the total allowable emissions under DEQ permits is far greater, and this also keeps growing with construction of each new data center. 
And those are annual limits, which could be met with very high emissions on a limited number of days. It’s not hard to imagine the health crisis that might accompany a grid emergency causing all of the area’s generators to fire up at once on a hot summer day, perhaps when smoke from wildfires is already pushing air quality into the hazard zone. 
Yet the problem grows with every new data center that’s built, each one requiring backup power on site. In Virginia, diesel is the fuel of choice, most of it burned in so-called Tier II emergency generators with no pollution controls. 
In the past year, large operators have started installing Tier IV generators in addition to Tier II generators. The Tier IV have some pollution controls and are not restricted to emergency use. They are subject to the same annual emissions limits, but as long as they stay under the permitted level there is no limit on how much they can run. 
The new trend suggests that operators who install these non-emergency generators either think their Tier II generators may be used so much in the future that it will put the data center at risk of exceeding the permit’s annual air pollution limits – which would be bad – or they intend to use the Tier IV generators outside of emergency situations – which might be worse. 
Either way, it appears operators expect to burn a lot more diesel fuel in coming years. One Amazon permit I reviewed contemplates a single data center using up to ten million gallons of diesel fuel annually for 173 generators. All that diesel fuel is delivered by diesel trucks, which adds to the region’s pollution but isn’t limited by the permits.
Why so much? DEQ guidance from January 2025 indicates that data centers have two to three levels of redundancy in their generator capacity – that is, backups for the backups, so operators never have to fear losing power if some of the generators won’t start. As a result, there is more generator capacity than data center load. Together, Northern Virginia’s 4,000-plus diesel generators add up to over 11 gigawatts of energy capacity – exceeding Dominion Energy’s entire natural gas fleet, and enough to power millions of homes. 
But of course, they don’t power millions of homes. They are used only for data centers, and when all goes well, they aren’t used at all. These thousands of generators just sit around doing nothing.  
Apparently, this is the cheapest possible way to ensure data centers never lose power, but it’s hard to believe they can’t do better. If there is redundancy anyway, data centers ought to be using batteries or other storage as their first line of defense in an outage, reserving Tier IV for second-line backup and eliminating Tier II generators altogether. Typical lithium-ion batteries provide four hours of electricity, enough to cover most backup needs and still leaving room to help the grid meet peaks in demand. 
A (very) few operators are in fact doing this, but unless Virginia acts to require it, Big Tech has little incentive to prioritize clean backup power. The use of diesel generators offloads the true cost of backup power onto residents in the region, who pay in the form of worse health outcomes and a lower quality of life. Evidently that suits the tech companies just fine. 
While residents demand an end to the pollution, Virginia’s government has been going in exactly the opposite direction. This fall, DEQ amended a guidance document to allow Tier II generators to run more often. DEQ achieved this by changing the definition of “emergency” to include planned power outages, such as might occur when a utility schedules work on a substation that supplies electricity to a data center. 
DEQ cut some legally-questionable corners to get this change finalized two weeks before the end of Glenn Youngkin’s term as governor. When word got out, more than 500 people submitted comments online and by email, overwhelmingly opposed to easing generator restrictions. Only a small handful of commenters supported the change, mainly the data centers themselves and a couple of their chamber of commerce allies. 
DEQ didn’t respond to ordinary residents, but the letter it mailed to what seems to have been a select few commenters was unrepentant. DEQ did not even acknowledge the suggestions that it require batteries instead of allowing the increased use of the dirtiest diesel generators.
Pressure will now be on the General Assembly to tackle the issue. This session will likely see the reintroduction of legislation offered in 2024 and 2025 by Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, and Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, limiting or banning the use of diesel generators at data centers as part of larger bills addressing their energy use.
And this year a new Loudoun County Democrat, Del. John McAuliff, has introduced legislation requiring data centers to use storage as the first line of defense in emergencies, limiting Tier IV generators to emergency use when storage is exhausted, and removing the option of Tier II generators altogether. The bill also adds air monitoring and public notification requirements.
No doubt the data center lobby will resist these measures, as they have absolutely every initiative that would require them to shoulder the cost of their presence in Virginia. Their allies in the General Assembly will fret that requiring Amazon to prioritize cleaner alternatives to diesel generators might raise costs incrementally for a multinational company and its billionaire chief. 
That feels increasingly out of touch. In November a Virginia government report calculated that the data center industry received more than $2.7 billion in incentives over the past decade, thanks to Virginia taxpayers. 
It shouldn’t be any surprise that now the taxpayers would like a little consideration in return.

Wes Moore enters the legislative session that starts Wednesday — the last of his first term — facing a number of challenges but confident, and focused on the tasks that still need to be accomplished this year before the campaign begins in earnest.","Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) talks about the challneges of the 2026 legislative session during an interview in his office on Monday. (Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)The 2026 General Assembly session was supposed to be a quiet one, after a 2025 session when lawmakers closed a $3.3 billion budget gap with a combination of one-time fund transfers, program cuts and $1.6 billion in tax increases.
Instead, Gov. Wes Moore (D) enters the legislative session that starts Wednesday — the last session of his first term — facing a number of challenges before his reelection campaign begins in earnest.
There’s a projected $1.5 billion budget deficit, the likely loss of federal jobs and federal funding as a result of Trump administration policies, tepid relations with lawmakers, a potential showdown over redistricting and ongoing threats to funding to replace the Francis Scott Key Bridge.
But in the days leading up to the session, Moore has methodically rolled out his legislative priorities in a series of press conferences, on housing, education, crime prevention, economic development, health care and more.
When asked in a a wide-ranging interview Monday what signature initiative was a must-have for the last session of the term, the governor would only say there is “a lot that needs to be accomplished.”
“And I know that’s why I’m asking for a second term. There’s more work to be done,” he said. “I think the people of this state will know that I’ve kept my promises.
Ferguson enters ‘third chapter’ with a new speaker and old budget problems

“That when I said that we’re going to focus on creating pathways to work, wages and wealth, that we’ve been able to get more people into the workforce. That we’ve been able to quadruple the amount of people in apprenticeship and trade platforms,” he said. “We signed the largest mass pardon in the history of the United States of America to get more people employed. We went from 43rd in the country in unemployment to, at one point, literally having the lowest unemployment rate in the entire country.”
Despite that, he enters his fourth legislative session with slowly declining public approval.
Moore, the first Black man elected governor in Maryland and just the third nationally, entered office with approval ratings at or above 60%. Since 2024, those numbers have declined in polls by organizations including the Institute of Politics at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and the Annapolis-based Gonzales Poll. In a Gonzales poll released Tuesday, Moore’s overall approval rating was about 52%, but the gap between his approval and disapproval numbers is now 11 points, down from a robust 35 points earlier.
“I’m not a person who spends my time looking at poll numbers,” Moore said Tuesday. “I really like to spend time on things that actually matter to the people of our state, making sure we can make our state safer, making sure we can continue the historic drops in violent crime … that’s what I focus my time on.”
Inside the State House, Moore faces potentially cooler relations with lawmakers of his own party.
During a December special session, the Democratic super-majority legislature overrode more than a dozen bills vetoed by Moore including a bill to create a commission on reparations. Around the same time, he angered many lawmakers in his party by  announcing a campaign slate that could back primary challengers for those not seen as supportive enough of the governor’s agenda.
One item likely to test State House relations is the proposal to redraw the state’s congressional districts, to counter Republican states that have redistricted to gain partisan advantage in hopes of retaining control of Congress in 2026. Moore and House leaders support the move, but the Senate appears dead-set against it.
Moore in November created a five-member advisory commission to study the current state maps for fairness — though he has never defined the term — and make a recommendation. The panel meets Friday and could potentially recommend a map to the legislature.

Moore said any legislation will come from the General Assembly, not from his office.
“This is not an administration bill,” he said Monday. “I’ve been clear about where my priorities are, but I’ve also been clear that it’s never the wrong time to fight for democracy.
“Once the commission makes the recommendations, they’ll send it to the Maryland General Assembly and then it’ll be in the hands of” lawmakers, he said.
That fight could pale, however, in the face of the newest budget deficit.
Moore and legislature leaders appear to agree that no additional taxes are likely this year.
Moore promised his upcoming budget will include a general fund proposal that is lower than the one in the current year budget.
Last year, Moore proposed a total budget of $63.7 billion — a 1% increase over the previous year, but that included a $27 billion general fund budget that was 1% smaller.
“I think that there are certain themes that people will be able to see from from this budget. One is, this is going to be the fourth budget in a row that I’ve introduced that’s not just a balanced budget, but that we are going to decrease the size of the general fund,” he said.
Moore did not elaborate on the size of the decrease, but another 1% reduction in the general fund would be a cut of about $270 million, or less than one-fifth of the projected fiscal 2027 deficit.
The governor said that while last year’s budget reflected “some of the greatest fears we had from the Trump-Vance administration,” this year’s budget will “reflect the greatest realities” of federal policy under President Donald Trump (R). Among those, the loss of 25,000 federal jobs in the state between January and November.
“We’re 25,000 a year in, OK? We’re a year in and I think that this is an administration that has shown they do not have respect for federal workers,” Moore said. “They don’t have respect for government. Their idea of fixing government is setting it on fire.”
And Moore said he expects more hits to come this year from an administration that “telegraphs their punches.”

“They have been telegraphing their punches from Inauguration Day, and they’ve been telegraphing the fact that that this assault on Maryland, this assault on our most vulnerable, this assault on our communities of color — they have been very clear about what they’re going to do, and they have given no indication that they are done,” Moore said. “In fact, the only indication we’ve gotten is that they’re just getting started.”
The state is also expecting federal funding to replace the Francis Scott Key Bridge. But costs have grown from a rough estimate of $1.7 billion in the days immediately following the collapse to about $5.2 billion today.
U.S Transportation Department Secretary Sean Duffy has been critical of aspects of the project, raising concerns among some that the federal goverment will not come through with the 100% replacement costs approved by Congress under President Joseph Biden. Moore, who is scheduled to meet Thursday with Duffy, dismisses that threat.
“This is the fastest moving large project in the country,” Moore said, adding he was willing to work with the president and the federal government to move the project forward.
“This is America’s bridge when you think about its importance to the Port of Baltimore and its importance to commerce as a whole,” he said. “And so I’m looking forward to sitting down with the secretary to continue not just to make our case, but continue to show him, or just remind him, why Congress already had full faith in the work that we’re doing.”
The governor sidestepped questions about a contingency plan, should federal funding falter, saying he would continue to work with federal lawmakers if necessary.
“I’m just grateful that Congress provided the authorization, and we’re continuing to look forward to working with Congress to ensure that that stays stable,” Moore said.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)An award of $202 million has been announced for Ohio to combat hospital closures and a lack of access to health care in rural areas. The funding was welcomed by state leaders and advocates alike, but the funds are seen as a temporary fix to a problem made worse by federal cuts.
The five-year Rural Health Transformation Program — authorized under Republican lawmakers’ mega tax and spending cut package Trump signed into law in 2025 — is designed to offset the budget impacts on rural areas due to sweeping Medicaid cuts.
In Ohio, the Medicaid cuts from the federal spending bill amount to a loss of $33 billion over the next decade, according to an analysis by the healthy policy organization KFF.
A total of $50 billion is being spread out nationally through the Rural Health Transformation Program.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said the state was “grateful to be awarded this funding so that more Ohioans can receive expanded access and enhanced quality to necessary health care.”
Republican state Rep. Kellie Deeter, co-chair of the Ohio House Rural Hospital Caucus, said Ohio’s award is “consistent with the proposal submitted by the state, so this announcement largely reflects what was anticipated.”
“However, it is still not enough to offset broader federal cuts and therefore will not meaningfully help our rural hospitals,” Deeter said.
“The focus now should be on how these dollars are deployed to deliver real, sustainable improvements in rural health care — particularly for rural hospitals that lack access to certain publicly funded revenue streams.”
Alaska, Montana, Oklahoma crack top five in first rural hospital funding allocation

Democratic state Rep. Anita Somani had a similar critique, saying the funding was appreciated, but was “equivalent to treating a severed artery with a bandage.”
“These funds will not stop the bleeding caused by other federal cuts, and any attempt to imply otherwise is misleading,” Somani said.
The governor’s office said the state proposal focused on addressing barriers to health in those rural parts of the state, like access to specialty care, lowered health outcomes, and higher rates of chronic disease.
The money will be used to invest in school-based health centers in rural communities, expanding the state’s child vision care program called OhioSEE to rural communities, and further addressing Ohio’s infant mortality rate, according to DeWine’s office.
The state included costs in its proposal for the funding, estimating the program and initiative cost to be between $181.8 million and $252 million.
‘Pressing health care and socioeconomic needs’
In a “project narrative” compiled by the Ohio Department of Health as part of the application for the funding, state data showed 4.4 million Ohioans live in 73 counties that have the designation of fully rural or have a “significant rural footprint.”
The narrative mentions Ohio’s 74,000 farms and the more than 200 commodities grown in the state, including corn, soybeans, dairy, hogs, and poultry.
Rural counties also support manufacturing and forestry, along with tourism and recreation.
The Appalachian counties received a particular mention for “resource extraction,” a blanket term used when referring to fossil fuel drilling, timber collection, and other similar sectors.
“For many rural Ohioans, the land isn’t just scenery, it is livelihood,” the document stated.
The application documents from the state also lay out the challenges rural communities face when it comes to health care access, infrastructure support, income, housing, education and access to healthy foods.
“The story is consistent, rural Ohioans have strong ties to land and community, but also pressing health care and socioeconomic needs,” according to the state’s application.
Source: Ohio Department of Health
A “chronic disease atlas” released by the state last summer found significant differences in health status and outcomes based on the region of Ohio in which those suffering from chronic disease live.
The research found chronic disease was more common in the southern counties of the state,  including and in addition to the 32 counties of the Appalachian region.
Chronic diseases noted in the area were arthritis, asthma, chronic kidney disease, coronary heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
“High mortality rates for all chronic diseases combined, Alzheimer’s Disease, cancer, and chronic lower respiratory disease are also concentrated in southern counties,” the report stated.
Rural, non-Appalachian counties had high instances of diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, heart disease, and Parkinson’s Disease as well.
Those prevalence rates combine with a lack of regular visits to physicians, physical activity, health insurance, and insecurity when it comes to food and transportation, according to the state.
Ohio’s rural counties have 57 hospitals, with 33 categorized as critical access hospitals.
The designation was created by Congress decades ago, as hundreds of rural hospitals faced closure in the 1980s and 1990s.
According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, hospitals are eligible to become critical access if they are currently participating in Medicare, or are health clinics or centers that downsized from acting as hospitals.

Medicare-participating hospitals can become critical access hospitals if they are in a rural area, are more than 35 miles from the nearest hospital, have no more than 25 inpatient beds and have an average length of stay of less than 96 hours per patient.
Rural health was struggling before the newest federal budget bill was signed into law last July, but Medicaid cuts and new rules in that budget had hospitals bracing for even more challenges and the potential for closures.
Since 2010, three rural hospitals have closed and the state said 10 more were at risk of closure.
“As of 2023, one in four rural hospitals in Ohio operated at a financial loss, and 18% were considered vulnerable for closure,” the state’s Rural Health Transformation Fund project narrative stated.
Doctors and advocates seeing the looming threat to rural health facilities feared for emergency and daily care of course, but the impact on an already fading number of maternity wards could also mean hard times for rural communities.
But only a small part of the funding states receive from the rural health fund – no more than 15% — can be used for direct payments to facilities like hospitals and clinics, according to an analysis by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
The rules for how the money can be used “could substantially limit how states are able to allocate awarded funding,” the foundation analysis stated.
Plus, the fund is meant to offset funding cuts to rural health, but it doesn’t match the rate at which the country’s rural hospitals and clinics are losing funding because of the federal budget bill.
“The fund doesn’t offset the cuts (to Medicaid funding and rural communities),” the foundation stated. “$50 billion (nationwide) for rural health is modest compared to the $137 billion in cuts to rural communities and nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid funding cuts.

Experts are watching the case, which could impact abortion access across the Midwest and South. (Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The outcome of a trial over Missouri’s abortion regulations could ripple far beyond the state, potentially creating new availability for women in the Midwest and South who can’t access abortion close to home.
As a judge weighs the constitutionality of a litany of state restrictions on abortion, the stakes are clear for Missouri women: The decision could hamper access for nearly everyone in the state — or greatly broaden it in ways not seen in decades. That would allow women in a dozen nearby states with abortion bans to travel a shorter distance to access the procedure.
“Opening and reestablishing rights in the state of Missouri would help to alleviate some of the pressure that other states have since so many Southern states have banned abortion,” said Julie Burkhart, the co-owner of Hope Clinic in Granite City, Illinois. “It just seems logical that we would see a shift in migration patterns of patients in the country.”
At her clinic, about a 15-minute drive from downtown St. Louis, Missourians account for about half of all patients, Burkhart said. Though Missouri voters in 2024 enshrined a right to abortion in the state constitution, access has remained highly limited because of restrictive state laws. Only procedural abortions are available on a limited basis across three Planned Parenthood clinics in the state.
Many of those state laws face legal scrutiny this week as a Missouri judge weighs the constitutionality of regulations targeting abortion providers. Those include a 72-hour waiting period between initial appointments and procedures, mandatory pelvic exams for medication abortions and a ban on telemedicine appointments for medication abortions.











It just seems logical that we would see a shift in migration patterns of patients in the country.


– Julie Burkhart, co-owner of Hope Clinic in Granite City, Ill., which provides abortion service to many out-of-state patients



Planned Parenthood affiliates in Missouri argue state restrictions are unconstitutional under 2024’s voter-approved constitutional amendment. Over decades, state restrictions have gutted Missouri’s provider networks, limited appointment availability and ultimately forced abortions to a halt in 2022, before a limited number resumed after the 2024 vote.
Experts and advocates are closely monitoring the Missouri case, which is expected to be appealed regardless of the outcome, because of its practical implications on access in the region. While many women now rely on abortion medication, procedural abortion is still crucial for those seeking later-term abortions or who prefer an in-clinic procedure.
But the two-week bench trial in downtown Kansas City also tests lawmakers’ ability to put in place rules so restrictive that they effectively ban abortion — a practice used by anti-abortion lawmakers in other states looking to limit access to the procedure.
“Judges do not operate in a vacuum,” Burkhart said, “ … and we know for a fact that judges look outside the borders of their state for information and for guidance. I do see this as having national importance.”
That’s especially true in other states also litigating abortion access, including Arizona, Michigan and Ohio, said Rebecca Reingold, an associate director at Georgetown University’s O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law.
While state judges are not bound by the decisions of judges in other states, their deliberations can be informed by court rulings, particularly involving novel legal questions or areas of the law that are evolving.
“There is little doubt that advocates and decision-makers in other states navigating similar legal challenges are closely monitoring the litigation over Missouri’s abortion regulations,” Reingold said.
Restrictions targeting abortion
In the first days of the trial, Planned Parenthood leaders argued that ever-changing state laws and agency regulations have drastically limited access, caused needless red tape and posed privacy risk for their patients.
Dr. Margaret Baum, chief medical officer with St. Louis-based Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, said the Missouri requirements specifically target abortion rather than all other kinds of medical care.
“I provide vasectomies routinely. … And I am not required to have a complication plan, contact a primary care physician, even ask the patient how many miles they live from the health center.”
Opening day of Missouri abortion-rights trial focuses on decades of state restrictions

Baum said state-mandated reporting rules unique to abortion require clinicians to ask the race, education level, marital status and specific location of each patient — none of which is relevant to their care.
Planned Parenthood Great Rivers would like to offer abortion services in Springfield, Baum testified. Access in that region would provide an option for rural Missourians, and also could help serve residents in nearby Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas, where abortion is almost universally banned.
But the organization’s facilities there do not meet state abortion regulations for physical attributes, including hallway size, doorway size and the number of recliners in recovery rooms, Baum testified.
Lawyers for the state defended Missouri’s restrictions as commonsense safeguards aimed at protecting vulnerable women. The attorney general’s office argued that complication risks of abortion justify additional state regulation — despite professional medical associations saying it’s generally safe. The AG’s office also maintained that Planned Parenthood faced a conflict of interest because of its financial motivations.
“Abortion is a business,” Deputy Solicitor General Peter Donohue said during a procedural argument on Monday. “Your Honor, the plaintiffs are asking to deregulate their profession in order to make more money.”
The state was expected to call as witnesses anti-abortion doctors and activists later in the trial.
Patients traveling for care
Since the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling that overturned federal constitutional protections for abortion in June 2022, the number of abortions has increased slightly across the country, according to the health research nonprofit KFF.
The group points to expanded telehealth, which can offer medication abortion more affordably through virtual appointments.
Women in states with abortion bans are the biggest users of abortion telemedicine

Since the 2022 ruling and subsequent state abortion bans, patients have experienced higher travel costs for abortions and delays in care, according to research published in the American Journal of Public Health in July.
Researchers from the University of California, San Francisco found that travel time to access abortion increased from 2.8 hours to 11.3 hours for residents in states with abortion bans. Travel costs increased from $179 to $372. And more than half of survey respondents said their abortion care required an overnight hotel stay, compared with 5% before an abortion ban.
In 2024, an estimated 7,880 Missourians traveled to Illinois and 3,960 traveled to Kansas to access abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on advancing reproductive rights.
Those Missourians were among the approximate 155,000 people who crossed state lines to access abortion care that year, representing 15% of all abortions provided in states without total bans.
Ongoing uncertainty
Regardless of its outcome, the Missouri case is expected to be appealed. Even if the plaintiffs are ultimately successful, it may take a long time to restore care networks across the state, said Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a data scientist at the Guttmacher Institute.
“And that’s particularly the case when there are states that have a lot of legal uncertainty or restrictions coming into effect and then coming out of effect,” he said. “It’s not quick to open up a clinic. It’s not quick to even necessarily expand the kinds of services, or the kinds of the number of people that a clinic can see.”
Kimya Forouzan, the organization’s principal state policy adviser, said Missouri’s landscape is evidence that lawmakers can drastically curb abortion access without total bans. And despite an overwhelming vote to amend the constitution, legal battles can follow.
Even if the state’s laws are found unconstitutional, Forouzan said, lawmakers will likely still push anti-abortion measures. She noted that several bills have already been introduced in this year’s just-convened legislative session, and that Republican lawmakers are pushing a ballot measure to repeal 2024’s reproductive rights amendment.
“There’s very much a push to pass as many restrictions as possible and kind of see what happens later and how things shape up later. … Time will tell, but we do know that they’re still pushing forth restrictions,” she said.

(Getty Images)On Dec. 31, 2025, two decades of federal tax benefits for homeowners who install solar electric systems came to an end. Originally created in 2005 by Congress, the program provided for a tax credit (meaning the amount was directly subtracted from a homeowner’s federal tax bill) of 30% of the amount one invested in the installation of solar panels and the associated technology to connect them to the grid. For those who had the money to invest (or could borrow it easily) it was a tax benefit to middle class people like me. 
Admittedly, when we installed our first array of panels in 2009, the cost was such that even with the tax credit, and installing them ourselves (with the help of a brother-in-law electrical engineer) the payback stretched out 15 years. Eight years later, when the price of the panels had dropped by more than 50%, we put in another array on a second pole, out in the field in front of our house. (Putting them on the roof was impractical because of some beautiful shade trees that keep the house cooler in the summer.) Both times we essentially got a tax cut that eliminated our income tax liability for that year.
Going solar cut our summer electric bill to a negligible level, often under $30 per month. It also gave us the incentive to install a heat pump hot water heater when our gas heater died, and a “mini-split” heat pump as a back-up space heater. Being one of those frugal Yankees, since we built it in 1981 I’ve been heating the house mostly with firewood I cut here on the farm and the solar energy that comes through the windows and greenhouse on the south side of the house.  But going away to visit family in the winter required a more technologically sophisticated system, thus the heat pump. Both the water heater and mini-split qualified for energy conservation tax credits at that time. The mini-split cost a lot less to install than an oil or gas system.
All this, plus gradually converting all the lighting to LEDs, means our electric bill hasn’t really gone up despite our greater use of electricity. So now, in retirement, we have a house we can afford to keep comfortable without worry about the price of oil, gas, or the inevitable increases in the price of kilowatt hours.
But there was more we could do. After Congress decided in July to end the renewable energy tax credits, we contacted an installer about a battery backup. Out here in our rural neighborhood, near the end of the power lines, we experience outages often enough that either a generator or battery is necessary. The battery qualified for the 30% tax credits, so we opted for that, knowing it would have to be installed by Dec. 31.
Here we are in January, and no battery. Not because our installer couldn’t get the job done, but because our utility couldn’t get the paperwork done to approve our system before it was too late for the tax credit. For now, the project is on hold.  
The rationale behind eliminating the renewable energy tax credits, as expressed by President Donald Trump, is because they were created as part of the effort to address climate change, which according to his mind is a hoax. Never mind that energy tax credits help folks like us keep our utility bills affordable.
So instead, in his so-called Big Beautiful Bill, the Republican Congress deleted the residential solar credits, which were a direct benefit to homeowners and consumers, and replaced them with $40 billion (over 10 years) in new tax subsidies to the oil, gas, and coal industries (which already benefited from $2.6 billion annually in tax subsidies).  I guess the oil companies, all of which have reported billions in profits, needed more help than homeowners.
Yes, we homeowners were also costing the U.S. Treasury with our tax credits. Official estimates are that they would have cost $25 billion over the next 10 years, although up until recently the cost was much less. In 2023, it’s reported that 1.25 million homeowners took advantage of the credits, averaging about $5,084 per family and “costing” the Treasury $6.3 billion.
In the early years the cost to the Treasury of the solar credit was dramatically smaller, in large part because the panels were a lot more expensive. It wasn’t until very recently that the cost of solar panels dropped by something like 80%. When the cost dropped so much, the rooftop solar industry grew exponentially as did the workforce needed to install the systems. The tax credit simply injected additional momentum into an industry that has strong appeal to homeowners. It had the additional benefit of creating tens of thousands of jobs and adding billions of dollars to the economy at the local level where it does the most good.
So now we have energy policy that further biases a federal tax system against helping average middle-class homeowners cut their costs and become more energy independent. Thanks to the Big Beautiful Bill, more federal tax subsidies go to already immensely profitable fossil fuel corporations.
You can decide if you think this is the right policy, but to me it feels like more government by the rich for the rich while the rest of us are ignored.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/rooftopsolar-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-14 05:58:34.366829

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)Thousands of protesters turned out across Ohio on Saturday, days after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis shot a protester there in the face, killing her. As the protests took place, advocates worked to organize responses to future ICE actions in the Buckeye State.
In Columbus, people turned out at the intersection of North Broadway and High Street, carrying signs and chanting condemnations of the shooting. 
A Columbus police officer said that Saturday protests there are routine. But where they normally draw crowds numbering in the dozens, he estimated Saturday’s to be about 300. 
Lynn Tramonte, founder of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance, said that large crowds also turned out to protest in Cleveland, Akron, and Youngstown.
They were protesting a masked ICE agent’s shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good. Good was behind the wheel of her SUV when the agent, Jonathan E. Ross, shot her from point-blank range.

Just after the shooting, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and later President Donald Trump claimed that Good was trying to run over the masked agent. 
A New York Times analysis contradicted that claim. It displayed video evidence showing that Good was steering her vehicle away from the agent when he shot her.
The killing comes after an ICE supervisor in Ohio was accused last month of multiple violent attacks against his much-younger, noncitizen partner. They also follow the sentencing last year of another Ohio officer who extorted sex from a vulnerable immigrant who was in his care.
In Columbus, people lined the wet streets, carrying signs that said things like “Ice Out,” and “No Kings, No Thugs. Stop the Chaos, Cruelty, Corruption.” 
Many passing vehicles honked their horns in support of the protest. But one man driving a pickup pulled up, rolled down his window and said, “Kill them all.” Asked who he wanted to see killed, he repeated himself, rolled up his window and drove off. 
Many others, however, say they want to defend immigrants and others ICE is targeting. 
Izetta Thomas is a member of the Columbus Education and Justice Coalition. The group works for equity and justice in general. But it started working to protect immigrants after the Trump administration last year started rounding up people by the thousands.
“I don’t think our group came to the issue, the issue came to us,” Thomas said. 
“We have a number of students and parents and neighbors in Columbus whose freedoms and rights are at risk, who are being terrorized by military raids that are coming into our city and neighborhoods. Anything that happens in or outside the school doors is our business. And anything that happens in our neighborhoods impacts our students’ lives.”
Tramonte said that people across Ohio can call her group’s hotline — 419-777-HELP (4357) — to find groups near them that react to ICE raids and assist immigrants in other ways. She said people in Central Ohio can also reach out to the Community Response Hub.
Tramonte was asked if there were resources instructing citizens on how they can monitor and protest ongoing ICE operations legally and safely. She said the SALUTE system lays out the details observers should take down, and local groups know how to go about doing it.
But last week’s shooting in Minneapolis illustrates the risks, Tramonte said.
“The ‘safely’ part is where I’m getting caught up,” she said. “Because it’s supposed to be safe, but we’re seeing federal law enforcement act in ways that if local police acted that way, they wouldn’t be able to get away with it. Pulling people out of cars, walking up and shooting people in the face… ‘Safely’ the part where I’m getting hung up.”
Meanwhile, some parents are frustrated with the way Dublin City Schools dealt with ICE detentions near at least one of its campuses on the last day before Christmas break. 
They were part of an operation that resulted in more than 280 detentions in Central Ohio that week.

At least two took place about a tenth of a mile from Dublin-Scioto High School, and at least one student was reportedly detained.
Courtney O’Neil’s son is a freshman at the school. When she heard about the ICE arrests, she started calling around to Dublin schools to find out how widespread they were
“They denied it. They said this is a rumor. It’s not true. They’re not around our schools,” O’Neil said. “They said if it did happen, they had plenty of staff to see that students could get home safely.”
She said it was plain to her that those assurances were hollow.
“They’re targeting the parents,” she said of ICE. “They’re targeting the kids (who are) just trying to go to the schools and get an education.”
Asked to comment, Dublin City Schools spokeswoman Cassie Dietrich referred to a written statement the district issued on Dec. 22.
“No immigration enforcement officials were on Dublin City Schools property, no officials were inside our schools, and at this time, Dublin City Schools is not aware of any students being detained,” it said.
It added, “Through our communication with the Dublin Police Department, we have been informed that the only confirmed activity involved a traffic stop at the corner of Emerald Parkway and Hard Road, which was not connected to Dublin City Schools. Dublin Police have also shared that they did not participate in or direct any federal immigration enforcement related to this situation.”
Thomas, of the Columbus Education and Justice Coalition, said that her group, at least, would work to help immigrant schoolchildren and others.
“We’re working to protect our students and families,” she said. “It’s causing trauma. There are folks who are afraid to go to school. There are folks who are afraid to go to work. They are afraid of the authoritarian control that is being advanced by this administration. So we’re working together to do what neighbors do, and that is keep one another safe.”",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20260110_121443-1-1024x509.jpg,,,2026-01-14 05:58:34.366829

Fracking is the process of injecting liquid into the ground at a high pressure to extract oil or gas.
The commission also voted to approve more than a dozen different areas of land to move forward to bidding for fracking. Some of the areas include 4,360 acres in Egypt Valley Wildlife Area, another 366 acres in Egypt Valley Wildlife Area, and 382 acres in Jockey Hollow Wildlife Area. 
Public hearing 
In a rare move, the commission held a public hearing before their commission meeting on Monday to discuss a new law that ups the term of a standard lease from three years to five years when leasing oil and gas rights. 
Ohio House Bill 308 passed at the end of 2024 and went into effect in March 2025. 
More than 20 people opposed to extending the fracking leases spoke out for more than an hour about the harmful effects of fracking. No one spoke out in support. People were limited to talking for three minutes and the commissioners had no comments after people offered public comment. 
“I think that high-pressure hydraulic fracturing (fracking) under public lands is a bad idea when it applies to a three-year lease for such activity, and it’s a worse idea for five-year leases,” said George Banziger, of Washington County.
“This kind of extractive activity will desecrate our valuable public lands for the current generation and for future generations by polluting air and water, drawing huge amounts of water from the watersheds that serve these public lands, adding service roads and truck traffic, and generating lots of toxic and radioactive waste.”
Ohioans have submitted almost 7,000 public comments asking the the commission to deny nominations to frack public land, said Cathy Cowan Becker, with Save Ohio Parks. 
“We don’t know if commissioners even read these comments,” she said. 
Becker hopes Ohioans can speak up regarding specific nominations at future meetings. 
“We are the people who own and use these public lands,” she said. “We deserve a real voice in what happens to them.”
Peter Maxwell said there is nothing more important to him than the preservation of the quality of water. 
“Fracking, or fracturing the Earth’s crust to extract natural gas, has other inadvertent and unavoidable consequences, including earthquakes and contamination of groundwater by the toxic chemicals injected into the voids,” said Maxwell, of Westerville. 
Linda New, of the Northeast Ohio Sierra Club, said Ohio’s state parks should be revered and protected by government agencies and officials. 
“Fracking under these publicly owned natural areas is unacceptable,” she said. “It’s irresponsible to allow this to happen for three years; extending a lease to five years is unconscionable.”
There were approximately 2,000 incidents associated with oil and gas wells in Ohio from 2015-2023, according to FracTracker Alliance — a nonprofit that collects data on fracking pipelines. 
There’s also evidence that shows increased exposure to fracking impacts health, in particular children’s health, including low birth weight, preterm births, congenital anomalies, and asthma, according to Yale School of Medicine. 
“We must care for the future of our children and grandchildren,” said Judy Smucker, of Third Act Ohioans. “May they continue to live and enjoy our public lands and parks.”
For the first time, commission Chair Theresa White took questions from the media after Monday’s meeting. 
“The public comments are one of the factors that are reviewed,” she said when asked about the board doing the opposite of what the public asked the commissioners to do. “It’s not the only factor. So we are considering all of the information that’s presented before us and really trying to weigh all of that information in one consolidated case with either a yes or no answer.”

(Morgan Trau, WEWS.)Defying the state GOP establishment, Northwest Ohio business owner Casey Putsch is going head-to-head with Vivek Ramaswamy to become the Republican nominee for governor. In a one-on-one interview, he discusses his goals, platform and prior comments made about the Holocaust.
Growing up building cars, Putsch had no idea that in 2026, he would be standing in front of a crowd of supporters.
The car designer said he is the working-class answer to the Ohio governor’s race —distinguishing himself as the everyman to frontrunner Vivek Ramaswamy.
Putsch lives with his wife and daughter, plus a baby on the way, in Perrysburg. He went to Ohio State University and started the Genius Garage Educational Program, a nonprofit where he helps students build and restore cars.
Ramaswamy and his team declined to comment for this story.
Because the following conversation was 40 minutes long, it has been lightly edited for clarity, conciseness and length.
Trau: “Why did you decide that running for governor was something that you wanted to do?”
Putsch: “Well, the simple answer is, I looked around, and I saw options that I thought were in nobody’s best interest. Vivek, I’m not a fan. He seems to be a billionaire, and his entire track record shows that he cares about his own self-interest versus anybody else’s. He’s done very little in Ohio, so that just simply wasn’t right. As one ages, you have a family, you’re trying to build businesses, and you struggle, and you see the difficulties, you see what’s happening in government. When you look objectively at candidates in the future, and if you’re really not happy about it, well then, your one opportunity is to exercise our governmental right and run for office.”
Trau: “Your slogan: Saving Ohio. Can you explain to me what that means?”
Putsch: “Well, it’s multifactorial, but it means exactly what it sounds like. I don’t think any of the roads we are going down are in our best interest. Nobody really gets new jobs; there’s a tremendous amount of fraud going on. We get sold out to only billionaire interests, massive corporate interests that, frankly, just end up taking advantage of all the people of Ohio and our resources. It seems like Ohio needs some saving.”
Trau: “Saving from corruption or from interests that don’t align with everyday people?”
Putsch: “Yeah, all the above. My first and biggest and only interest is specifically the people of Ohio. Can you build a family? Can you build a community? Can you build a business? And can you believe in a future? Amy Acton, with the Democrats, she quit as health director. She locked down the state — that’s a non-option. Vivek, a billionaire, he didn’t go to school in Ohio. Heck, he took a scholarship from George Soros’ money. He has no businesses in Ohio. He’s done no philanthropic work in Ohio despite his massive wealth — just runs for office. Heck, he could have been indulged and made the future great and saved the United States trillions of dollars.
That’s how I know that we’ve got a campaign that’s going somewhere, partially because the people, the support and the outreach are frankly unbelievable. Truth be told, this is incredibly risky for me in every way, shape and form. Politics is a horrific, dirty world. No, this was not on my life bingo card.”
Trau: “Typically, governors will have a main focus throughout their administration. What do you think yours would be?”
Putsch: “We’re being sold out to billionaire interests. The data centers, massive concerns, OK? They have tax abatements for 10 to 15 years, nothing coming in. We’re subsidizing the costs through the electricity because they suck the same amount of power as small towns. The environmental impact on our freshwater, our aquifers, our lakes, our streams, that’s horrific. We have been sold out, but people didn’t expect it. You have to have a leader who can be firm against things like that.
It’s realizing the resources we have from natural resources, natural gas, to coal, to building power-dense energy in the future, so it’s good for all. If tech wants to come here with data centers, well, they’re going to have to do it in a way that rises to the tide for everybody, and it becomes a net gain and not just a leech for the people of Ohio and a resource like it’s set up now. Bring back the manufacturing to the cities and the towns that want it and need it.
[My business,] we’ve worked very hard to pick up where the American educational system leaves off, and in doing that for the 11 years, I’ve seen exactly at the root cause of why it’s failing, from the financial model to how it’s looked at to the government, even K through 12. We can simply fix that as well.”
Trau: “What do you make of the current funding structure for public schools? Do you think that we are doing right by public schools right now? What do you think about the private school voucher system?”
Putsch: “There needs to be full transparency to all of the public in terms of what’s actually being taught in the curriculum, even if for no other reason than we need to have that for the trust of the public to make sure there’s nothing weird going on, and I don’t mean that as a partisan thing. If you have any institution, and in that circumstance, public schools where there’s no competition, and their funding is basically guaranteed, whether it’s from the government or people, then they’re going to naturally become worse. They’re not going to have to compete. I know you want a specific answer relating to the voucher system, but as a general rule of thumb, competition’s good. The people deserve the power to know what’s right, to know that weird curricula are not happening.
So with regard to education, all of my policies will relate specifically from the government down to the schools are accountable for actually creating the right curriculum. Some things can be solved with money, but many things cannot. We’ve got to support our teachers. They’re the most valuable thing. If we don’t, they’re gone.”
Trau: “To pivot, do you feel like you’re facing an uphill battle because the GOP already had a uniquely early endorsement of Vivek Ramaswamy before you actually even got into the race? The endorsement comes with financial and logistical benefits. Are you worried about that?”
Putsch: “Actually, no. I could understand why you asked the question; it’s a great question. I think most people would look at it just at a cursory glance and think that, but the truth about what’s happening is what you said — money. All of this is literally only about money. They’re already dumping tens of millions of dollars, more money toward Vivek than what a primary normally costs, because what’s happening is they’re trying to simply buy it out across the board.
The tide has shifted real fast because the cracks in Vivek’s facade have shown, and everybody knows this is only about establishment and money. Vivek’s interests are not that of Ohio. They do seem to be globalists. They seem to be only in the interest of billionaires to sell us out to corporations, and that’s also seen with his personal actions in the past. The people are behind me, and the truth of the matter is that at the end of the day, the only endorsement that matters is a person when they go in the polling booth.”
Trau: “Do you think it’s fair to Ohioans that they really didn’t get a Republican primary prior to a lot of these endorsements?”
Putsch: “No, it’s not fair at all. It’s undermining our governmental system. It’s not fair to all of us.”
Trau asked him to address his lieutenant governor pick. Putsch didn’t disclose any details at the time of the interview, as he was announcing his running mate the following day. He chose Kim Georgeton, from Cincinnati, who previously ran unsuccessfully in the GOP primary against U.S. Rep. Dave Taylor for Congress. Putsch did, however, say that Ramaswamy’s choice — Senate President Rob McColley — was an “establishment swamp creature that has nobody’s interest in mind.”
Trau: “Let’s talk policy. Where do you stand on marijuana reform?”
Putsch: “Personally, I don’t like marijuana. I think it’s just another thing that distracts people from making a good future. I believe in freedom and in regard to looking at that though, it just comes down to objectively what’s in the best interest of all the people in the state, and I’ll be deferring to others to make that judgment.”
Trau: “But as governor, you would have a say.”
Putsch: “Of course, I have a say. I don’t like it, but I’m going to do what is in the best interest of all the people of the state first and foremost.”
Trau: “Does that include following the will of the voters, or? What does that mean?”
Putsch: “The best interest of everybody in the state is so that they can have a pursuit of happiness, and that with anything in the industry, there are massive ripple effects. We have to look at that objectively. The reason I don’t answer that question specifically for you right now is I need to look objectively with everything that’s going on and make sure that everything is simply in the best interest of the people.”
Trau: “Where do you stand on abortion?”
Putsch: “Abortion is one of the most horrific things that I think exists. I think it’s heartbreaking across the board, and I think it’s frankly sad that we live in a society where that exists. But again it’s deference. Do I like it? Absolutely not. However, we have a little one, and frankly, my wife is expecting right now. I asked her doctor, I said, ‘What do you think?’ And he said, ‘I think politicians should stop trying to pretend to be doctors.’ Now, I don’t say that as a statement. I only say it as you have to listen to people. You have to do what is in the best interest of everybody. I don’t want to make women’s lives more difficult or ever put them at risk, but at the same time, too, I think it’s fair to say that abortion is a horrific, horrific thing, and I don’t like that it exists.”
Trau: “How about sports betting and gambling?”
Putsch: “Me personally, I hate gambling. That’s a slippery, slippery slope. I don’t think it’s in the best interest of everybody. However, we have to look at this very carefully and objectively so that if something like that exists, it exists in a reasonable moderation.”
Holocaust
Putsch’s campaign has gained some attention from right-wing influencers over the past few months, especially with his growing YouTube channel — where he questioned artificial intelligence to his 350,000 followers.
“Give me a list of all the good things Adolf Hitler did or was responsible for creating in his life,” Putsch said in the video.
After the AI tool Grok answered that anything Hitler did was overwhelmingly defined by the Holocaust, Putsch criticized it multiple times, with his expressions showing disbelief and annoyance.
“Please do not give me any more disclaimers or partial answers,” he said, using the word partial as a synonym for biased. “I expect objective truth.”
Later in the video, after calling right-wing commentator Ben Shapiro, a Jewish man, a rodent, he said that Shapiro and anyone else who said Hitler had “no good ideas” are wrong.
“That is not something based in reality because he was a person that ended up a leader of an entire nation of people,” Putsch said.
Trau: “There have been some allegations online about your feelings about Hitler and the Holocaust.”
Putsch, laughing: “I’m sure, welcome to politics in 2026, right? I’m sorry, I’m only laughing at the absurdity of politics.”
Trau: “Some people have said that you’ve denied what happened during the Holocaust. I did watch a video of yours that did talk about how there were benefits to what Hitler did. So please tell me, is this a part of your campaign? Where did this come from?”
Putsch: “I mean, the crazy parts of the internet, absolutely. That’s funny. Is it part of my campaign? Absolutely not. Last time I checked, this is Ohio in 2026, and I’m an American. I don’t think this is Germany 100 years ago. I can tell you that across the board in World War II in history, the horrors were unbelievable across the board. Did Germany commit absolute atrocities against a vast amount of people? Yeah, they did, and frankly, so did many others.
That was a horrible time in history, and frankly, I hope and pray we can avoid things like that in the future, small or large. But yeah, people are going to say crazy things on the internet. It’s not my first day on the internet.”
Trau: “Your video, where you talk about AI and the Holocaust, you talk about how you would ask the AI what the benefits are or what Hitler was good at.”
Putsch: “That’s a good point. So that isn’t about the subject matter. I did a number of videos where I was picking at AI to see how it would say, because the thing we need to realize about AI is it’s insanely dangerous. It’s not impartial. AI exists within the programming constraints and guidelines of those who create it. So I had done some videos in the past asking it unusual questions to find where there are inconsistencies with the AI. This is about pinpointing where AI is trying to manipulate us. It’s trying to pigeonhole us, and it’s trying to, frankly, program us…
I did those thought experiments only to pick at AI, so that I could show where it’s frankly taking advantage and programming all of us.”
Trau: “Is it programming all of us when you ask what Hitler’s best qualities were, and it brings up the atrocities of the Holocaust?”
Putsch: “It doesn’t always do things like that. AI is programming us no matter what we do… It has nothing to do with the events. It has nothing to do with where my standpoint is. It has to do with finding and using those as techniques to find where AI is taking advantage of all of us in every way, shape, and form. It’s just a hyperbolic way to do it.”
Online hate
Ramaswamy has not engaged directly with Putsch, but in a guest essay for the New York Times, he did say there was no room in the conservative movement for people who thought Hitler was “cool.” He also condemned the racist comments he faced online, many from a faction of users called “groypers.”
Trau: “Vivek Ramaswamy is leaving social media. He also talked about the influx of racism against him. Some Republicans talk about bots. What do you make of the groypers?”
Putsch: “I’d say the first thing is, ‘Hey, put on your big boy pants, Mr. Billionaire, you can’t take it?’ He wanted to group everybody into a corral, because if you don’t like Vivek Ramaswamy, it’s because you’re a racist, terrible person and not because Vivek Ramaswamy is actually a garbage candidate who clearly doesn’t care about the people of Ohio or America, and it’s kind of a globalist corporate billionaire interest. No, no, ‘it’s because you’re racist.’ That was a tactic. He got backlash. It’s just a tactic by somebody who’s already losing.”
Once again, Ramaswamy and his team declined to comment. His accounts, however, continue to face an onslaught of slurs consistently from many accounts associated with the right-wing.

SPRINGFIELD, Ohio — Since last summer, Casey Rollins has braced for the day that children of Haitian immigrants would walk into the Catholic charity she runs without their parents.
That day has arrived.
First, one group of siblings. The next day, another. In one week last month, nine children whose parents were no longer in the country came in with their extended families.
Rollins and other advocates for immigrants fear these are the first cases in a looming avalanche of family separations that could overwhelm this city of about 60,000 in a central Ohio county that has in recent years absorbed an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 immigrants, many of them Haitians.
Rollins has worked closely with Haitian immigrants since becoming executive director of Springfield’s St. Vincent de Paul at the end of 2016. At first, the Catholic charity focused on providing language assistance to Haitian Creole speakers. Then she connected them to the charity’s thrift store for the warm clothing they would need to endure winter in Ohio and furniture and appliances to set up their new homes. The community center also offered computer access for them to apply for work permits and look for jobs in one of the companies that were drawn to the area by state economic incentives, like the massive Amazon warehouses and distribution centers in neighboring counties.
Employers specifically recruited Haitian workers via staffing agencies for hard-to-fill positions, their ads touting above-minimum-wage pay and benefits, luxuries for immigrants coming from a country ravaged by decades of political turmoil and a pair of earthquakes that killed and displaced hundreds of thousands of people. Arrivals in Springfield ticked up during the COVID-19 pandemic as more people emigrated from Haiti after the president was assassinated and violence worsened. Others came from big cities with deeply rooted Haitian communities, like Miami and New York, drawn by the promise of well-paying jobs in an affordable community that seemed to want them there.

The city of Springfield, Ohio, which is home to thousands of Haitian families, is scrambling to get ready for mass deportations that will likely leave many children without their parents. (Photo by Maddie McGarvey for The 19th.)
Then, during last year’s presidential election, Springfield’s Haitians became the target of a maelstrom of misinformation after someone posted online that they were eating their neighbors’ pets. President Donald Trump amplified the lie, as did Vice President JD Vance, who grew up an hour’s drive away, in Middletown, Ohio. Neither the city nor its newest arrivals could stop or control what came next. Neo-Nazi and white nationalist groups like Blood Tribe and Patriot Front disrupted community events and staged protests in front of City Hall and the mayor’s house. Phoned-in bomb threats forced the temporary closure of schools. In February, the city of Springfield and targeted individuals sued Blood Tribe over its intimidation campaign. Rollins, who lives across the street from the mayor, is one of the other plaintiffs.
It’s almost as if the threats and volatility only fueled and refocused Rollins, who does not accept a salary for her work. As the world around the Haitians in Springfield changed, the types of services offered by St. Vincent de Paul shifted, too — from helping them establish a life in the city to navigating the Trump administration’s immigration policies that threaten their ability to legally stay in the country.
On the day of his inauguration, Trump issued an executive order — “protecting the American people against invasion,” he called it — setting the tone for what was to come. He has since attempted to move up the expiration date of Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, which allows people from Haiti and other designated countries facing conflict or natural disaster to live and work in the United States for a set period of time. He also terminated a Biden-era program known as humanitarian parole, urging immigrants protected by it to self-deport and revoking their ability to work. (These and other pieces of his immigration measures have been challenged in court.)
There were 210,000 Haitians in the United States on humanitarian parole as of late last year. There are currently some 330,000 Haitians in the country with TPS, including thousands in the Springfield area. As things stand, the deadline for them to leave the country is February 3.
Over the summer, as immigration agents moved to detain and deport immigrants all across the United States, sometimes to countries that are not their own, Rollins and others at St. Vincent de Paul used every opportunity available to them to tell Haitian parents to get their U.S.-born children American passports.

Casey Rollins says nine children in two days have shown up with their immigrant parents already gone and in need of custody arrangements when there are only 17 foster families in all of Springfield. (Photo by Maddie McGarvey for The 19th.)
“If the child has a passport and the parents have to take the child with them, or have to give the child to a family in a different country — say they have to send them to a family member in Chile, or they have to take them to Chile — well, the child can’t travel to Chile without a passport,” she said.
The passports are also proof of U.S. citizenship, a critical shield at a time when even U.S. citizens are being caught in Trump’s immigration crackdown.
Rollins’ efforts soon bumped up against complications: a father has gone back to Haiti and is not present to sign the paperwork, a missing birth certificate must be ordered for a child born in another state. She also had to contend with the emotional ups-and-downs prompted by the helter-skelter nature of immigration policy implementation and shifting program end dates, she said.
The Haitians she works with, “keep thinking that there’s going to be a Hail Mary moment,” Rollins said. “They just have this unbelievable faith — I wish my faith was as strong as theirs is … But at the same time, I wish their faith was a little bit more pragmatic. Maybe they know better, and it is all going to work out. I hope to God they’re right. But I’m looking at this thinking, ‘No, let’s be ready. Let’s be ready for whatever comes.’”

Rollins is now preparing for a worst-case scenario that may be all but inevitable.
“I’m the town crier, literally and figuratively. That’s all I seem to do these days,” Rollins told The 19th during a recent interview. She was sitting at a table at St. Vincent de Paul, shading in this year’s Christmas card featuring her seven grandchildren — or, as she put it, the “seven little activists” who “go out on picket lines with me.” The cards often get political. Last year’s theme was “love thy neighbor” and featured Santa Claus looking out the window of the community center at a line of immigrants waiting to get in, drawn over a collage of headlines about Springfield’s Haitian residents. This year’s states: “I need to be able to tell my grandchildren that I did not stay silent.”
She dabbed at her eyes as she talked, wondering what might happen to the Haitian parents she has come to know and, most of all, wondering what might happen to their children.
On a recent Thursday, the local NAACP chapter convened a town hall at a Baptist church with the theme “preparation for mass deportations.” The seats were nearly full, and people stood in the back of the nave, lining the walls. Security was heavy; three police cars parked out front. NAACP President Denise Williams introduced a panel that included Rollins; Viles Dorsainvil, director of the Haitian Community Help and Support Center; Carl Ruby, a local pastor whose congregation is heavily invested in assisting local immigrants; and key city officials: Mayor Rob Rue, City Manager Bryan Heck, Police Chief Allison Elliott and Clark County Health Commissioner Chris Cook.

When it was her turn to speak, Rollins leaned into the microphone and introduced herself. “Hello. I’m Casey Rollins, and I’m a servant leader at St. Vincent de Paul. I am part of a ministry that is from all over the world.” She felt a pit in her stomach.
At St. Vincent de Paul, she noted, the “number one priority for us is always the children — always, always, always, think of our children.” Then, she laid out what has been obvious to her since the summer: The deportation of Haitian parents may very likely result in a “child custodial dependency crisis in this town, in this state, in this country.” Because parents may be deported after a raid, without the chance to decide whether to bring their children when they leave the country. And because they may choose to leave their children behind to give them a shot at living a safer, more stable life in the United States. For many of these kids, this is their country.
She explained that she and the workers at St. Vincent de Paul had already helped Haitian immigrants obtain passports for their U.S.-born children, sometimes at a rate of three to four a day. But, she said, the passports wouldn’t be enough.
A ripple went through the crowd when Rollins told them about the nine children who had come to St. Vincent de Paul after their parents’ deportations. There were audible gasps. When it came time for questions, nearly every one of them was about the children.
Cook added that there are more than 1,300 children in Clark County who have been born to Haitian parents in the last few years alone, meaning all of them would be citizens. The number is likely far higher, plus thousands of children who emigrated from Haiti and more who were born in another country during their parents’ immigration journey.
“The volume of need for this service far exceeds the service we’re able to provide,” Rollins cautioned. “Please, please, bear with us all as we cry a lot, as we rage a lot. Feel free to do that with us. Come see us if you’d like to be a part of this initiative and this effort.”

Volunteers packed 1,200 Christmas food baskets this week, some of which will be delivered directly to Haitian families. (Photo by Maddie McGarvey for The 19th.)
From a legal standpoint, assisting minors remaining in the country without parents may require action in two different court systems: family and immigration. Children who are U.S. citizens will need legal guardians to sign paperwork for passports and other documents and to handle routine matters like school enrollment and doctors’ visits. Many will need to pursue a type of guardianship that is triggered by an emergency event, like a deportation or detainment, in order to maintain custody of their children while they are still here.
Noncitizen children will also need guardians — and they will have their own immigration cases to contend with.
Rollins and others assisting Haitian families want to find a way to avoid a potentially chaotic period when decisions cannot be made on a child’s behalf because they don’t yet have a legal guardian. To succeed, they need to find lawyers to take cases that touch both court systems.
Rollins — a 66-year-old from a large Irish Catholic family who taught school for 34 years and educated many of Springfield’s leaders — is a woman of faith who also believes in the power of community. That’s what she’s leaning on these days.
About two weeks ago, a juvenile court magistrate texted her a photo of the business card for Bridget Emiko Jackson, a family court lawyer who was just telling the magistrate that she wanted to take on more immigration cases. Within minutes of receiving the text, Rollins and Jackson were talking on the phone.
“I couldn’t get out of the courthouse parking lot before I heard from Casey,” Jackson said. “Next thing I know, I’m working on a presentation.”
Jackson is putting the finishing touches on a series of slides that lay out what a legal process could look like to assist children with guardianship. A friend and former law school classmate she now practices alongside has jumped in to assist. Their goal is to have it ready for potential funders, volunteers, other lawyers, community groups and relevant government agencies as early as this week.

Casey Rollins talks with Lou Ann Horstman of Springfield Neighbors United at Groceryland in Springfield, OH on December 11, 2025. (Maddie McGarvey for The 19th.)
Rollins knows there will need to be many more people like Jackson to handle the number of guardianship cases that will very likely arise under the current climate — and if the February deadline for the end of TPS holds. She keeps hundreds of informational sheets about filling out child passport applications and creating family immigration raid emergency plans on the long table just past St. Vincent de Paul’s front doors. Two volunteers spent last week fully focused on immigration matters as others began to pack 1,200 Christmas food baskets. Some will be hand-delivered to Haitian families.
She noted that already, people have reached out to help, at times “transcending their politics.” Groups like Springfield Neighbors United, a critical partner in the passport effort, and G92 have formed to help the cause. Leaders from the Nation of Islam are working in concert with Catholic nuns. Rollins hasn’t always agreed with the city’s elected leaders, but works with them closely because, she said, “I believe in people who believe in people.”
And she is choosing to believe in the underlying goodness of the people of Springfield, where she grew up, married, worked and raised her son. She is choosing to believe they will not let their Haitian neighbors down.

Laura Kelly delivers her State of the State speech on Jan. 13, 2026, in the Kansas House. (Photo by Thad Allton for Kansas Reflector)Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly gave her final state of the state address Tuesday night, and it found her in a valedictory mood.
Speaking to a joint session of the House and Senate, Kelly listed a familiar litany of her accomplishments (restoring fiscal stability, balancing budgets, funding schools, bringing new jobs to the state) while celebrating the Kansas City Chiefs’ move across the border from Missouri. Yet reading the speech closely, one could detect a note of regret here and there, a touch of sadness.
For the fact is, Kelly’s tenure was defined as much by what she prevented than what she accomplished.
Republican leaders would have slashed education spending, doubled down on the failed economic agenda of former Republican Gov. Sam Brownback, done even more damage to LGBTQ+ youths. Kelly slowed or stopped much of this retrograde agenda. But next year, someone else will be giving the state of the state address, and Kansas will have entered a new era.
“If you think about the last decade in America, the speed of change we’ve endured is staggering,” Kelly told the crowd. “We now live our lives attached to devices. It’s now how we do business, how we keep up with the news, how we talk to our coworkers and our friends, even our own grandchildren.
“And in the midst of it all, we also survived a global pandemic, only to return to a world changing even faster — with remote work, AI bots, and cars that drive themselves.”
Ah, the pandemic. Kelly had scarcely a year in office before COVID-19 scrambled her plans. Medicaid expansion, one of her top priorities on the campaign trail, gave way to the urgent necessity of keeping Kansans alive as a deadly virus swept across the state. Lawmakers like former Sen. Mark Steffen, R-Hutchinson, made political hay of the confusion.
Years after the pandemic were distinguished by huge federal recovery spending, which brought its own conflicts and controversies. Kelly won a second a term, thanks to the a lackadaisical campaign by then-Attorney General Derek Schmidt, who is now a congressman. But an enduring GOP supermajority limited her options, and she doubled down on economic development as her signature accomplishment.
Kelly had perhaps hoped to begin a new era of bipartisanship and collaboration with Kansas Republicans. Instead, they badmouthed her from the beginning, claiming she didn’t have a mandate. Her final state of the state touched on this as well.

“Instead of representing their communities, elected officials turned into foot soldiers for their political parties — firing off insults and vitriol to score likes or follows or wins for their team instead of doing what’s right for their constituents,” she said. “It’s as if they checked their free will at the door and just did as they were told. Treating their own colleagues in such angry and dehumanizing ways, just because they’re in the other party.
“And the most frightening part — it’s now become the new normal. An accepted part of political discourse. Well, I reject it. We must all reject it.”
You can see Kelly’s trademark soft touch here: She uses the plural “parties” as though she’s referring to both Democrats and Republicans. Anyone who has watched Kansas politics since 2018 knows the latter bears the lion’s share of the blame here. It’s not even close. Kansas Republican Party officials have turned blind eyes to shocking rhetoric in their pursuit of political power.
In some ways, Kelly reminds me of a president with close Kansas ties, Barack Obama. Like her, Obama ran for office as someone who transcended partisanship. However, once he moved into the executive suite, he found that Republican opponents had decided to face him with all their collected fury.
Obama spent eight years as president attempting to collaborate across the aisle. Instead, Republicans operatives such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner channeled dark currents in their own party to prevent progress.
Their work bore fruit, eventually, with the election of Donald Trump, a crude and bombastic would-be authoritarian.
Let’s hope that Kansas leaders leave us a better legacy after Kelly’s tenure.
She summed up her legacy Tuesday night: “I did not get elected governor — twice — by screaming the loudest or bullying others to get my way. Quite the opposite, I’m here because Kansans were looking for someone who would turn the volume down, to do more listening than yelling, to bring people together, to compromise, and govern from the middle.”
Kelly stood against feckless partisans and should be commended for her steadfastness. She remains in office throughout the year, and who knows what surprises await. But her plans for Kansas, and her theory of politics, saw only partial fulfillment over the past decade. If only government worked the way she suggests.

(Getty Images file photo.)The acreages that make up the Wayne National Forest in Southeastern Ohio are a patchwork of land parcels which lie in 12 Ohio counties.  
In the 1800s, the region was heavily logged to supply wood for 46 charcoal furnaces used for iron smelting. Farming also damaged the landscape as the remaining areas were cleared for agriculture, causing destructive soil erosion. 
Nature, time, and help from the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s helped restore the second-growth forests we see today. 
Sadly, the oil and gas industry is seeking to frack parcels within the wooded areas, possibly destroying the vibrant mesophytic ecosystem that has evolved over the last nearly 100 years. 
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) will be accepting oil and gas leasing applications in September 2026 for 41 oil and gas parcels, totaling 2,795 acres. These parcels of the Wayne are located in Monroe and Washington Counties. 
Currently, they are seeking public input (written comments) pertaining to the 2026 lease sale. These comments are due on Jan. 15, 2026 and can be submitted via the Bureau of Land Management site.
More than 85% of Ohio forests are privately owned, making the Wayne National Forest very important for Ohio residents and non-residents. 
This forest remains a sanctuary for people who need an escape from their hectic lives.

Visitors find peaceful settings, as well as spaces for recreating, bird watching, and fishing in the natural environment provided by the Wayne. 
There are hundreds of miles of hiking trails, horse riding trails, mountain biking trails, and off-road vehicle trails. Over a quarter million visitors find their way to the Wayne every year. 
The Little Muskingum River flows through the middle of the Marietta Unit of the forest. 
It “has an exceptional warmwater quality designation” and species like the rare river otter and the state endangered Ohio lamprey make their homes in the river. 
Additionally, the Wayne is critical habitat for the eastern hellbender salamander, a species which has been proposed for listing as an endangered species. 
When speaking of fracking in Ohio’s State Parks in 2024, then-state Rep. Don Jones said, “You will never know where fracking has occurred”. I strongly disagree. 
I live in Harrison County, one of the most fracked areas of Southeastern Ohio. 
Well pads and fracking infrastructure have taken over the rural landscape. 
Examining areas around the towns of Scio, Cadiz, and Jewett via a satellite image with Google Maps reveals over 179 well pads in the county. 
These appear like small white squares on the Google landscape map, but if you zoom in on these pads, you will see some of the infrastructure associated with fracking; large storage containers, wells, compressors, roads, and often the outline of pipelines crossing through the areas. 
These well pads are not reclaimed because many times wells are often re-fracked. 
What was once a region of rural beauty has become an industrial zone, as fracking eats away at the wooded hills like metastatic cancer. 
Fracking significantly impacts forests, as land is altered for well pads, roads, pipelines, and other infrastructure. 
Research shows that up to 19 acres per well pad is needed for gathering lines. In addition to gathering pipelines, there are transition pipelines, and distribution pipelines, as well as roads to the well pads. 
The construction of this infrastructure results in clearcutting of the forested area, which leaves gaps in the forest canopy. Think of it as death by a thousand cuts. 
The Halliburton loophole legislation of 2005 exempted natural gas drilling from most federal regulations created to protect human health and the environment. 
Companies are exempt from disclosing the chemicals used during hydraulic fracturing but an EPA assessment reported there were at least 1,606 chemicals used in fracking that could impact drinking water. Leaks, spills, and runoff from operations threaten groundwater and surface water quality, impacting aquatic ecosystems. 
Billions of gallons of radioactive waste brine are generated by the industry. 
This brine, although toxic in nature, is exempt from the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. 
Every day “brine” tankers travel through fracked communities to deliver the toxic brew to Class II injection wells. 
Fracking the Wayne, especially in the Washington County region, could mean more Class II wells for an area already dealing with well contamination issues from brine infiltration into production wells.

The process of high-pressure hydraulic fracking requires 1.5-16 million gallons of water per well.
In Ohio, a facility is allowed to withdraw surface water in the amount of “up to two million gallons per day in any thirty-day period without first obtaining a permit from the chief of the division of water resources under section 1521.29 of the Revised Code.” 
Ohio saw record droughts in the summers of 2024 and 2025. 
Counties where fracking is ongoing experienced extreme and exceptional droughts in 2024.  
Withdrawing water from streams decreases volume, increases pollution concentrations, increases water temperatures, decreases dissolved oxygen, and affects the pH, making streams less habitable for aquatic organisms.
Surface water will no doubt be withdrawn from the local streams in the Wayne National Forest. 
Fracking creates air pollution that can seriously impact wildlife. 
A Colorado study revealed that exposure to air pollution from fracking could cause neurological problems, respiratory diseases, and cancer in wild animals. 
Some of the compounds released during fracking include benzene, a known carcinogen, as well as xylenes and nitrogen oxides. 
Studies show these compounds can cause cancers, particularly if exposure occurs within a 0.5-mile radius of a well pad. 
There are additional issues that will impact the rural area that makes up the Wayne National Forests. 
The hydraulic fracturing process requires 2,300 to 4,000 truck trips per well. Many of the roads in rural areas are not built to withstand the amount and weight of these trucks and additional traffic has resulted in an increase in vehicular accidents. 
Anthropogenic noise from fracking reduces habitat quality and interferes with communication for species that rely on acoustic communication. 
The bright lights on the drilling rigs and pads can significantly impact birds, especially during migration. 
A 2020 study shows “shale oil and gas production reduces subsequent bird population counts by 15%, even after adjusting for location and year fixed effects, weather, counting effort, and anthropic land-use changes.” 
Ohio’s Republican legislature and Gov. Mike DeWine sacrificed our state parks to fracking during a lame duck session in 2022. 
Without any public comment period, our parks were opened up for fracking. 
Now our only national forest and the rural communities surrounding it will become a new sacrificial zone. 
The BLM says on its page, “The preliminary parcel list is not subject to protests or appeals.” 
Does this mean Ohio’s citizens have no recourse? 
At the very least, we need to let our concerns be known to the Bureau of Land Management.

(Photo by Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator via SouthWings)The Atalco refinery in Gramercy will receive federal funding to produce more critical minerals under a new agreement between its Bermuda-based owners and the U.S. Department of Defense.
The partnership includes a $450 million investment that will allow the facility to produce gallium, a soft metal used in semiconductors, and to ramp up its refinement of aluminum oxide, a feedstock mineral used to make finished aluminum, according to a news release from Louisiana Economic Development.
The plant is expected to produce over 1 million metric tons of alumina per year and up to 50 metric tons of gallium per year under a new agreement between the U.S. government and Atalco’s owner, Concord Resources Holdings Ltd., a firm domiciled in Bermuda with offices around the world.  
A Louisiana refinery spilled toxic waste into the community and knew about it for months

The investment includes $150 million in funding from the Defense Department. Concord and its majority shareholder, Pinnacle Asset Management, will invest another $300 million in private equity and expects to receive more federal funding, according to a separate news release from the company.
“For the past decade, our investment philosophy has centered on bolstering the U.S. supply chain for critical minerals and other commodities,” said Jason Kellman, Pinnacle’s chief investment officer. “This strategic partnership plays an important role in strengthening our country’s critical minerals supply.”
The new additions to the plant are expected to create 500 new jobs, according to the company’s press release.
Atalco, which also goes by Atlantic Alumina, is the only remaining alumina refinery in the U.S
and has been the subject of investigative reports by the Illuminator over a series of toxic waste discharges state and federal inspectors have documented for the past year. 
Under one of its related enterprises, Concord mines the rust-colored mineral bauxite from Jamaica and ships it to the Atalco facility in Gramercy, where it is refined into a white aluminum oxide powder called “alumina.” The powder is then sold to metal smelters that turn it into finished aluminum metals and alloys.

(Here are Parts One and Two.)
It looks at the law’s treatment of municipal and regional housing growth plans, including what happened to H.B. 5002’s “fair share” proposal; opportunities for development; and an agenda for the General Assembly in 2026. 
At the outset we wish to be clear that as attorneys we represent affordable housing developers, proponents, and advocates who seek to create more affordable housing. However, in ways explained below, we believe the new Act will make affordable housing production more difficult, and thus the General Assembly in 2026 should review and revise the Act to at least remove or ameliorate the obstacles, and otherwise remove exclusionary barriers and positively reform local zoning.
Municipal and regional housing growth plans
The new Act (Sections 4-7) introduces “housing growth plans,” adopted by either a municipality or regional council of governments, of which there are nine:  Capitol Region, Northeastern Connecticut, Lower Connecticut River Valley, Western Connecticut, Northwest Hills, Naugatuck Valley, Greater Bridgeport, South Central, and Southeastern.
The Act repeals General Statutes § 8-30j, the part of Public Act 21-29 that mandated every municipality to prepare and file an affordable housing plan by June 2022. Nearly every municipality did so during 2021-2023. 
Section 8-30j was less than effective because it only required municipalities to prepare a plan and file it with the state Office of Policy & Management, but gave little guidance as to content or standards. The new Act, however, contains only vague guidance in the nature of aspirations, imposes a complicated review process with lengthy timelines, and has no enforcement mechanisms or penalties. (Co-author Tim Hollister co-chaired a statewide Working Group in 2022-2023 that reviewed and evaluated these plans and in a February 2023 report to the legislature, made substantive and specific recommendations for improvements in the future plans.)
The 2021-2023 plans were supposed to be valid for at least five years.  The time, effort, and expense that dozens of municipalities invested in preparing those reports are now superseded.  The new Act makes no mention of building upon the 2021-2023 reports.  This is at least illogical, because when municipalities prepare the growth plans mandated by the new Act, a natural starting point should be to use what they produced just two or three years ago.  The new Act seems to direct municipalities to start from scratch.
The overall housing growth plan process begins with OPM, by December 2026, preparing a statewide housing needs assessment.  By June 2027, each regional council must prepare a regional housing needs assessment that includes a “recommended affordable housing goal for each member municipality.”  The methodology must include:

Federal Fair Housing Act “affirmatively furthering” obligation (outreach to those most in need of housing);
“Appropriate regional metrics” and cost-burden indicators;
“Appropriate factors for fairly allocating need among municipalities, including proximity to transportation, commercial and industrial zones, employment opportunities; available developable land; and municipality’s share of multi family housing stock”; and
Adjustments based on income and poverty levels.

Each regional council submits its assessment and recommends the municipal affordable housing goals to OPM, which may not reject them “solely on the basis that such needs assessment or goal may result in a greater number of dwelling units being developed than [OPM] deems adequate.” (We think this means OPM cannot reject the goal because OPM thinks it is too high, but the wording is not clear.)  No affordable housing goal may exceed 20 percent of the “occupied dwelling units in such municipality.”
The Act then requires all municipalities in the Capitol, Northeast, Lower Connecticut River Valley, Northwest Hills, and Southeastern Connecticut regions to submit their housing growth plans to OPM by June 2028; and those in the South Central, Greater Bridgeport, Naugatuck Valley, and Western regions to submit by June 2029, and every five years thereafter.
All plans must state “housing growth policies,” which are programs and practices designed to “reduce or remove regulatory constraints on the construction, rehabilitation, repair or maintenance of affordable housing units, such as zoning regulations amendments, fee waivers, tax-fixing agreements, tax abatements, and expedited approvals;” or “actions intended to promote” affordable units such as sewer infrastructure, donations of municipal land, and “agreements with developers” for developments that include affordable units. (This provision says “or” but appears to mean “and.”)
Every plan “shall reduce specific regulatory barriers to the development of dwelling units” and “promote additional dwelling units. . . .”  In addition, the plans must:

Identify specific zones or parcels where affordable housing units that will meet the municipality affordable housing goal can be approved by “summary review;”
Promote affordable housing units that will be subject to a 40-year restriction that will preserve the units for “persons and families” that earn 30 percent, 50 percent, or 80 percent or less of the statewide or area median income;
Set forth “strategies” for diversity of unit types, and accessibility in housing for the disabled;
Explain how the plan addresses “significant disparities in housing needs” and implements the “affirmatively furthering” purposes of the federal Fair Housing Act;
Contain an inventory of “developable land;”
Identify infrastructure needs including sewer capacity to achieve the affordable housing goal; and
Contain an implementation schedule.

The 20 municipalities with the lowest “adjusted equalized net grant list per capita” have a different set of criteria for their plans. They must prioritize preservation of existing affordable units; identify policies that will promote new affordable units “without displacing existing residents;” and identify infrastructure needs of existing residents.
If a municipality proceeds with its own housing growth plan, instead of the regional plan, then at least 90 days before the municipal plan is due to OPM (June 2028 or June 2029, as listed above), it must submit its plan to its regional council, which may propose amendments within 60 days.  If the municipality rejects any proposed amendment, it must provide a written explanation to the council.  The municipality then submits its plan to OPM, which has 120 days to review and accept or reject.
If OPM rejects the plan, the municipality must submit its plan to the new Council on Housing Development, which must provide written notice, reasons, and needed amendments if it denies.  The municipality can then resubmit to the Council within 30 days.
If a municipal plan is approved, the municipality must submit an annual progress report.  OPM must publish guidance for such annual reports by March 2026.
An approved plan establishes eligibility for financial awards called “grants-in-aid,” to assist with “construction, improvement, or expansion of public infrastructure.”  Grants are based on demonstrated progress” toward the plan’s “housing growth policies and affordable housing goal.”
If a municipality fails to submit a plan within the required time frame, the chief elected officer must give OPM a filing date not more than 30 days out, and the municipality will be ineligible to apply for a four-year moratorium from § 8-30g applications until it files.
Candidly, it is hard to imagine a more convoluted set of review and approval procedures than those listed above, or a more overwhelming task for OPM than providing a meaningful review of 80-plus housing growth plans in 2028 and 2029. The Act’s requirements for these plans include both vaguely-stated aspirations yet direction to specify steps zone by zone, parcel by parcel. How will OPM assess the compliance and details? If it approves all or most plans, it will be seen as a mere rubber stamp, and if it rejects a slew of submissions, it and the legislature will be criticized for not providing adequate guidance.
Moreover, unless we are missing something, the proposed plan preparation, review and approval process contains an impossibility, because it specifies that every municipality must decide within 30 days of receiving its affordable housing goal (June 2027 deadline) whether it will adopt the regional council’s housing growth plan –a plan that is not even due to be prepared and filed until June 2028 and 2029. Again, this is an example of an apparent drafting error that scrutiny could have avoided.
But on top of this procedural morass, the Act spells out four substantive criteria for new municipal and regional housing growth plans that conflict with existing law and are destined to be dysfunctional. The requirements are that every new plan must be “consistent with:”

The municipality’s Plan of Conservation and Development, adopted under General Statutes § 8-23 and prepared every ten years by the planning commission;
The regional plan of conservation and development, adopted by the regional council within which the municipality is located;
The State of Plan of Conservation and Development; and
A “local water pollution control authority’s” (a/k/a sewer commission) plan, “if applicable.”

How do these requirements conflict with existing law and guarantee dysfunction?  Let us count the ways.
For decades, it has been an accepted element of zoning and planning in Connecticut, with narrow exceptions, that municipal plans of development are advisory only as to the adoption of zoning regulations and approval of special permits and site plans. 
Our leading land-use law treatise, Connecticut Land Use Law and Practice, written by former Judge Robert Fuller and now edited by attorney Dwight Merriam, observes that municipal “POCDs” are “a planning concept. . . not based on existing conditions and zoning but rather a blueprint for recommended future development. . .,” and are based on “studies of physical, social, economic, and governmental conditions and trends.” 
As a result, “in Connecticut, “the zoning commission. . . is not controlled by recommendations of the planning commission….” “Connecticut has always maintained the independence of the zoning commission, and periodic attempts by planners and others to give more power to the planning commission at the zoning commission’s expense have occurred.” It should be noted that while zoning regulation amendments are an ongoing responsibility, POCDs are only revised every ten years.
POCDs are not zoning plans.  They are general and aspirational, not site-specific regulatory documents that can or should govern zoning regulation amendments, especially zone by zone, parcel by parcel plans for affordable units.  (That is what the § 8-30j plans were for, before they were repealed.)  Thus, the requirement that housing growth plans must be consistent with the municipality’s POCD creates a structure and process inconsistent with a basic premise of zoning in Connecticut.
Yet another problem: suppose wily opponents of affordable housing revise the municipal POCD by stripping out facilitation of affordable housing? Would the municipality then be free under the new Act from having to adopt any new or revised affordable housing zoning regulations? The point is that the requirement of plans being consistent with POCDs is a blueprint for exclusionary zoning.
Finally, as to regional plans, the notion that regional councils of government will be able to mediate disagreements among member towns about affordable housing goals seems unrealistic, yet the new Act requires this.
Which brings us to the requirement of consistency with the State Conservation and Development Policies Plan, 2025-2030, which includes the infamous Locational Guide Map. The “State C and D Plan” serves many useful purposes, providing an updated compilation of statewide development trends and a list of goals to which state agencies should aspire. But the Plan is not in any way a regulatory document or a land-use or site-specific zoning plan. Its Housing chapter is all of two pages, and contains only a list of general “targets” with which no one would disagree. Therefore, the new Act’s requirement that municipal and regional housing growth plans be consistent with the State Plan is misaligned because the State Plan does not specify land-use requirements with which a local or regional housing plan could conform.
Which leads us to ask whether the intent of this consistency requirement is to convert the Locational Guide Map into a type of statewide land-use control. 
The State Plan and the Map formally apply when a state agency invests more than $200,000 in a “growth-related project,” but the Locational Guide Map is a color-coded depiction of the entire state that identifies “Activity Zones” (Major Urban, Regional, Local, Suburban and Rural) and steers state agency actions away from “Conversation Factors” such as wetlands, farmlands, aquifers, “critical habitats,” and similar characteristics. 
Our concern is that OPM, or affordable housing opponents, will try to use the Locational Guide Map as a statewide zoning map by declaring that multi-family and affordable housing proposed outside an Activity Zone is not consistent with the State Plan.
Our state agencies have tried this before. In 2005, the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and OPM assembled a plan in which the Locational Guide Map contained three shades of green – vast areas of land in dozens of municipalities – and the state DEEP decreed that it would not grant low-interest loans of federal Clean Water Act funds for any proposed sewer extension or expansion that would serve an area colored any shade of green on the Locational Guide Map. 
Since, as noted above, sewers are usually essential for multi-family and affordable housing, DEEP essentially installed itself at a statewide multi-family housing supervisor. When this became apparent, housing advocates and the development community convinced the legislature that this was a misuse of the State Plan and Map and in 2013, the legislature revised both specifying these documents should govern prioritization of certain state funds, but not be a statewide, top-down land use plan. The new Act appears to reenact the earlier regime.
Yet another dysfunction is the requirement that housing growth plans be consistent with local sewer plans.  Under state law, the sole job of water pollution control authorities (sewer commissions) is to manage capacity and engineering in the public sewer system.  Our courts have held in several cases that sewer commissions may not use sewers to control or enforce land use and zoning; that is the exclusive purview of the zoning commission.  For example, a town may not set parcel-by-parcel sewer gallonage limits as a way to prevent anything other than single-family homes on each parcel.
Like the other three consistency requirements in the new Act, sewer plan consistency is a roadmap for exclusionary land use. 
A good example is the fact that the Town of East Lyme recently enacted a three-year moratorium, extendable, on all new sewer connections that will use more than 20,000 gallons per day. This effectively prohibits anything other than small residential development until at least 2028. So does East Lyme now have no obligation to facilitate multi-family housing, because its sewer commission has adopted a plan blocking such housing for the foreseeable future? Is this what the governor and the General Assembly had in mind when they framed the new Act around the phrase “Towns take the lead?”
Another important question: how will drafters of housing growth plans determine whether their plan is consistent with all four touchstones, and what will they do if the state and local POCDs and sewer plans conflict with each other, which is highly likely?
In summary, the sections of the new Act that require municipal and regional housing growth plans to be consistent with the town and regional POCD, the State Plan and local sewer plans contravene existing law and practice. They will be unlikely to facilitate affordable housing production.
Fair share
Interestingly, when what is now the Act was reintroduced in November, proponents of the “fair share” provisions of H.B. 5002 claimed that the new Act preserved key elements of the May-June 2025 proposal, while some others claimed that fair share had been removed.
The new Act contains echoes of fair share, but removes the mandates that towns enact zoning regulations that will facilitate the highly prescriptive affordable housing unit and household income targets stated in H.B. 5002. 
The fingerprints of fair share are found in the Act’s Section 7, which requires regional councils to conduct a housing needs assessment and assign to each municipality an “affordable housing goal,” which goal becomes an organizing focus of the municipal and regional housing growth plans. The main difference from the May-June 2025 bill is that municipalities are required only to adopt “strategies” and “policies” and a schedule, but with no mandates or deadlines for revising zoning regulations.
Development opportunities
Two foundational questions are: will the General Assembly and the governor actually appropriate the incentive funds and underpin key sections of the new Act? And will municipalities, faced with complete new requirements but not mandates or penalties for non-compliance, actually cooperate? 
Meanwhile, for the development community, the opportunities for 2026 and beyond appear to be:

Take advantage of the new parking rules to increase residential density;
Examine land zoned commercial or mixed-use for opportunities to develop middle housing;
If a municipality proposes a transit-oriented district or priority housing development zone, pay attention to the potential for residential development as-of-right or by summary review;
Continue to use § 8-30g where appropriate;
Continue to work with proven financial and development programs administered by DOH and CHFA, including tax credit and low interest loan programs;
Keep an eye out for CMDA development agreements and opportunities they create; and
Pay attention to grants by OPM and DOH, as they may be an early sign of a development opening.

 A Legislative agenda For 2026
Though legislators may be reluctant to revisit the new Act in the 2026 short session, these problems need attention:

Untangle and simplify the process and schedule for housing growth plans;
Repeal the dysfunctional and illegal “consistency” requirements for such plans;
Modify the nine-unit cap on middle housing developments to a number that will attract developers;
Explain how the CMDA program is intended to fit with the new housing programs;
Clarify the notably confusing phrases, undefined and hard-to-understand terms, and vague standards that permeate the Act;
Clarify roles of municipalities vs. zoning commissions;
Be sure the study committees looking at sewer policies and the § 8-30g Ten Percent List at least do not create new obstacles to affordable housing development; and
Consider (again) the “low-hanging fruit” we have advocated before, which is to require that all zoning regulations by a date certain comply with Public Act 21-29’s amendments to General Statutes § 8-2.

As readers can tell, overall, we are not fans of the new Act. While H.B. 5002 had its flaws that probably justified the governor’s veto, the new Act does not portend robust solutions to our affordable housing shortage. 
The goal remains the approval, financing, and construction of thousands of lower-cost housing units, and that goal appears to be as compelling and unaddressed as it was a year ago.
Tim Hollister and Andrea Gomes are land use attorneys at the Hartford office of Hinckley Allen.  They both work regularly on affordable housing development.  
In 2022-23, Hollister co-chaired a statewide working group tasked by the legislature with reviewing all of the affordable housing plans (so-called “§ 8-30j plans”) prepared by nearly all municipalities and providing recommendations on how such plans could be improved.  In September 2024, he published here a five-part series about affordable housing reform and in July 2025, a two-part series explaining House Bill 5002, the one vetoed by the governor in June 2025, and what could be done to fix it.
Gomes regularly represents clients before local and state agencies and in state court. She has assisted with obtaining municipal approvals and litigating affordable housing matters and property disputes such as quiet title actions, easement disputes, nuisance actions, and adverse possession cases. 
Attorney Raphael Podolsky also contributed to this series.

The torch. The water. The idea that someone was standing at the edge of the country, holding a light, saying you can come in now. It felt settled. Like a promise you weren’t allowed to question.
I didn’t think about it again for a long time. Until Renee Good.
Renee Good is dead. Shot in South Minneapolis. And the news cycle is doing what it always does. It’s eating the corpse.
We keep a woman in the harbor holding a torch and promising refuge. We tell our kids she means something. Then a real woman is killed in the street while trying to protect people with less power than her, and the argument immediately collapses into compliance, procedure, and threat assessment.
The lie tastes like ash in the mouth. Those two images, the bronze promise and the bleeding body, are incompatible. The only way we make them coexist is by lying. To ourselves. To each other. And to the dead.
The Compliance Trap
The reflex is instant.
One side screams “Compliance.” She should have listened. She should have stopped.She used a car as a weapon.
The other side screams “Murder.” Excessive force. Escalation.She was trying to get away.
They argue about split-second tactics. About angles and physics. About the legal definition of fear. They zoom in. Frame by frame. Inch by inch. Not because it leads to truth, but because staying small feels safer.
It lets us cling to the comforting delusion that the system is sound, and only individuals fail.
“Just comply.” It sounds like advice. It sounds reasonable. It sounds like something you’d say to keep yourself safe.
But it isn’t safety advice. It’s an instruction we internalize to accept outcomes we cannot confront. A lullaby for obedience. If you just follow the rules, the teeth of the machine won’t bite you.
But the Statue of Liberty doesn’t have a plaque that says Comply and you will be safe.
It says: Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.
That isn’t a law. It’s a posture. An orientation toward the vulnerable.
Renee Good had that orientation. She stood between the power and the powerless. A shield made of flesh and urgent compassion. And in America, that is the most dangerous place to stand.
The Enemy of the Structure
This isn’t really about whether the agent felt fear. Fear is cheap. Fear is the default operating condition of a militarized system.
This is about the geometry of the state.
The state claims a monopoly on protection. It says: We keep you safe.
But when the state becomes the thing people need to be kept safe from, when it’s the one tearing the family apart, hunting the neighbor, the citizen steps in.
Renee stepped in. She brought a whistle. The state brought a gun.
And the system cannot tolerate that.
It cannot tolerate a mother acting as a shield against a federal operation. It creates a logic error. It disrupts the spreadsheet.
Look at the history. Slavery was legal. The people who hid runaways were criminals. Native removal was legal. The people who resisted were savages. Jim Crow was legal. The marchers were agitators. Kent State was legal. The students were threats.
Every time, the argument is the same: They should have listened. They broke the order. They didn’t comply.
We love the idea of a protector. We build statues to them. We write movies about them. But in practice, in the street. we shoot them.
The Erasure
The tragedy isn’t only that she died. The tragedy is what happens next.
By focusing on compliance, we turn a moral act into a tactical failure. We turn a woman who loved her community into a suspect who disobeyed a command. We erase the why and obsess over the how.
We erase her courage and replace it with a police report.
That’s the move. That’s always the move. Make it technical. Make it legal. Make it procedural.
Don’t let anyone talk about the heart. Don’t let anyone talk about the fact that she died trying to keep a family together. Because if we talk about that, we have to look back at the woman in the harbor. We have to read those words again: Yearning to breathe free.
And we have to admit something we don’t want to face.
If the Lady in the Harbor stepped off her pedestal today, if she stood in the street in Minneapolis, torch in hand, between agents and the huddled masses, if she stood between power and the fragile, they’d probably shoot her too.
And the news would say she should have just dropped the torch.
The geometry is brutal. Point A: the promise carved in copper. Point B: the body on the asphalt. The line connecting them is straight and thin and soaked in contradiction.
We keep pretending the line doesn’t exist. We keep calling the space between the points tragic instead of broken.
But the dead don’t get to pretend. And neither should we.

Richard Blumenthal both issued  press releases on January 9,  expressing the outrage most of us feel at the actions of ICE  and President Donald Trump.
They called for an independent investigation of the shooting of American citizen Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis and also of how and why a demonstrator was struck by a federal vehicle at a peaceful demonstration I attended the next day at the Federal Building in Hartford.
In a democracy rooted in law, everyone’s actions must be lawful.  When there is disagreement about what is lawful, there are channels to go through to determine it—courts, state and local governments, arrest warrants, etc. 
Here I’m impressed with Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam’s response to the motor vehicle incident and the pepper-spraying of protestors last Thursday night: “We will be investigating what appears to be a hit-and-run incident by what appears to be a governmental employee as we would any other hit-and-run incident.”
Any of us can express outrage and call for investigations and resignations, but we expect more from our elected officials.
Larson’s co-sponsoring of the No Secret Police Act is a start, but just a start. His and Sen. Blumenthal’s presence at that rally would’ve been an enormous shot-in-the-arm for the protest and this movement.
They, not we, have the power to introduce bills and gather support from their  colleagues in Congress. The FY 2026 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill is being used by some of their colleagues as leverage to demand ICE reforms. We need them to support such demands.
Our own Sen. Chris Murphy is planning to introduce legislation requiring ICE agents to have warrants, prevent them from wearing masks during arrests and limit their use of firearms.
Larson and Blumenthal need to lend their support or co-sponsor. They have the bully pulpit to rally us to action —in the streets, at work, at town council meetings —to maximize whatever power we individuals do have.
I’ve heard them both using it at gatherings at the Capitol. We need them to lead us at this time. At this point in their careers, we need them to be the leaders their constituents and our country need them to be.

That was until a Dollar General opened a stone’s throw away. Within months, we sank. 
Middletown is known for its plethora of small businesses. With more and more towns growing indistinguishable from each other, all littered with a combination of the same regional and national chains, small businesses are becoming a rare asset. 
Everyone who has ever gone to the same mom-and-pop shop over any length of time knows that they are more than a place to buy milk, snacks, and lotto tickets. It feels almost impossible to see the same faces behind the counter and not somehow learn about their family vacation next month, or the storm coming on the weekend, or about a car robbery that happened to their neighbor – who lives near you, so you better be careful! 



I grew up sitting behind the counter while my dad chatted with seemingly every single person who came up to him. Whether they were wealthy widows who liked to treat themselves to chocolate and cigars now and again or a group of boys coming in from Xavier down the street, my dad knew them all. As a teen who was constantly on her phone, being at the store was one of my most cherished points of connection with my real-life community. I think at a time when everything we need can be delivered almost magically to our doors, these casual, nothing conversations can mean more to us than we thought possible. I’d only noticed once they were gone.
My family’s story is not unique. In fact, one out of every 20 independent grocery stores will go out of business within a few years of a dollar store arriving in their area. With the booming rate at which dollar stores have been expanding, many small businesses are facing the repercussions multiple times over. The opening of big box stores has always been challenging for small businesses, but the rapid growth and unpredictability of dollar stores pose another threat entirely.

Aida Sherwani

Due to competition within different dollar store chains (ie, Family Dollar, which owns Dollar Tree, versus Dollar General), it is hard to know when a Family Dollar will open and sink a Dollar General; ergo, it is hard to know whether a small business should ride out the storm or jump ship. Recently, 1,000 Dollar Tree-owned stores have been set to close; meanwhile, Dollar General forecasts net sales to grow between 3.7% and 4.7% by the end of January 2026. One thing is certain, though, families like mine are having their livelihoods washed away by these mega-chain corporations. 
Some places have legislation against dollar stores. In 2020, the city of Manvel, Texas, adopted an ordinance that prohibits the building of new dollar stores within two miles of another dollar store, convenience store, or gas station. Furthermore, in 2019, the city of Stonecrest, Georgia, adopted a total ban on new dollar stores. These are concrete examples of municipal governments putting their people before their profits. Similar ordinances have been adopted in Connecticut as well. East Hartford adopted an ordinance prohibiting a new dollar store from opening within 2,000 feet of another dollar store. In my research, I have found 28 cities that have adopted similar ordinances on dollar stores. The progress is limited, but real. 
Despite this, both Dollar Tree and Dollar General have forecasted an increase in profits, and with that will come expansions into more typically lower-income areas, like where I live, stealing money from the community, because that is what they are doing. Dollar General failed more than 4,300 government price-accuracy inspections in 23 states since January 2022, while Family Dollar failed 2,100 price inspections in 20 states. At the counter, instead of telling you about a sister getting married in the spring, they are charging you a price that wasn’t on the shelf and pretending not to notice.
Now, I completely understand that a stranger telling you to bypass your cheapest, most widespread convenience store option may sound out of touch and too demanding. As a low-income person myself, I understand the benefits of dollar stores. I only ask you to think twice before you patronize one. 
As for legislators, I continue to advocate for laws that will keep small businesses afloat. An ordinance limiting chain dollar stores would preserve the charms many CT towns are known for, my hometown of Middletown especially, as well as protect their residents. Supporting small businesses is key to creating strong community bonds, and that may be worth more than the convenience of a dollar store.

One number he won't fret over: The state's eight congressional districts, which he insists will not be redrawn.","Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) discusses upcoming 2026 session in his office Monday. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)The 2026 legislative session will be primarily about the numbers for Senate President Bill Ferguson.
The Baltimore City Democrat enters his seventh session as leader of the Senate. His chamber will have the first crack at Gov. Wes Moore’s last budget of the term, and its projected $1.5 billion deficit.
But one number Ferguson will likely not focus on is the state’s eight congressional districts. Despite pressure from the governor and the House ro redraw the districts mid-cycle, the Senate leader has staked out opposition to the move, and says now it’s too late to act even if a bill lands in the General Assembly on opening day.
“I think we’re still at the same place,” Ferguson told Maryland Matters when asked if the Senate had changed its position on the issue. “And I’d say I think the window is closed. The filing deadline [for candidates] is Feb. 24, the attorney general said it’s at least 120 days to prepare for a case at the trial court level.”
Ferguson sits on a five-member redistricting advisory commission appointed by Moore. After several virtual meetings late last year, the panel considered nearly three-dozen maps Friday, and could make a recommendation when it meets again this Friday.
Any legislation that stems from that is likely to come from the House. Ferguson has been clear that his chamber would not take up the issue this close to the election, and any bill that makes it out of the House could land in the legislative purgatory of the Senate Rules Committee.
House Speaker Peña-Melnyk begins first session tackling budget deficit, immigration policy

Ferguson said a bill at this late stage would “significantly impact the election.”
“I think we’ve already missed the window,” Ferguson said.
For Ferguson, the 2026 session begins what he called his “third chapter” as presiding officer: First with former House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County), then with Jones and Moore, and now with Moore and new Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel).
“I keep saying this is chapter three, and I’m hopeful it’ll be the best chapter yet,” Ferguson said.
“I would say we probably likely agree on most issues and the outcome of most issues,” he said Monday. “it’s the means of getting there.”
One of those issues — perhaps the biggest issue — will be the budget.
The legislature wrapped the 2025 session believing a package of one-time fund shifts, cuts and $1.6 billion in tax increases had erased a $3.3 billion deficit and left them with a projected $300 million surplus for the fiscal 2027 budget. Instead, lawmakers start the year staring at a projected $1.5 billion budget gap.
“I don’t think any of us expected us to be in the place where we are, but due to the federal uncertainty, to Medicaid costs, health care inflation, we’re back in a place where we have to do some heavy lifting to balance the budget,” Ferguson said.
“I don’t foresee us doing any revenues for it,” he said. “I think we’re going to have to really cost-contain wherever possible. We’re going to have to look deeply into the formulas to find places where we can adjust and moderate the growth that we’ve seen.”
Maryland has been the state hardest hit by the elimination of federal jobs, losing nearly 25,000 since Trump took office, according to the most recent figures.
That’s in addition to inflationary pressures and increasing costs of health care and services for persons with developmental disabilities, where Ferguson said there are “700 individuals in Maryland that account for $400 million worth of spending.”
“That’s a half a million dollars of spending annually on an individual, 700 individuals … in the developmental disabilities community, where the Marylanders with the highest needs,” he said. “That is a lot, it sounds like a lot of money, but if it allows them to have a life, to be able to have basic care, you know, that is a commitment that we in Maryland have made.”
But the Senate leader warned of tough choices ahead.

“It will crowd out other priorities,” he said. “We will balance the budget. There is only so much you can push in any direction, and so it is entitlement spending. So, if somebody is eligible, then we spend it.”
Changes are possible when it comes to eligibility.
“I think we are going to be adjusting our eligibility alongside of what was required with the Republican budget bill, we have to figure out how Maryland will adapt and adjust to that,” Ferguson said. “We anticipate that a number of Medicaid-eligible individuals are likely to be kicked off the rolls.”
In the short term, there’s a savings, he said. But eventually, the costs escalate as those who fall below the eligibility guidelines delay health care, show up in emergency rooms or stay longer in hospitals to treat severe illnesses.
“That’s the most expensive kind of care,” Ferguson said. “And so I think that’s why these decisions have to be looked at, not just on a year-by-year basis. It’s what is the net impact overall of policies that are underpinning a lot of the costs.”
Ferguson said the legislature will also have to focus again on broader affordability issues, including the costs of electricity and policies meant to decrease housing costs.
“It’s going to be very similar to what we said last year. It’s going to be short term, midterm, long term,” Ferguson said of efforts to rein in utility bills. “In short term, the rebates were an important feature for twice a year to provide immediate relief for people in the hardest-hit months in the winter and then … in the summer.”
The Senate leader said he expects the legislature to consider additional subsidies for electric bills. He did not provide specifics but said the money for the payments could come again from the Strategic Energy Investment Fund, which is typically used for energy efficiency projects.
Some of the funds will also be used to backfill cuts made to federal programs for wind, solar and battery projects. If those projects get knocked off schedule, he said, it will mean less power generation, “which will increase the cost of electricity overall.”
With another budget deficit in Maryland, Republicans see an opportunity

“The long term is really to continue to push for generation here in Maryland, and that is with cleaner sources than exist today,” he said. So, if it’s coal — we want to get rid of coal — we’ve got to do it in a way that is cleaner and affordable.
“And so, in some cases, we’ll see a transition to natural gas. In other places, we’ll see expansion of opportunity around nuclear,” he said. “I think we’ll see big investments in batteries and renewables, and so we need it cleaner than what exists today.”
Ferguson said he also expects to take up legislation to counter some other federal policies including immigration enforcement. One of those bills — Senate Bill 1 – would prohibit law enforcement officers, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, from using masks to obscure their faces.
“I think that … the way that we’ve seen these operations be conducted in Maryland and across the country is absolutely abhorrent and is horrifying and shocks the conscience for I hope, the vast, vast, vast majority of American people who do not want to be living amongst a paramilitary enforcement of the law,” Ferguson said.
A second bill would ban 287(g) agreements between local police departments and federal immigration enforcement.
“We’ll do what we can at a state level,” he said. “I think that ICE has become an institution that has severely lost its way, and Maryland law enforcement, by partnering with ICE at this point, is only creating further distrust between law enforcement and the population that employ them.”

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)The Maryland Democratic Party’s annual luncheon, hosted the day before the start of the legislative session, typically serves as a rally for the party faithful and a chance for party leaders to lay out possible trials and tribulations during the next 90 days.
This year, however,  there was also a sense of reflection, as Democrats paid tribute to two notable figures taking their leave from their current positions and reflected on challenges in the recent past and near future.
New House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) paid tribute to her predecessor, former Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County), whom she honored as a trailblazer. Jones was unable to attend the Tuesday event.
“Speaker Adrienne Jones opened those doors for many of us. And she’s a transformative leader, someone who was unapologetic and has left an impressive legacy,” Peña-Melnyk said. “Someone whose shoes I can’t fill, but she left them in the right direction for me.”
The luncheon also served as a light send-off for Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th), who announced last week that he would not seek reelection this year after almost 45 years in Congress and almost 60 years in state politics.
List of possible Hoyer successors continues to grow, with more ‘definitely considering’

“I rise before you to look across this room and know that there are very few, if any, here who were alive when I was elected … some 60 years ago,” Hoyer said, drawing chuckles from the room. But Hoyer also warned the crowd that state lawmakers are going to have a challenging year wrangling the state budget deficit and policy moves from the Trump administration.
After dealing with a $3.3 billion budget shortfall last year, lawmakers return this year facing another looming deficit, this time to the tune of $1.5 billion. Meanwhile, federal policies out of the Trump administration threaten to disrupt policy goals for Maryland Democrats.
Peña-Melnyk, addressing the event for the first time as speaker, highlighted the legislative challenges that she and state lawmakers will face during session, ranging from rising energy costs to the anticipated loss of Medicaid coverage as a result of federal changes, on top of the budget challenge.
But she assured that she would hold her own as speaker, with the help of her colleagues.
“Trust me, I am not an idealist – that young delegate that came in 20 years ago. No, I am more pragmatic now,” she said. “But you’re not going to take that fire and hope and faith out of me.”
She also thanked the delegates that pulled out of the race for the speaker position last month, recognizing House Appropriations Chair Ben Barnes (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel), Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles) and Del. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery), who she said were “also very deserving” of the serving as speaker, but had “the grace to withdraw their names, so that I could go forward.”
“This race was intense, but it was respectful and it was civil,” she said. “It takes a lot for you to withdraw your name when you are also very deserving and have done the work, and I thank you for believing in me.”
Under her leadership, Peña-Melnyk said the House would embrace the challenge with respect and civility, working alongside the Maryland Senate and the Moore administration.
“Is it going to be easy, the work we’re about to do? No it isn’t,” she said. “We have a deficit. People are struggling, but I know we can talk and sit down.”
While Peña-Melnyk looked to the immediate future, Gov. Wes Moore (D) looked inward, offering self-reflection on the three years of hi first term — proud of the progress made, while acknowledging that things didn’t always go as planned.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) promised to take the lessons learned over the last three years as governor to “be better” in the last year of his first term. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)
“I cannot sit here and tell you all that I know I have gotten it all right,” he said. “I can tell you on the places I haven’t gotten it all right — I am never going to stop getting better.
“I am never going to miss an opportunity to grow, miss an opportunity to push, miss an opportunity to test myself … miss an opportunity to do something that we believe, even if it’s by a margin, it’s going to make the lives of the people of the state better,” he said.
Heading into the session, Moore said he is grateful for the “mistakes” and “lessons learned,” though he did not offer specifics.
“For this moment, I’m grateful for the trials, I’m grateful for the tribulations,” Moore told the gathered Democrats. “I’m grateful for the lessons learned. I’m grateful for the mistakes. I’m grateful for the heartaches. I’m grateful for the things I know I can’t take back.
“Because all of them are not just what makes us human, it’s what makes us better. And being better is exactly what the people of this state deserve,” Moore said.
Abrupt end
But the reflections were abruptly cut off by the end of the luncheon. Due to speakers running over their allotted time throughout the event, the lineup needed to be shuffled to accommodate Moore’s departure, as he was operating on a tight schedule Tuesday.
Moore was originally scheduled to speak last, but state Democratic Chair Steuart Pittman moved the governor ahead of both Comptroller Brooke Lierman and Lt. Governor Aruna Miller’s scheduled speaking slot.
About a third of the attendees walked out after Moore’s comments, leaving before Miller could highlight some of the high points of the past year, which included drops in violent crime rates in Baltimore and new companies investing in the state. After Miller, Pittman announced that the event was out of time and shut it down before Lierman was able to speak.

Steny Hoyer (D-5th) was lauded at the annual Maryland Democrats' pre-session luncheon Tuesday for his decades of service. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Less than a week after longtime Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) announced he will not seek re-election to the seat he’s held for 45 years, the list of candidates hoping to replace him is growing — and could continue to do so.
The eight candidates who were already filed with the Maryland State Board of Elections last week gained a ninth Tuesday, when Republican Michelle Talkington, who unsuccessfully challenged Hoyer in 2024, filed her candidacy paperwork with the board.
His paperwork was not in Tuesday, but Del. Adrian Boafo (D-Prince George’s) announced Monday that he’s in the race for the 5th District seat. He already had a congressional campaign website that claimed he had raised $100,000 in one day and garnered 14 endorsements.
And that doesn’t include the other state lawmakers and former congressional candidates who said this week they are “definitely considering” the possibility of a run.
Political analysts predicted the Democratic primary would be crowded, with the winner of it almost certain of a general election victory in the district, where there were 2.5 registered Democrats for every registered Republican in 2024. The district includes the three Southern Maryland counties of Calvert, Charles and St. Mary’s with portions or Prince George’s and Anne Arundel counties.
Analysts also said they expect voters in the district would choose a more progressive Democratic nominee in the June 23 primary than the more-moderate Hoyer.
Boafo said Tuesday that he is optimistic about the race, which he said is about “the next chapter for this district.”
“It’s about new generation of leadership,” said Boafo, 31, who worked as a campaign manager for Hoyer between 2019 and 2021. “This is a five-month sprint, so we only have a short amount of time. We got to get out there and see where we go from here.”
Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles) — one of the “definitely considering” candidates — stressed Tuesday that whether it’s him or someone else, the person seeking the office must have “the people of the district in mind.”
“It just can’t be people who just want to be in political office,” Wilson said. “It’s important [that] whoever we have in office realizes that. It’s a huge concern of mine we just start attracting a lot of politicians, and their claim to fame is politics. Tell me what you have done. I’m hoping that somebody has that kind of dignity to make sure they’re running for the right reasons.”
Other “strongly considering” candidates include Sen. Arthur Ellis (D-Prince George’s) and former U.S. Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who ran unsuccessfully for the 3rd District seat in 2024. While Dunn lives in the 8th District, congressional candidates in Maryland are not required to live in the district they’re seeking.
Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s), who chairs the county’s House delegation, reiterated from last week she’s giving “strong consideration” to run. Williams said she’ll decide in about a week.
In addition to Talkington, a Charles County resident, there are five Democrats, two unaffiliated candidates and another Republican currently filed for the seat, according to the board of elections. One of those Democrats, retired Navy officer Terry Jackson, said over the weekend that Hoyer’s decision to step down opens the field.
“No one should be anointed. This open seat levels the playing field, and voters deserve a race decided on merit—not inevitability or insider assumptions,” said Jackson, who filed his candidacy in October.
Hoyer, who said Thursday that he would likely recommend a successor at some point, said that Tuesday was not that time.
When asked a possible endorsement as he left the Maryland Democratic Party’s annual legislative lunch, where fellow Democrats heaped praise on him for his service, Hoyer would only say, “I’m not going to do anything right now.”

Hubner, a Catonsville resident, owned and developed real estate around the turn of the century. He served both in the House and Senate — and served as both speaker and, several years later, as Senate President, according to a Maryland State Archives biographical sketch.
The sketch did not list his birthplace. But an obituary in the Baltimore Sun and a copy of his death certificate issued on Sept. 8, 1920, did note his place of birth as Bavaria, Germany — an immigrant to the U.S. The state Department of Legislative Services Library helped confirm the research.
Jack Derr, senator from Frederick, dies
Former Sen. John W. “Jack” Derr, who represented Frederick and Washington counties, has died.
“Jack was an always pleasant, soft spoken, and respected legislator during his entire 16 years in the Maryland Senate,” said Marty Madden, a former state senator. “This demeanor made him an extremely effective advocate for his constituents in Frederick and Washington counties. Jack bought goodwill to all sides regardless of the issue. Both Annapolis and Washington could use more Jack Derrs.”
Derr died Jan. 7  in Park Rapids, Minnesota, where he and his wife had a retirement home. No cause of death was released. He was 84.
He was born in Frederick in 1941. He attended Frederick High School and in 1963 earned a bachelor’s degree from the University of Maryland, College Park. He also served in the U.S. Army Reserves from 1963-1969.
Derr, a Republican, was elected to the Senate in 1982 and served four terms — all on the Senate Economic and Environmental Affairs Committee. He also served as Senate Minority Whip from 1996-1999 when he left the Senate.
Derr is survived by his wife Joy and the couple’s four children: David J. Derr (Martha) of Gig Harbor, Washington; Elizabeth Derr Schultz (Matthew) of Anchorage, Alaska; Andrew M. Derr (Kelly) of Middletown; Amy Derr Hodges (John) of Bristow, Virginia; and 15 grandchildren.
Funeral services are planned for noon Eastern time at Hubbard United Methodist Church. The service will be livestreamed from Park Rapids.
Bryant appointed to elections role

Gov. Wes Moore on Tuesday named Eric Bryant to fill the seat on the Maryland State Board of Elections vacated by Yaakov “Jake” Weissmann when he left to become the state’s budget secretary last fall.
Bryant most recently served as chief of staff for Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-7th), but has “more than three decades of experience in law, government, and elective politics,” according to a statement from the governor’s office.
“Eric Bryant’s career has been defined by a deep understanding of the law and an unwavering commitment to the democratic process,” Moore said in the statement. “He brings a rare perspective that combines technical legal expertise with a lifelong dedication to civil rights. Eric is the right public servant to ensure Maryland’s elections remain fair and free.”
Moore’s office said Bryant’s experience in local, state, and federal campaigns “give him practical experience with the election laws of Maryland, the Maryland State Board of Elections, federal elections law, and the Federal Election Commission.” He has worked for years on voter re-enfranchisement, as well as on an update to state elections regulations so that they kept pace with digital advertising.
Before working with Mfume, Bryant spent 14 years as a partner with Rifkin Weiner Livingston LLC. He also worked as a national office staffer with the NAACP, working on an array of civil rights issues, including large-scale voter registration drives and voter re-enfranchisement efforts. He called the nomination to the elections board “a humbling honor.”
“As a product of the civil rights movement, the principle of ‘one person, one vote’ is more than a slogan to me, it is a moral imperative. I look forward to serving the board with purpose and integrity to ensure Maryland continues to have transparent, free and fair elections,” he said, according to the governor’s statement.
Bryant earned his law degree from the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law and his bachelor’s degree from Duke University.
Two new judges for Montgomery, Prince George’s circuit courts
Apparently, it’s appointments week in Annapolis, in addition to being the opening week of the 2026 General Assembly.
Moore appoints three to fill vacant House seats, Hoover steps back at PSC, in political notes

Moore on Tuesday elevated Montgomery County District Court Judge Victor Manuel Del Pino to the circuit court bench in the county and announced the appointment of Joseph C. Ruddy, a lawyer in the Prince George’s County Office of Law, to a seat on the Prince George’s Circuit Court.
“The Montgomery County and Prince George’s County Circuit Courts are gaining two exceptional legal professionals who have dedicated their lives to advancing justice under the law,” Moore said in a statement released by his office. “These public servants bring a wealth of legal experience, and I am grateful for their continued service to our state.”
Del Pino has been a district court judge since 2019, and before that was in private practice for nine years with McGann, Del Pino and Hughes. He was a prosecutor in the Montogomery County State’s Attorney’s Office for seven years, including two years as chief of the Gang Prosecution Unit. He also served two terms on the board of trustees of the Maryland Public Defender’s Office. A lifelong resident of Montgomery County, he is fluent in Spanish. He is set to begin teaching this year the Georgetown University School of Law, and earned his law degree from the University of Baltimore School of Law.
Ruddy has been with the Prince George’s County Office of Law for seven years, where he has been legal adviser for the county police since June. Before that, he spent more than six years as deputy county attorney, where he provided legal guidance to all county agencies, including the County Council. Roddy was a prosecutor for 15 years in the Prince George’s County State’s Attorney’s Office, and served early in his career as a clerk to Prince George’s County Circuit Judge Ronald D. Schiff. He has been a course instructor for multiple police departments, covering topics that include the Fourth Amendment and expert testimony, and earned his law degree from the Catholic University of America.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/state-house-flag-newsletter-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-13 22:59:06.559535

“It’s a very humbling thing. I’m very excited. I’m very grateful that the residents of district 63 have elected me as their representative and House District 63 and I’m looking forward to going to work for them,” he said.
Crow’s platforms included improving public education and maintaining a business-friendly environment.
Democratic candidate Judith Taylor said in an interview Tuesday evening that despite her loss, she feels confident in the votes she got.
“First time out of the box, and I got half of what a seasoned, polished professional politician got,” Taylor said.
Crow raised $134,779 and spent $26,784. Many of his cash donations came from Political Action Committees (PACs) and businesses.
According to campaign finance records, Taylor raised $14,410 and spent $5,446. All of her cash donations came from individuals.
The seat became vacant after former Rep. Cynthia Almond, R-Tuscaloosa, resigned following her appointment as president of the Alabama Public Service Commission last June.
The district has been solidly Republican since 1998, when former Rep. Tim Parker switched from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party. The seat was held by Robert Bentley, later the governor of Alabama, from 2002 to 2010. Rep. Bill Poole, R-Tuscaloosa, got 63% of the vote in 2010 and did not face any competition in 2014 or 2018. Almond got 66% of the vote in her last election in 2022.

Enrollment for 2026 fell in Wisconsin and nationwide as premium costs rose and enhanced subsidies ended at the end of 2025.With premium costs sharply increased and enhanced subsidies to reduce them no longer available, the number of people signing up for health care in the federal marketplace is behind last year by more than 5%, according to a preliminary report.
The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid, which manages the HealthCare.gov enrollment, reported this week that Wisconsin enrollment fell by more than 17,000 below 2025’s record enrollment, which topped 310,000. As of Jan. 3, 289,213 Wisconsin residents had enrolled in plans for 2026.
HealthCare.gov is the marketplace created as part of the Affordable Care Act. It is a platform for people to purchase health insurance who aren’t covered by an employer or by some other health plan, such as Medicare or Medicaid.
Nationwide, enrollment for 2026 is 22.77 million, CMS reported — a decline of about 1.5 million from 2025.
The loss of enhanced premium tax credits, which cut the cost of health insurance purchased at HealthCare.gov, has been predicted to lead many to drop out of the marketplace. The enhanced subsidies expired at the end of 2025. Smaller subsidies remain in place, but premiums have also risen in cost, for several reasons.
According to insurance analysts, one factor in that increase was that insurance companies expected the higher prices to drive some people out of the marketplace — particularly those with fewer health concerns who are willing to take the chance that they won’t need coverage.
The remaining population is expected to have more serious health needs, making their care more expensive but also raising the cost for insuring the entire remaining pool of customers.
The U.S. House has passed a bill that would extend the enhanced subsidies another three years. Its future in the U.S. Senate isn’t clear.
Open enrollment through HealthCare.gov is still available until Thursday, Jan. 15, with coverage starting Feb. 1. For consumers who enrolled by Dec. 15, 2025, coverage began Jan. 1.

Jan. 13, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceA union-backed auto worker at Ford Motor Co. was caught on video heckling President Donald Trump when he visited a Dearborn factory on Tuesday ahead of his address to the Detroit Economic Club. The video that has now gone viral shows Trump responded in kind by mouthing an expletive at the worker, twice, and displaying a middle finger as he walked away.
Now, the union says the worker has been suspended while Ford looks into the matter.
A representative from the UAW told Michigan Advance that they could confirm that he was suspended but the length of the suspension was unknown. The union was also uncertain about the process that would follow to investigate the matter.
A message seeking comment from Ford to confirm if the worker was fired or suspended was not immediately returned on Tuesday evening.
In a statement to the Advance, White House communications director Steven Cheung called the worker “a lunatic” who was “wildly screaming expletives in a complete fit of rage.”
“And the president gave an appropriate and unambiguous response,” Cheung said.
U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) said she spoke to a well placed source in the worker’s local union who said he was facing disciplinary action.
“Ford said they can’t talk about it because it’s a human resources issue,” Tlaib said. “In the past, when President Obama (went) onto the plant floor and other times people have said some terrible things, they didn’t get fired.”

@michiganadvance #trump #epsteinfiles @Distillsocial ♬ Quiet Music – Stacey Barelos


U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) also told the Advance that the union confirmed that the confrontation meant the man was facing disciplinary action.
Dingell also said she was inquiring with Ford about the status of the man’s employment, and if he was being suspended and investigated in violation of his free speech rights.
“When you’re on a factory floor with union members that have strong feelings, you need to be prepared for whatever they’re gonna say, and I hope they’re not firing him because I believe in free speech,” Dingell said in an interview. “The UAW worker was expressing his right to free speech, and I’m asking questions as to what has happened.”
The video, which was first published by Distill Social shows Trump walking around a raised portion of the Dearborn F-150 plant when the worker, who is not seen on screen, yells to Trump and calls him a “pedophile protector,” a reference to Trump’s widely reported connections to deceased pedophile and sex trafficker Jeffery Epstein and the Trump administration’s bungling of a new law that ordered the FBI to release all of the files that the department had available to them.
Some have seen the constant delays from the FBI and the slow walk to release the files as Trump protecting either himself or his wealthy elite friends from scrutiny or a clear connection to Epstein.
In response to the confrontation, the Democratic National Committee denounced Trump for being “more concerned with his ego than his spiraling economy, where job cuts are skyrocketing, hiring has slowed, unemployment remains high, and prices continue to soar.”
“As working families struggle to make ends meet in Trump’s economy, the Trump family and their wealthy donors keep getting richer — there’s no bigger ‘F-you’ than that,” said DNC Senior Advisor for Messaging, Mobilization and Strategy Tim Hogan in a statement. “The real question is: Why does the mere mention of Epstein set him off?”
Tlaib echoed that point.
“The worker could have said anything, but this worker felt compelled to say you’re protecting a pedophile. I feel very strongly that Ford Motor Company is sending a message that people can’t stand up for sexual abuse survivors,” Tlaib said.

The victory by Pemberton would continue the unbroken streak of Democratic victories in the 139th House District of Ledyard, Montville and Norwich since its creation after the 1990 census. 
With about a 2-1 margin of victory at the polls, Pemberton had a lead that could not be overcome by the early-voting ballots that were last to be counted, Democrats said. The majority of those ballots were cast by Democrats.
Pemberton was opposed by Republican Brandon Sabbag of Ledyard and a write-in candidate, Mark Adams of Norwich, in a special election called after the death of Rep. Kevin Ryan of Montville, a Democrat who first won the seat in 1992.
Unofficial results later posted on the secretary of the state’s elections site showed Pemberton carrying all three towns, with 64% of the vote; Sabbag had 28% and Adams, 7%. Turnout was 20%.
With Pemberton’s victory, the House will return to full strength, with Democrats once again holding a 102-49 super majority.
Sabbag’s campaign was hit by the disclosure Monday by The Day of New London that he had a criminal record, with convictions for misdemeanor assault and felony witness tampering in 2018.
Pemberton is a political newcomer, encouraged to run by state Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, whose district is home to the state’s two federally recognized tribes, the Mohegans and Mashantucket Pequots.
Until recently, Pemberton was an unaffiliated voter.
He and his wife are the parents of two children. They live in the Uncasville section of Montville, which was named by British colonists for their military ally, the Mohegan sachem Uncas.
There is one issue unresolved by the election: a pending lawsuit by Adams over his exclusion from the ballot.
Adams, the Republican nominee in 2022 and 2024, was endorsed in the special election by the Independent Party and claims the secretary of the state’s office wrongly refused to accept his Independent Party nomination papers over a technicality — a missing signature. 
Should he succeed, the remedy could be a new election.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CT4A2940_-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-13 21:57:39.825449
