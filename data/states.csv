(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Federal immigration authorities intensified a weekslong operation in the Twin Cities over the weekend following the Wednesday killing of Renee Nicole Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross.
Residents pushed back, led by a growing network of rapid responders hounding U.S. ICE and Border Patrol vehicles and agents across the metro area.
Thousands marched peacefully in Minneapolis Saturday to remember Good and protest the Trump administration’s expanding immigration crackdown. Many marchers stopped to pay their respects as the procession moved from Powderhorn Park past the intersection where the fatal shooting occurred.
Saturday’s protest, the largest since Good’s killing, was more subdued than a Friday evening gathering outside downtown Minneapolis hotels where ICE agents were said to be staying.
Protesters blew whistles, banged drums and shouted taunts outside the hotels for hours before some tried to force their way into the Canopy by Hilton at 700 Third Street South, causing about $6,000 in damage, the Star Tribune reported. City and state police ordered protesters to disperse around midnight and arrested about 30 people without incident, officials said Saturday.
Near Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, a smaller group braved chilly winds to maintain a near-permanent presence outside an ICE operations hub and detention center.
U.S. Reps.  Ilhan Omar, Angie Craig and Kelly Morrison said they were denied entry to the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building shortly after arriving for what they called an oversight visit on Saturday morning.
Later in the day, Politico reported that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — who oversees ICE and said this weekend she’d ordered hundreds more agents to join at least 2,000 already in the Twin Cities — signed an order on Thursday requiring a week’s notice for Congressional visits to immigrant detention centers.
Multiple people released from Whipple told independent journalists that they’d been verbally or physically abused in or en route to detention there. Two said agents used demeaning language to describe Good and suggested she’d deserved her fate.

The Reformer has not independently verified the Whipple detainees’ claims. In a separate video posted on Sunday by a Minneapolis Reddit user, an ICE agent tells a driver to “[g]o home to your children…have you not learned from what just happened?”
Sunday saw more reports of federal law enforcement activity in St. Paul. One bystander video purported to show agents going “door to door” on Thomas Avenue near Victoria Street, possibly making good on Vice President JD Vance’s promise earlier this week of house-by-house immigration operations. Armed personnel questioned shoppers at a nearby Target. And a crowd heckled agents as they appeared to pull a man out of his car at a gas station on Snelling Avenue.

A multi-agency operation that at times felt like an outright occupation had many Twin Cities residents — not just hardened activists — calling for ICE to withdraw and deeper reform of federal immigration policy.
On Sunday, outgoing U.S. Sen. Tina Smith told CNN that she was listening, but stopped short of promising to lead the “abolish ICE” movement in Washington.
“It is hard for me to imagine how I could vote to support a budget bill for the Department of Homeland Security, given how the Department of Homeland Security is functioning right now in my community,” she said. “I want to see work done that would bring some serious reforms to ICE.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MG_2597-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-12 09:12:09.480705

HOST: Jennifer Smith
GUEST: Lynn Mayor Jared Nicholson; Jennie Williamson, the state director of The Education Trust in Massachusetts; Clark Ziegler, executive director of the Massachusetts Housing Partnership







AS BEACON HILL gears up for the second leg of its two-year legislative cycle, lawmakers are staring down a series of overlapping crises in housing, health care, education, and the state’s financial health generally. Outside and under the Golden Dome, municipalities and advocates have no shortage of suggestions. 
This week on The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon reporter Jennifer Smith hosts a start-of-year roundtable with Lynn Mayor Jared Nicholson; Jennie Williamson, the state director of the research and advocacy organization The Education Trust in Massachusetts; and Clark Ziegler, the outgoing executive director of the Massachusetts Housing Partnership, who is retiring after four decades at the helm of the quasi-public organization.  
All three noted that Beacon Hill seems to recognize the need for action — be it ramping up housing production or addressing the literacy crisis among young people — but “much more work needs to be done” Ziegler said. 
For Zeigler, the past few years included some promising housing swings like the MBTA Communities law and the housing bond bill that legalized accessory dwelling units in single-family zoning areas. At the same time, “the housing trends are really discouraging,” he said, noting that production last year was at a 12-year-low, “so there’s enormous unmet need to promote housing development and to remove barriers to new housing.” 
He points to potential housing legislation in the Senate, which includes recommendations from a Healey task force focused on unlocking housing production – like removing large lot size requirements or parking minimums – as a promising move this term. 
Williamson said the state needs to face that a quality education for most students in Massachusetts is closely tied to where they live and their families’ incomes, with some of the nation’s widest education gaps. 
“I think the broader issue we’re facing here in Massachusetts is that we’re patting ourselves on the back for being number one in education,” she said, “but when you look beyond the state averages, there is a much more complicated and, frankly, troubling story that emerges. And that’s that we’re really only number one for some.” 
Despite investments in K-12 education and a focus on supporting high need students, she said, the outcomes “aren’t improving at the pace we need.” On addressing the state literacy crisis, she said, efforts like providing funds to districts to transition them to so-called “evidence-based reading curriculums,” and a House bill that would require all districts to use those curriculums, are meaningful. 
Even with a supportive gubernatorial administration and local delegation, Nicholson noted, cities are struggling to adequately fund their education systems. 
“One of the big issues that remains to be tackled is municipal revenue and the limitations that municipalities experience trying to provide the services that our residents rely on,” he said, referring to the Proposition 2 1/2 limit on raising municipal taxes over time and “really intense cost pressures” in areas outside of municipal control like pension obligations and health insurance for city employees. 
“There are a lot of good ideas at play — bold ideas at play,” Ziegler said. “We just need to see them through, and that’s where crunch time in a Legislature really matters.”

States have had mixed success in luring jobs and investments with tax abatements, upfront cash and other goodies.  And at least 75% of the time, companies would have made the same location decisions had incentives not been offered, according to research by Tim Bartik, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo.
But rapid technological change, political shifts, market upheavals and outright hostility to major development projects have made putting taxpayer dollars into massive brick-and-mortar factories and data centers an increasingly risky endeavor.
In 2021, Ford announced an $11.4 billion investment—the largest in its history—to build an electric vehicle assembly plant and battery plant in Tennessee and two battery plants in Kentucky in a joint venture with SK Innovation. The complexes were expected to employ 11,000 workers.
But faced with sluggish demand for EVs and a new administration in Washington hostile to clean energy, Ford ditched that strategy in December.
Its Blue Oval City complex in Tennessee is being renamed the Tennessee Truck Center and will build a line of gas-powered pickups there. Ford also dissolved its joint venture with SK Innovation, which will own the Tennessee battery plant.
The automaker is taking sole ownership of the Kentucky battery plants and will use them to produce energy storage systems for rapidly multiply artificial intelligence data centers, utility companies and other large-scale customers.

About 1,500 workers are being laid off from the plants and can reapply for their jobs, angering those workers and some state officials. Kentucky gave Ford a $250 million loan plus the land the plants were built on.
Tennessee handed Ford $1 billion in incentives for the truck and battery plants that were expected to employ nearly 6,000 workers. It’s unclear whether Ford will meet that employment goal.
Prior to announcing its $19.5 billion hit on its EV business, Ford had already cut anticipated employment at its Marshall battery plant from 2,500 jobs to 1,700 positions. Its December announcement said the plant will convert from producing EV batteries to nonautomotive energy storage units.
Stunned by Ford’s 2021 announcement of investments in Tennessee and Kentucky, Michigan quickly enacted the Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve Fund to attract similar projects to the state.
Ford and General Motors Co. were the biggest recipients of funding from the $2 billion SOAR pot for new EV vehicle assembly and battery plants. Those plants have either been sold to their joint venture partners or converted to build gas-powered vehicles.
GM sold its SOAR-supported Lansing battery plant to joint venture partner LG Energy Solution. It abandoned plans to convert its Orion Township assembly plant to EV production. And it recently laid off 1,100 workers at its Factory Zero EV plant in Hamtramck.
On Friday, GM said it would take a $6 billion hit to earnings on its EV business.
Consumer demand for EVs that has fallen far short of expectations is the major reason that automakers are slashing their EV investment. But a radical shift in support for EVs from the
Biden to Trump administrations is a significant factor.
President Joe Biden gave automakers, state governments and consumers billions of dollars in EV incentives in an effort to address climate change and help Detroit catch up to China, which dominates the EV business.

Even Ford CEO Jim Farley has warned that highly advanced Chinese cars “could put us all out of business.”
But President Donald Trump has wiped out much of that assistance, including the elimination of $7,500 consumer tax credits for EV purchases. He claims climate change is “a hoax” and has disparaged Biden’s clean energy agenda as the “green new scam.”
Michigan economic developers also are contending with a backlash by residents against major new-technology projects supported by tax dollars.
Battery maker Gotion pulled the plug on its proposed giant battery plant in Mecosta County last fall following years of controversy about its Chinese parent company and resident concerns about its environmental impact and size of the plant.  Michigan is attempting to claw back $23.7 million in SOAR funding spent on the plant.
There also is heated, widespread opposition by residents to about a dozen proposed hyperscale data centers. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has thrown her support behind a particularly controversial one in Saline Township, saying its construction is a matter of national security and economic competitiveness.
Other elected officials are growing weary of greasing such huge projects that don’t pay off with taxpayer dollars. Lawmakers killed SOAR last year and did not replace it with a new deal-closing fund.
The Upjohn Institute’s Bartik said he thinks the Trump administration’s attack on EVs and other clean energy technologies will be “a blip in history” and that it still makes sense for the state to support the inevitable long-term growth of fossil fuel alternatives. But he acknowledges it’s difficult for such projects to pay off in the current climate.
“In the short run” the market and Trump’s actions “impede investment,” Bartik told me. “The only thing the state can do is strike deals with strong clawback provisions or incentivize projects that can be repurposed for other uses” should they fail.

Days after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a U.S. citizen in Minneapolis, Californians across the state took to the streets to voice their opposition against federal immigration enforcement tactics and President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign.
Over the weekend thousands of demonstrators gathered in Sacramento, San Francisco and the Bay Area, the Central Valley and Southern California including Los Angeles and San Diego in remembrance of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three who was killed during an ICE operation. 
Protests remained largely peaceful, though one demonstration Friday night in Santa Ana led to U.S. Department of Homeland Security officers firing what appeared to be less lethal munitions into a crowd of protesters, according to ABC 7. One officer was reported dragging a protester who was bloodied by the clash, but local police did not report any arrests from that event.
The shooting also came into focus on Saturday during a gubernatorial candidate forum in L.A., reports the Los Angeles Times. During the union-backed event, which included a panel of eight Democrats, U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell said “Ms. Good should be alive today.” 
The Trump administration has maintained that the officer who shot Good feared for his life. The California Republican Party circulated a video of First Assistant U.S. Attorney and former Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli defending ICE’s actions, arguing that “officers are fully justified in using any force they need to protect their lives.”
Good’s killing follows the death of Keith Porter, another American, who was shot and killed on Dec. 31 by an off-duty ICE officer in the L.A. neighborhood of Northridge. 
In response to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, some Democratic state legislators have recently introduced bills to curb ICE activity, including proposals that would limit arrests in courthouses and enable Californians to sue for damages from federal agents — though questions about the measures’ legality and enforcement capabilities remain.

Newsom’s last budget show

Let the bargaining begin. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom’s $349 billion state spending plan is on the table, reports CalMatters’ Yue Stella Yu.
Now all he has to do is get lawmakers on board with proposals that many of them won’t especially like, including consolidating more power of education under his office at the expense of the elected state superintendent; clipping funding for homelessness; and holding the line on health care spending at a time when the Trump administration is overhauling how it pays for Medicaid.
It could work — as long as the AI boom that’s padding state tax revenue keeps going. 
The governor’s budget projects $9 billion more in revenue than anticipated and a “modest” $2.9 billion shortfall for the 2026-27 fiscal year. His proposal also calls for spending almost $30 billion more compared to this year.
The budget plan would fully fund the state’s transitional kindergarten program, provide an additional $715 million combined to its two public university systems and increase special education funding by more than $500 million. 
Funding for other state initiatives, however, would be significantly gutted: Newsom proposed halving a $1 billion infusion for cities and counties’ homelessness services, and cutting $15 billion from the state’s spending that goes toward combatting the effects of climate change.

AI adversaries team up on ballot initiative

A nonprofit organization that advocates for children’s safety online and the artificial intelligence powerhouse OpenAI are teaming up to place a measure on the November ballot that would help protect kids in California from companion chatbots, writes CalMatters’ Khari Johnson.
Common Sense Media and OpenAI, which created ChatGPT, filed a ballot proposal Thursday to mandate various safeguards against chatbots. These include:

Requiring chatbot developers to apply protective settings for people with a predicted age of 17 and younger.
Banning child-targeted advertising and the sale of kids’ data without parental consent.
Preventing AI systems from promoting social isolation or simulating romantic relationships with kids.

The measure reflects a compromise between the two entities, after each planned their own separate and competing ballot initiatives that would have taken different paths toward regulating chatbots. Those proposals had stipulations that the one that got the most “yes” votes would win. 
OpenAI’s measure largely reflected existing law, while the one from Common Sense included proposed regulations that were ultimately dropped in the new ballot initiative, such as a ban on minors from using chatbots capable of engaging in sexually explicit talk.

California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: If the state budget’s projected revenue increase is accurate, Newsom can conclude his governorship with California’s finances no longer plagued by deficits, but the new forecast should be viewed skeptically.
Until insurance companies are held accountable for malfeasance and delays, homeowners who survived the Southern California wildfires will continue to be victimized, writes Richard Rieber, an Altadena resident whose home was damaged in the fire.
As California’s next insurance chief, I pledge to expand the department’s rate review team, modernize its rate regulation bureau and work to decrease the number of FAIR Plan policies, writes Steven Bradford, a former state legislator from Gardena who is running for Insurance Commissioner.

Fire victims are left with delays, gaslighting and denials.","Guest Commentary written by

Richard Rieber
Richard Rieber is an aerospace engineer and Altadena resident whose home was damaged in the fire.


I am an aerospace engineer by trade, but for the last year my second full-time job has been fighting my insurance company. I am one of thousands of Eaton Fire survivors caught in a second disaster — not in the canyons, but in the fine print. 
After the tragic Eaton and Palisades fires, survivors looked to their insurers to help rebuild. We’d paid premiums for decades exactly for this moment. Yet we’ve been met with obstruction, delay and bureaucracy. 
Navigating this quagmire multiplies the trauma of those grieving the loss of their homes, belongings and community.
The California Unfair Insurance Practices Act was created in 1959 to protect consumers from such tactics. Unfortunately, every fire survivor has a story about their insurer violating it — rotating adjusters, ignoring emails and disregarding legally mandated deadlines. 
Yet, to date, there has not been a single public enforcement action related to these fires. California’s laws are a regulatory mirage: they offer the illusion of protection but vanish the moment a homeowner tries to invoke them.
The most insidious insurer violation is “toxic gaslighting.” Thousands of residents downwind of the fires are battling to abate smoke and soot damage, yet insurers frequently deny those claims, arguing that smoke doesn’t constitute fire damage. 
The soot that blanketed our communities contains carcinogens, including lead, asbestos and heavy metals. Yet insurers rarely pay for the industrial hygienist testing required to confirm the presence of such substances. Instead, insurers pressure homeowners to believe a simple vacuum and wipe-down will suffice. That leaves behind toxic particulates, putting residents at risk. Some victims have paid thousands out-of-pocket for their own testing, only to have their results ignored.
Under the current status quo, the Department of Insurance complaint process is a black hole. There is a near-zero response rate to homeowners who submit complaints. 
Only if the department receives an overwhelming number of complaints about a single insurer will it consider an investigation. Then, like with a class-action lawsuit, the state’s “market conduct examination” is a lengthy process that concludes well after a rebuild has finished, failing to offer timely recourse to the individual homeowner. 
For a survivor, time is a weapon. Most policies include “additional living expense” coverage that would pay for rent while a home is repaired, but in a post-disaster market where rents have skyrocketed, this fund is quickly consumed. 
We are not seeing the full consequences yet, but the outcome already is clear: families will soon face the choice of homelessness or accepting an unsafe settlement. 
Every ignored phone call helps drain the additional living expense funds. As the money runs out, people’s resolve weakens and unfair settlements become increasingly attractive. Delay has become a profitable business strategy.
And asking individual homeowners to face down the Goliath of insurance corporations while the state regulator idly collects statistics is untenable. 
Back in 1988, a California Supreme Court ruling stripped away consumers’ right to sue for violations of California’s unfair insurance practices law. By decreeing that only the Insurance Commissioner, not the victim, has the power to punish these violations, the court effectively removed any immediate consequence for insurer malfeasance.
Now California needs a radical shift to change this economic equation. We must restore the accountability lost in 1988 by creating a streamlined, administrative path for justice. 
We should allow the insurance department to validate complaints and pass them to administrative law judges, who can adjudicate individual violations in real-time. The judges would have the authority to decide a fair claim amount and levy a significant fine — paid directly to the insured, not the state.
This creates an immediate financial consequence for non-compliance and ensures that insurers’ bad-faith practices are no longer profitable.
Furthermore, any company-caused delay should trigger a “delay tax,” in the form of additional living expense payments, over and above the policy limit. If the insurer drags its feet, it — not the survivor — must foot the bill for people’s extended displacement. 
The insurance department’s complaint system also must be rebuilt, so it can provide real-time feedback and receive surge funding during disasters. To prevent insurers from hiding behind a lack of evidence, the Insurance Commissioner should establish an “ash zone” perimeter within which smoke damage is presumed and testing is mandatory. 
Finally, the state should launch a “Know Your Rights” campaign after every disaster, so insurers can’t exploit a survivor’s ignorance of the law.
Insurance companies are entitled to due process, but fire survivors are entitled to the good faith they earned by paying decades of premiums. Until the cost of non-compliance outweighs insurers’ savings from malfeasance and delay, California’s homeowners will continue to be victimized twice — once by a disaster and then by insurers.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010825_Eaton-Fire_TS_CM_04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-12 08:57:32.811558

Steven Bradford
Steven Bradford, a former state legislator from Gardena, is running for Insurance Commissioner


With the first anniversary of the devastating Southern California wildfires approaching, CalMatters asked candidates for the 2026 state Insurance Commissioner race to share thoughts on what the state can do to help victims and stabilize insurers. This is the fourth response. Read the other candidate responses here, here and here.
Growing up in Gardena, we would sit around the dinner table and my father would share stories about  the importance of life insurance. You see, my father, Booker, sold life insurance. I understood from an early age, watching and listening to him, the value of insurance for life, household and automobile. 
I can remember Sundays after church being with my father and watching him help folks understand the importance of purchasing appropriate insurance and of not missing a premium payment to keep the policy in force. 
It is this consumer-based background that I’ll bring to the office of the Insurance Commissioner — a lifelong appreciation of the importance of insurance.
How can California keep home insurers and coverage in the state?
I am reminded of Al Gore’s book, “An Inconvenient Truth.” He emphasized that while we have policies that can address climate change, the political will to change lags. Gore also was correct when he described the science as an “inconvenient truth.”  We cannot have it both ways — either climate change is real and we must deal with it responsibly, or not. 
I am not going to sugarcoat this — insurance rates are an issue in play because reality is in play. I promise that any rate impacts will be based on science, reality and the long-term best interests of Californians.  California can incentivize home insurers to increase market capacity by continuing to implement a sustainable insurance strategy. 
We can be faster and more efficient when reviewing rate filings by increasing the rate review team, eliminating non-productive administrative hurdles not mandated by Proposition 103 and concentrating on eliminating the uncertainty and friction inherent in the current regulation-based rate and form application process.
We must create a fast path, or a flex band, for rate increases or decreases below a certain  threshold (for example, 5%).  And it is only common sense that we deregulate commercial rates because commercial policyholders are sophisticated purchasers with sophisticated brokers and risk managers and other tools at their disposal. 
How can California prevent insurers from price gouging?
To create the best options for consumers, we must have a vibrant insurance market with competition.  As Commissioner, I will ensure that consumers have options – this means a competitive market with multiple insurers competing for business. 
As Insurance Commissioner I will ensure that insurers are not taking advantage of consumers but receive the rate review process necessary to keep their capital in California. I will modernize and adequately staff the department’s rate regulation bureau to examine insurers that attempt to charge excessive rates.
I plan to enhance consumer education. 
Despite all the disruptions in recent years, prices in California are about even with the national average and much lower than in East Coast natural disaster zones. When considering the high cost of homes and rebuilding, one can plausibly argue that California property insurance rates are currently appropriate compared to other disaster-risk places in our country.
How should California stabilize the FAIR Plan? 
The current over-reliance on the FAIR Plan is not sustainable. We must begin a process to  depopulate the number of policies in the FAIR Plan. I believe this will best be done by a fully  functional, competitive insurance market. 
I support the implementation of Assembly Bill 226, which will allow for the issuance of bonds to finance the costs of claims, to increase the liquidity and claims-paying capacity of the FAIR Plan, to refund bonds previously issued for that purpose and reduce the reliance on expensive reinsurance.
We did this 25 years ago when faced with a workers’ compensation meltdown. Assemblymember Lisa Calderon’s bill can do it again with respect to the property insurance crisis we now face. 
I want to evaluate including the FAIR Plan in the California Insurance Guarantee Association, as a means to more efficiently spread risk among all of the parties that are benefitted by — and burdened by — the realities of the California market. 
In summary, reinvigorating our insurance market will not occur overnight, because the problems and issues did not materialize overnight. It will take time and the will power to make difficult decisions. I have that ability and am willing to make those difficult choices. 
But let’s keep in mind, California insurance consumers still pay less than East Coastal hurricane  zone rate payers. The California insurance market has not collapsed the way it has in Florida, where  major insurers — not just the low-market-share companies — have abandoned the state. 
All we have to do is look at the Florida insurance market to learn what not to do. 
We have an opportunity to fix our market here. We just must be honest, smart and  reasonable.

A symbolic rite of passage to honor humanity’s transition to a sustainable and harmonious technological future. 
Below the text, a QR code is etched into the stainless steel. When scanned with a smart phone, the code navigates to an error page. 
Beyond this relatively small arch, in a high desert valley rapidly filling with massive data centers, lies the northern terminus of the Greenlink West transmission line at Comstock Meadows Substation. 
When the Berkshire Hathaway Energy subsidiary NV Energy officially announced the 525 kV transmission line project known as Greenlink, it explicitly described the project as vital and necessary to fulfill the State of Nevada’s mandate to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels. In its July 2021 Plan of Development, NV Energy stated: 
“Development of the Greenlink West Transmission Project facilitates access to renewable energy zones and is necessary to accommodate decommissioning of conventional fossil fuel generation resources.” 
In 2021, NV Energy estimated the combined cost for construction of the Greenlink North and Greenlink West transmission projects would be $2.5 billion. By the time the project was granted federal approval in September 2024, that number had ballooned to $4.2 billion, and the company was already appealing to the state’s Public Utilities Commission to approve increases in the base rate for electricity. Nevada’s monopoly electric utility company sought to pass a portion of the cost of construction on to its customers, and in return, Nevadans were promised a secure, redundant, reliable, and lower carbon-footprint electric grid. 
In September 2025, the PUC approved a rate hike of $4 per month in Southern Nevada specifically to recoup Greenlink West construction costs, in addition to a state-wide peak usage rate that will increase electricity bills by over $25 for most customers. This rate hike fits into a broader trend of increasing economic stress on a growing proportion of Americans, with difficulty affording electric bills reported as particularly acute. 
In spite of its optimistic name, the Greenlink transmission project has been criticized by environmental groups, who argue that in addition to damage to Nevada wild lands from construction of the transmission line itself, this infrastructure will accelerate rapid development of industrial solar installations on wild public lands adjacent to the line. 
In May 2025, Friends of Nevada Wilderness and Basin and Range Watch jointly filed a lawsuit against the Bureau of Land Management and other federal agencies to halt the construction of Greenlink West on the grounds that they violated federal environmental law during the review process. These watchdog organizations see Greenlink West as the initial hairline fracture running through some of the last remaining unbroken wild land in the lower 48 states, opening up the Nevada outback as a sacrifice zone in the name of decarbonization. 
This intention is explicit: NV Energy has pitched the project from the start as a conduit for bringing electricity generated from massive new solar fields in remote areas of the desert to the centers of demand around Reno and Las Vegas. 
But where and to whom will this brave new voltage actually flow? 
The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported in September 2025 that NV Energy acknowledged a suite of tech companies will be allowed to access electricity transmitted via Greenlink lines. The combined Greenlink North and West will be able to transmit up to 5,000 MW. NV Energy has promised Switch, Novva, and others up to 4,000 MW for a complex of massive AI data centers in the greater Reno area. 
This recent wave of high-tech development in northern Nevada is concentrated at the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, along the Truckee River between Sparks and Fernley, where Switch opened a 130 MW data center next door to the Tesla Gigafactory in 2017. Since then, Google, Tract, EdgeCore, Novva, Vantage, PowerHouse, Apple, Blockchains, and Microsoft also acquired land in the area and began building data centers. Tucked in behind Google’s data center complex at the south end of Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center is NV Energy’s Comstock Meadows Substation, currently undergoing an expansion to become the northernmost node of Greenlink. 
In order to keep up with the spike in electricity demand caused by these new data centers, Mark IV Capital has announced plans to construct a 1,800 MW natural gas generating station in nearby Fernley, with intent to transfer the plant to NV Energy. This, too, fits a broader trend of big tech rushing to build fossil fuel-powered generating stations to power data centers.
Incidentally, the southern terminus of the Greenlink West transmission line is at the Apex Generating Station northeast of Las Vegas, which will enable NV Energy to bring power produced there from natural gas all the way to northern Nevada. 
Contrary to the purpose stated in NV Energy’s Plan of Development, Greenlink will not result in decommissioning of fossil fuel power generation. Instead, Nevada can expect an increase in power generated from fossil fuels due to the sharp spike in demand caused by these data centers, in spite of a concurrent increase in renewable energy. 
Communities across the Southwest have started to take stock of the effects of the current boom in artificial intelligence, especially the tremendous amounts of electricity and water consumed by data centers. In Arizona, Tucson’s city council unanimously rejected a proposed Amazon Web Services data center in August 2025, and Page residents filed a referendum to stop a data center on the banks of the Colorado River in December. 
As it becomes apparent that the electricity demand of new data centers in northern Nevada will eclipse the transmission capacity of the new Greenlink lines before the project is completed, Nevadans have now joined the ranks of ordinary working people across the country subsidizing Big Tech’s AI infrastructure buildout through their local electric utility. Will Greenlink ever fulfill its promise to bring clean energy to Nevada homes and businesses? Is the state any closer to its decarbonization goals?",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Comstock-Overview-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-12 08:12:08.857031

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utahns may soon no longer be able to sue third parties for being responsible for damaging their marriages. That’s if the state Legislature votes to abolish the right to file civil claims for what courts define as “alienation of affection.”  
Woods Cross Republican Sen. Todd Weiler is sponsoring a bill this year that, if passed, would specify in the state code that come May 6, “there is no right of action for alienation of affections.” 
Turning the bill into law would place Utah in line with the majority of states that have prohibited it as a cause of action for lawsuits, Weiler said. It would also do away with a “patently offensive concept.” 
“This legal claim stems from this medieval concept that a wife is the chattel of her husband, and if somebody else is getting favors or taking advantage, that they owe some type of money to the husband because they’ve used his property,” Weiler said in an interview Friday. 
Utah radio personalities and even the Utah Division of Wildlife have been part of these types of lawsuits, according to a 2004 report from the Deseret News. A former member of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, for example, sued church leaders for $10 million arguing they influenced his divorce after convincing his ex-wife she couldn’t achieve salvation if she remained married to him. That lawsuit was dismissed.

Last year a North Carolina case made national headlines when a TikTok influencer was ordered to pay $1.75 million after a jury found her liable for having an affair with her manager, according to CNN.
Weiler said that case didn’t influence his decision to run the bill. But, other cases of “vengeful” litigation and threats have, especially since the cause of action has been used to up the ante and make divorce settlements harder, he said.
“It also, I think, disrespects the free will of parties who have decided to move on to a different relationship,” Weiler said. “And so, because it’s mostly just weaponized these days, and that’s why it’s been, I think, banned in other states, we’re just just taking that off the table.”
Weiler is also sponsoring a bill that would strike Utah from the short list of states that allow common-law marriages, or marriages that are legally recognized between two people without a marriage license or a solemnized wedding.
If the Legislature votes to approve his proposal, “a marriage that is not properly solemnized (will become) invalid unless a court or administrative order legally recognized the marriage before May 6, 2026.”
This is more of a cleanup bill, Weiler said, and wouldn’t have an impact on how couples choose to have their wedding officiated.
Utah has been moving away from common-law marriage for a while, Weiler said. The state currently allows the “recognition of an unsolemnized marriage.” So, couples who have lived together longer than they have been married can sometimes claim the marriage started with their cohabitation.
“It just complicates, and I think, bogs down litigation. And the uncertainty of it all makes it harder to settle a case,” Weiler said. “And we don’t want to make cases hard to settle, because then, if every case goes to trial, then we have more backlog, and we have to build more courthouses and hire more judges.”

The Alabama Legislature begins its 2026 legislative session on Tuesday, with many lawmakers expecting to focus on the budgets and eschew larger issues. (Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)If legislators’ main goal for the 2026 Alabama legislative session could be summarized in five words, they would be “let’s get this over with.”
With elections looming — and lawmakers forbidden from fundraising while the Legislature is in session — Senate Pro Tempore Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, said in an interview Wednesday that his priority for the session, beginning on Tuesday, is to pass the state’s budgets, the legislature’s only constitutional obligation, and get back to the districts to campaign.
“I think people are gravitating towards willing to go back home and get ready to start politicking back in our district. If we’re able to get in and get out, I think that’s a positive for all of our members in both houses of the Legislature,” Gudger said.

It’s a traditional approach to election year sessions, and most lawmakers are expecting not to address large issues lacking immediate urgency.
“I am not sure we are going to have a big push on much of anything this year,” said Senate Finance and Taxation General Fund Chair Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, in an interview on Monday. “As far as criminal justice is concerned, I have not heard anything of significance coming that way.”
But that doesn’t mean there will be no major issues awaiting lawmakers. Legislators will have to address requested increases in the state’s two public employee health insurance programs.
That could affect two other education programs. Legislators will be tempted to extend pay raises to teachers this year, but whether the money will be there is uncertain.
There will likely be a push to expand the CHOOSE Act, a voucher-like program that gives $7,000 to students for non-public education expenses, including private school tuition. But there may also be some balking at the price tag.
Legislators will also consider proposals to expand capital punishment in the state, one of which may be at odds with a U.S. Supreme Court case.




A fast session start

When the Legislature is in session, lawmakers typically hold legislative sessions on Tuesdays and Thursdays, with Wednesdays serving as committee days. Senate President Pro Tem Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, said he expects each chamber to be in session Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday for the first two weeks, possibly the third. Attempts to reach House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, were not successful before publication.
Under the Constitution, the Legislature’s regular session can last for up to 30 days of a 105-day calendar period.
“We want to make sure that we do it correctly the first time, instead of being in such a rush that we were trying to go through the 30 days,” Gudger said.


Lawmakers have their own individuals concerns and priorities, above all passing local bills for their particular districts. Sen. Tim Melson, R-Florence, the chair of the Senate Health Committee, wants to see some local economic development bills pass.
Melson also said that he wants the Legislature to focus on “tackling tough issues,” not high school sports, referencing ongoing litigation between the Legislature and the Alabama High School Athletic Association due to eligibility issues caused by the CHOOSE Act.
“There’s a lot of things that we need to get done and get out,” he said. “I know that the high school athletic association’s made a lot of news right now, and we’re getting down to where we legislate high school sports. We’re looking for something to attack. We need to go ahead and attack rural health care and things like that.”
Gudger also said he wanted to get local bills passed, especially those that did not pass in 2025 due to miscommunication between the chambers.
“Any local bills and any bills that affect campaigns coming up that affect their own district, we want to make sure we prioritize those this year, to make sure that we get those guys the help that they need back home,” Gudger said.
House Minority Leader Anthony Daniels, D-Huntsville, said in a recent interview that affordable healthcare is at the top of his list.
“In light of a lot of the conversations at the federal level, affordability will be among the top priorities as a result of the cuts that we’ve experienced at the federal level,” he said.
But few people are expecting large issues to dominate. Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, the chair of the House Ways and Means Education Committee, believes this year’s session will move quickly so legislators can begin campaigning.
“A lot of these legislators certainly want to be out in their districts. Of the ones who are running for re-election will be out in their districts. And so there’ll be an effort to be as efficient as possible,” he said.
Education

Several education issues will be waiting for lawmakers.
Pay raises: Teacher pay raises have been a topic of discussion for members of the Ways and Means Education Committee. Education employees did not get pay raises last year. The Legislature instead opted to increase funding for health insurance to prevent increased costs for those working in public education.
“I think that there is a possibility that we’ll have a teacher pay raise. I think I’ve been hearing about that from some of the budget chairman and so that’s encouraging,” said Rep. Terri Collins, R-Decatur, the chair of the House Education Policy Committee.
CHOOSE Act: The CHOOSE Act will be a point of discussion, and not just over funding.  The athletic eligibility of CHOOSE Act recipients, the focal point of the lawsuit brought by Gov. Kay Ivey and House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, against the AHSAA, could also emerge.
Albritton said legislators have discussed expanding funding for the program.
“We have discussed that, because it seems to be very popular, but the conditions come in: what can we afford, and what benefit does it do, and what harm does it do? We don’t know those yet,” Albritton said in a recent interview.
But other legislators have concerns with expanding CHOOSE Act funding. The program currently caps eligibility for the program at 300% of the federal poverty level, but those limits will come off on Jan. 1, 2027, potentially leading to a massive increase in the cost of the program.
“My concern is the thought of, after two years, being a universal school choice, I think we have to keep a cap on it, because you look at other states that don’t have a cap, and some of the situations they find themselves in right now where they can’t afford to fund it. So I just think that we need to be very careful going forward,” said Sen. Donnie Chesteen, R-Geneva, the chair of the Senate Education Policy Committee.
Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, the chair of the Senate Finance and Taxation Education Committee, said CHOOSE Act funds should be reserved for families whose household income is 300% below the federal poverty level before eligibility is expanded regardless of income.
“The primary commitment is to focus on those at that household income level, to make sure that we’re able to fulfill the demand that might be coming from that group of people. And then, of course, we had special ed, military carve out,” Orr said. “Then the people that are prioritized after that, we just have to see.”
AHSAA: Last year, Ivey and Ledbetter sued the AHSAA over treating CHOOSE Act recipients as transfers who had to sit one year out. A judge presiding over the case has ordered mediations for the parties in November.
Chesteen, a former high school football coach, suggested splitting the two schooling types into two different leagues for sports as well.
“I think that that would help in what a lot of public school coaches feel is the competitive imbalance right now between the private schools and public schools. And I think that if you look at the championships, especially your lower classification, that would validate that point,” Chesteen said.
According to the Montgomery Advertiser, the AHSAA is considering a postseason change like Chesteen’s proposal.
Law enforcement scholarships: One bill that Collins wants to see pass this year is HB 98 sponsored by Rep. Allen Treadaway, R-Morris. The bill would allow the spouse or child of a law enforcement officer who is killed or left disabled while on duty to receive financial assistance to pay for college tuition. Money for the bill would be budgeted through the Education Trust Fund.
The bill unanimously passed in the House during the 2025 session and got approval from the Senate Judiciary Committee, but failed to get a full vote from the Senate.
Rep. Rex Reynolds, R-Huntsville, said in a recent interview he also wants to see the bill pass.
“It just didn’t come on the calendar in the Senate, and I think that that’s an important bill for retention of our police officers in Alabama,” he said.

Other: Rep. Terri Collins, R-Decatur, the chair of the House Education Policy Committee also wants to change the school grading system this year.
“I’m looking at modifying that so it’s a better means of accountability, and it actually incentivizes us to improve even greater than we have been,”
This year, Daniels said he wants to focus on increasing science scores for fourth grade students.
“Where I live, we’re focused on science,” Daniels said. “I think that we must not take our eyes off of the K through career, and not excluding, but including higher education, so that we’re preparing a pipeline for high paying jobs in other fields. But science is an incredible part of that infrastructure,” he said.
Orr’s top priority after the budgets is passing an outcomes-based funding model for higher education, similar to the RAISE Act for K-12 schools.
“Junior colleges are already doing this, but this will be a slight tweak to what they’re doing, but with our 14 institutions plus Tuskegee to work with them to improve our outputs,” Orr said.

Health care

Lawmakers will have few decisions to make on health care policy, but lots on health care coverage. Recent federal policy changes have added pressure to the state’s budgets. Both state health insurance plans, the Public Educator Employee’s Health Insurance Plan (PEEHIP) and the State Employee Insurance Board (SEIB), plan to request more money from the state to alleviate rising health costs. 
PEEHIP’s request will impact the ETF, while SEIB’s request will impact the General Fund budget. PEEHIP plans to request a $380 million increase for fiscal year 2027. Orr said in an interview Wednesday that he hopes the PEEHIP board will meet the Legislature halfway to meet the funding need.
“That’s going to be a challenge. Now if the PEEHIP board will meet us halfway on that increase, and they take half of the $380 (million) and we take half, I think we can have a decent budget year,” Orr said.
Garrett, chair of the House Ways and Means Education Committee, said in an interview that the PEEHIP request “is pretty large.”
“We’re going to be having to consider that,” he said. “So we’re eager to see what the governor puts in her budget,” Garrett said.
Reynolds said one of his priorities this year is to ensure a “conservative general fund budget” that includes funding for what he calls “critical” services in the state such as mental health, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency and the Bureau of Pardons and Paroles.
He also wants to add an Opioid Supplemental Appropriation into the general fund budget.
“I’m working with the commission and the off time to come up with the recommended appropriation and we do that with the opioid settlement dollars that continue to come into Alabama,” he said.
Hospitals and rural health: Although some federal policy changes have created some tension for the state’s budgets, one program could help the state’s rural hospitals. Alabama was awarded $203.4 million by the Centers of Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) through the Rural Health Transformation Program, part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) passed in July.
The five-year $50 billion grant program aims to soften the impacts of upcoming Medicaid budget cuts if used strategically, but could partially offset just over a third (37%) of the estimated federal Medicaid spending cuts in rural areas, which are projected to be $137 billion over ten years. The program is administered by the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs (ADECA).

Reynolds, chair of the House General Fund Way and Means Committee, said he is focused on the outcomes of the program. He is also on the state’s advisory board for the program.
“We will appropriate the money, the first $100 million, to ADECA once that application process is approved, and then the second 100 million per year has some strings tied to it, and we’ll work through those to see what percentage of that money will also be available for Alabama,” Reynolds said in an interview before Alabama was awarded $203.4 million.
According to the University of North Carolina’s Sheps Center, nine rural hospitals have closed in Alabama since 2009. Only 30% of the state’s rural hospitals have labor and delivery units, leaving many expectant parents to drive long distances for care.

Many of Alabama’s existing hospitals are struggling. The state’s hospitals have long pushed for Medicaid expansion, saying it would provide needed funding to keep doors open.
While Alabama Republican House leaders have signaled openness to a public-private hybrid approach to expansion, the Senate has been hostile, and removed a provision from a 2024 gambling bill that could have provided money for the program.
House and Senate Republicans said in interviews that Medicaid expansion is off the table for 2026.
“I think expansion is kind of off the table completely. We’re just trying to make ends meet,” Allbritton said.
Daniels said although he believes there are Republican legislators who support Medicaid expansion, he doesn’t think it will happen this year.
“Do I feel that there are a lot of folks that are in support of expansion on the other side? I do, but I don’t think that they would see that as an issue that they were willing to down the sword for in this election,” Daniels said.
Criminal justice
The state has its share of criminal justice issues. Alabama’s prison crisis continues to rage. And while most cities in the state saw declines in homicides last year, Alabama continues to have some of the highest rates of death from firearms in the nation.
Some lawmakers interviewed said they were waiting to gauge the impact of federal legislation, such as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBA), which allocated about $170 billion for the decade for immigration and border enforcement. The legislation also provides grants to state and local law enforcement.
But others, as they have for years, said they will wait to see how the $1.3 billion Gov. Kay Ivey Correctional Complex, a 4,000-bed men’s prison in Elmore County expected to open later this year, will affect the prisons. Lawmakers may also move to start work on a second men’s prison in Escambia County.
The Legislature in 2021 approved a $1.3 billion package intended to cover the cost of both facilities, but the price tag on the Elmore facility soared and took up most of the funding.
Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, walks across the floor of the Alabama Senate on April 10, 2025 at the Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery, Alabama. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)
“The state has issued a request for qualification for the general manager who will have oversight,” Albritton said regarding the construction project for the Escambia facility. “That is going to change from the one from Elmore, we are going to get a new one for Escambia.”
Albritton said that request was issued in November and the contract is set to be awarded soon. The appointment of the manager then sets the stage for the requests for proposals for other parts of the construction project, which Albritton expects to break ground in the spring.
In February, the Legislature approved a bill that allows the state to borrow an additional $500 million for the site in Escambia. In an interview that same month, Albritton told members of the media that about 60% of the cost of building the Escambia facility has been secured.
Albritton does not expect any additional legislation that deals with prison construction, as most of the policies and financing were finalized with legislation that was approved in prior years.
“Other than that, we are in pretty good shape,” Albritton said on Tuesday. “We had excess funds that had not been earlier appropriated through the years that we have taken and pushed into that fund. It is taking other available monies.”
Despite the prison crisis, lawmakers have also prefiled bills that would impose stiffer penalties or expand the use of the death penalty. HB 41, sponsored by Rep. Matt Simpson, R-Daphne, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, would extend capital punishment to those convicted of sexually assaulting children. The U.S. Supreme Court declared a similar Louisiana law unconstitutional in 2008, citing in part the trauma that prosecuting death penalty cases can impose on children.
Simpson filed a similar bill during the 2025 session, saying that people who commit such crimes are “the worst of the worst.”
Rep. Matt Simpson, R-Daphne, goes to his desk in the Alabama House of Representatives on April 29, 2025 at the Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery, Alabama. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)
Simpson has filed another bill, HB 20,  to allow prosecutors to pursue the death penalty for endangering the public while someone is committing murder.
HB 11, sponsored by Rep. Phillip Pettus, R-Killeen, would lower the maximum age for youthful offender status for those charged with murder or capital murder from 19 to 16. He filed nearly identical legislation in 2025 but failed to get the measure approved before the session ended.
Another bill, SB 31, sponsored by Sen. Matt Woods, R-Jasper, increases the penalty for making a terrorist threat in the first degree from a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $6,000 fine, to a Class B felony, punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a $30,000 fine.
HB 7 also enhances the penalty for making a terrorist threat in the second degree, going from a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail and a $6,000 fine, to a Class D felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine of $7,500.
Another group of lawmakers introduced bills to implement reforms to the criminal legal system.
Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, has filed legislation to try and limit capital punishment. HB 76 attempts to amend the constitution to prohibit the death penalty entirely, while HB 70 expands the prohibition for judicial overrides for the death penalty by making it retroactive from 2017 when the Legislature banned the practice.
England said he believed there would be discussion about oversight over the Alabama Department of Corrections, citing ‘The Alabama Solution,’ an HBO documentary that used video taken by inmates to show violence and decrepit conditions in the state’s correctional facilities. “I think there will be some discussion about increasing transparency and accountability within the Alabama Department of Corrections,” England said in an interview on Monday.

England also filed HB 71, which would prohibit medical examiners from harvesting the organs of the deceased without  permission from family members. He filed a similar bill during the 2025 session but failed to get it enacted by the Legislature.
Lawsuits are currently working their way through the state court system pertaining to that issue.

ATTOM, a real estate data analyst, found the median price of single-family homes and condos was less affordable in 586 of 594 counties with enough data to be included in the analysis. 
In Clark County, where the annual typical wage was $66,105, a buyer in the last quarter of 2025 would have had to spend 42% of their pay on home expenses, compared with a historical average of 31.7%. 
Clark County was the 223rd most affordable county of the 594 analyzed in the report, while Washoe County was 220th. 
A homebuyer in Washoe County, which had an annual average wage of $70,954, would have had to spend 48.4% of that on home expenses in the last quarter, compared with a historical average of 38.9%. 
ATTOM determined affordability by measuring annualized weekly wage data against the income needed to pay expenses for a median-priced home, (including mortgage, taxes, insurance, and association dues) assuming a 20% down payment and 28% debt-to-income ratio. 
 
﻿
 
In 43% of the counties analyzed in the report, median home prices grew at a greater rate than wages. In Nevada, however, wages grew faster than home prices. In the last quarter of the year annualized wages grew by 4.4%, while home prices increased by .7%. 
Purchasing a home last year was least affordable in Kings County, NY, where a buyer would have to spend 103.1% of wages on housing expenses, followed by Marin County, CA (97.3%); Santa Cruz County, CA (94.4%); Orange County, CA (90.3%); and Monterey County, CA (90.3%).
The national median price of a home in the second and third quarter was a record high $365,000. A buyer would have had to earn $86,374 to purchase a median-priced home and keep expenses below the standard recommended threshold of 28% of annual income, the report says. 
“Over the past five years, home price growth has nearly doubled wage growth, meaning home buying power in 2026 will depend not only on whether prices level off or decline, but also on mortgage rates and broader economic conditions,” Rob Barber, CEO of ATTOM, said in a news release. 
In the last five years, the median sales price of a home has increased by 54%, while wages are up 29%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, through the second quarter of last year. 
In 74% of the counties analyzed, home expenses exceeded the standard threshold of no more than 28% of the average resident’s pay, making homeownership unaffordable. Those counties include large metropolitan areas such as Los Angeles, where home ownership eats up 67.5% of typical wages; Maricopa County, AZ (38.1%); San Diego (67.4%); Orange County (90.3%); and Miami-Dade County, FL (43.6% of wages).
In about 30% of the 594 counties analyzed, home purchase expenses in the fourth quarter exceeded 43% of the typical resident’s wages, which is considered seriously unaffordable.
The report assigns an affordability scale to each county. Those with scores under 100 are less affordable than historic averages. 
That landed Clark County a 75 on the affordability scale for the quarter and an even more unaffordable 60 for the entire year. 
Last year, the median price of homes in Clark County, according to the report, was $437,500 in the first quarter, topped out at $449,900 in the second quarter of 2025, and fell to $443,500 in the fourth quarter, ending the year up 1% from the last.  
Washoe scored 80 on the affordability scale for the last quarter and 63 for the year.  
In Washoe County, the median price was $539,000 in the first quarter, jumped to $555,000 in the second quarter, and ended the year at $553,209 – down 2% from 2024.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/housing-vista-ronda-aerial-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-12 08:12:08.857031

Both have set records in their pursuit of public financing under the revised Citizens’ Election Program, which will provide qualifying major party candidates about $3.2 million for a primary and $15.4 million to the eventual nominee.
Stewart, whose application was approved last week after about 11 months of fundraising, qualified earlier than other participants in the history of the voluntary program; Fazio was the quickest to reach the threshold, raising $272,069 in less than five months.
“The continued record-breaking momentum behind our campaign is deeply gratifying and energizing,” Fazio said in a statement.
Stewart, 38, the former mayor of New Britain, and Fazio, 35, a state senator from Greenwich, are vying to become the youngest nominee for governor since John G. Rowland won the GOP nomination at age 33 in 1990.
Gov. Ned Lamont, 71, a Democrat seeking a third term, is self-funding his campaign, as he did in 2018 and 2022. Each time, his Republican opponent was Bob Stefanowski, also a self-funder.
Lamont spent $25.7 million on the 2022 race; Stefanowski spent $14.5 million. The public financing grants that year were $1.6 million for a primary and $7.7 million for the general election.
Revisions made after the 2022 election gave Stewart and Fazio a strong incentive to qualify in the first month of the election year: For the first time, a qualifying major-party candidate can get an early convention grant, essentially a partial advance from the $3.2 million primary award.
After a review of Stewart’s qualifying contributions, the State Elections Enforcement Commission voted unanimously last week to award her an $806,875 convention grant.
In previous cycles, no grant was available until a candidate had qualified for a primary, which cannot occur prior to the parties’ nominating conventions in May.
Reaching the $250,000 threshold will not result in Fazio immediately getting his convention grant. His finances will be reviewed for compliance with the rules.
Each qualifying contribution for a gubernatorial campaign must be at least $5 and no more than $250. Ninety percent of the contributions must come from in-state donors, and none can come from state contractors. The commission checks to ensure there is an individual donor for each contribution.
Campaign finance reports for the quarter ending Dec. 31 are due Monday. State Rep. Josh Elliott, D-Hamden, who is making a long-shot run opposing Lamont for the nomination, has struggled in his fundraising.
Betsy McCaughey, a Newsmax host and former lieutenant governor of New York, has told Republicans she is likely to run for the GOP nomination.
Entering the race with 49 days left in the previous quarter, Fazio raised $157,233 by Sept. 30. He reported raising another $114,300 in the final reporting period of the year.
Fazio said the fast fundraising was a measure of support.
“Connecticut voters are ready for positive change,” he said. “They are ready for leadership that will finally cut our sky-high electric rates and taxes, support our law enforcement, defend local control, and create opportunity for every family. Our campaign is based on that substantive change, and that’s exactly the reason for our momentum.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ryan-Fazio-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-12 08:12:08.857031

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Tuesday will bring a new session of the Alabama Legislature. But an old question nags at me.
How do we get lawmakers who don’t harm us?
Look at what this Legislature has done since the 2022 elections.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
It approved a law criminalizing some forms of ballot assistance. The justifications were the same debunked nonsense about election security and fraud spewing all over the country. (Don’t even ask about the fate of bills to make voting easier.)
Lawmakers told Black Alabamians that their long history — full of struggle, pain and accomplishment — was a “divisive concept.” They didn’t say that outright, of course. They just passed a vaguely worded law warning teachers not to “compel” students to “adhere” to a concept that might lead them to accept guilt for something their ancestors had done.
Thus allowing the most brittle white Alabamians to put educators’ jobs in jeopardy. For the high crime of teaching accurate history.
Another effect of that law: Our major universities now silence the voices of nonwhite, nonheterosexual people and try to push them out of public life. Because the Legislature has made it clear that the rights of free speech and assembly only apply to whites, and only conditionally to white women.
Lawmakers steered $180 million of our taxes to the poor suffering families with children enrolled expensive private academies. Alabama public schools, already starved for revenue, can’t afford to lose that. None of us can afford what could be a budget-busting program in the coming years, if lawmakers allow it to run without income restraints.
And there’s everything legislators haven’t done.
The closest lawmakers came to addressing our ongoing rural health crisis was vague Medicaid expansion language in a 2024 House gambling bill. That got erased by the Senate before the whole package collapsed. Now they’re trying voluntary donations to rural hospitals, a policy that is not serious and will not be effective.
We have so many firearm deaths that we exceed New York State, a place with four times our population. Legislators did pass a state ban on Glock switches last year, but as long as they keep treating deadly weapons as sacred objects, all of us will remain in peril.
Republican lawmakers shrugged at the soaring costs of a $1 billion+ correctional facility in Elmore County. Their indifference extends to the prospect of borrowing hundreds of millions of dollars more for a facility in Escambia.
Don’t expect the arc of the Legislature to bend in 2026. As is usually the case in an election year, lawmakers want to finish as quickly as possible and get on with campaigning and fundraising.
And yet over the last four years, we got glimpses of a different Legislature.
The Education Trust Fund budget, about $8.2 billion in fiscal year 2023, is $9.9 billion today. The General Fund, which pays for most non-education programs in the state, grew from $2.7 billion three years ago to $3.7 billion today.
Caveats apply, particularly for the General Fund, where most of that increase reflects rising costs in Medicaid and Corrections. But bold as it seems, I’m going to say paying for public services is a good thing.
Legislators also ameliorated some parts of Alabama’s egregiously unfair, won’t-someone-spare-the-wealthy tax system. They cut the onerous state grocery levy from 4% to 2%. Local grocery taxes remain. So does the pathetic fact that the state taxes food while letting timber barons pay pittances in property tax. But reducing the burden is better than nothing.
The Legislature also took some tentative moves to address the fruits of that unfair tax system by allocating some public school money based on need, a necessary help for poor and rural students, among others.
Positive steps.
But we don’t elect positive people to the Legislature. We elect men and women who project anger and promise revenge on some group that never wronged us in the first place.
There is no idealism in Alabama politics. State politicians care about power and holding it. They keep lashing out at minorities and spending taxpayer dollars on wealthy children. And voters, to this point, have not punished them for it.
So Alabama lawmakers prioritize cruelty, division and running a government that works against most people who live here.
Is there any hope for change? Maybe if voters have more choices in November. We’ll know exactly how many in a few weeks, when candidate qualifying ends in the 140 legislative races on the ballot this year.
2026 could just end up as another leg of the endless race for the angriest member of the Republican base. But if we get options, voters should ask two questions about their candidates.
Are they running to solve problems? Or to give us targets?
More simply: Do they want to do something for us? Or to us?
If the latter, we’ll get another four years of Montgomery treating us like children. As helpless beings who need to be disciplined, punished and excluded from their own governance.
If the former, you might get that rarest of all things in state politics: An Alabama Legislature that works for Alabamians.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Mark-Gridley-Tracey-Estes-Feb-4-2025-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-12 08:12:08.857031
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-12 12:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Metro-North ticket changes: What CT residents should know,Gabby DeBenedictis,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/12/ct-metro-north-january-ticket-changes/,Travelers on Metro-North's New Haven Line are adjusting to changes in buying and using train tickets. Here's what to know.,"Connecticut commuters and visitors to New York City on Metro-North’s New Haven Line are getting accustomed to changes in buying and using train tickets.
The changes, which were implemented during the first week of the year, affect both travel to Grand Central Terminal on Metro-North and travel within the city on the subway.
Here’s a look at what’s been changed.
One-way ticket expiration
One-way tickets, which could previously be activated and used for weeks after their purchase, will now expire at 4 a.m. the day after they were bought. For example, a rider who bought a one-way ticket on Sunday could use it until 4 a.m. Monday.
Day Pass
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is getting rid of round-trip tickets for Metro-North rides. Day-trippers into the city will instead buy a day pass, which will be valid for unlimited rides until 4 a.m. the next morning. For example, if a rider bought a day pass on Saturday, they can use it to travel anytime before 4 a.m. Sunday.
On weekdays, day passes cost 10% less than two one-way peak tickets. A weekday day pass to Grand Central would cost $46.75 from New Haven and $30.50 from Stamford, for example.
During weekends, day passes cost the same as two one-way off-peak tickets, which is $38.50 from New Haven to Grand Central and $25 from Stamford to Grand Central.
Metro-North ticket costs vary based on the date and time of a trip and its start and end locations, which are grouped into travel zones.
Pre-boarding ticket purchase and activation
Historically, passengers who bought a ticket while riding a Metro-North train rather than in advance have had to pay a $6 surcharge. But among the new ticket policies is a $2 increase to that surcharge, meaning it will now be $8.
Additionally, passengers who do not activate a ticket purchased in the TrainTime app before boarding their train will also be subject to an $8 charge. 
Mobile ticketing technology can tell conductors when a passenger’s ticket was activated. And if they’re subject to the surcharge, they can choose whether to pay it in the moment or defer it to their next purchase, said Michael Cortez, a spokesperson with the MTA.
“Pay-as-you-go”
Metro-North discontinued its 10-trip ticket option, and its replacement is a “pay-as-you-go” system.
After taking 10 peak or off-peak rides in a 14-day period, mobile app customers would get a free 11th one-way trip during those same 14 days. 
Riders who have earned a free ticket can use it for either a peak or off-peak trip, regardless of which ticket type(s) they purchased for their 10 trips, Cortez said — but the ticket has to be used within the same travel zones where it was earned.
Subway changes
The price of a ride on the New York City subway has risen from $2.90 to $3. 
Additionally, as of Jan. 1 riders can no longer buy a MetroCard. The city is migrating to OMNY, a tap-and-go payment system at the turnstiles, for subway payments. 
Riders can pay with a credit/debit card, their phone, or via a reloadable OMNY card, which can be purchased at subway stations. Existing MetroCards can still be used — the MTA will announce a cutoff date for accepting MetroCards later this year — but they can no longer be reloaded with funds.
MetroCard holders can transfer their card’s value to an OMNY card at a Customer Service Center.
Family trips
Metro-North has expanded eligibility for its Family Fare, which allows up to four children to ride for $1 when accompanied by a fare-paying adult.
Previously, the family fare applied to children ages 5-11 and excluded travel on trains that arrived in New York City from 6-10 a.m. on weekdays (the morning peak hours).
But as of this month, the MTR increased the eligible child age to 17 and expanded it to apply at all times of day and on all trains.
Fare increase?
There was no Metro-North fare increase in Connecticut that took effect at the beginning of this year.
However, on July 1, Metro-North prices will rise by 5%, along with prices on the CTrail Hartford Line and Shore Line East trains.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Metro-North-new-tix-machine-1024x805.jpg,,,2026-01-12 07:58:11.721940

Bonamo,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2026/01/12/governor-order-juries-criminal-convictions/,New Jersey bars people with criminal convictions from serving on juries. Gov. Phil Murphy says that is unjust.,"Gov. Phil Murphy issuing an executive order at New Hope Baptist Church in East Orange on Jan. 11, 2025, that allows people with criminal convictions to serve on juries. (Photo courtesy of the New Jersey Governor’s Office)EAST ORANGE — Gov. Phil Murphy signed an executive order Sunday that restores jury service rights to New Jerseyans with felony convictions, using his clemency powers just days before he leaves office to advance a policy initiative he said will allow juries to be “more representative of the communities they serve.”
“About 350,000 New Jerseyans, which is about 4% of our state’s population, have been denied the opportunity to perform one of the most fundamental civic duties,” Murphy said at New Hope Baptist Church in East Orange. “Today, we widen the circle of justice and acknowledge that a system cannot call itself fair if it excludes the people who have taken responsibility for their actions, rebuilt their lives, and earned their freedom.”
Moments after he signed the order, Murphy handed the pen he used to Dameon Stackhouse, who spent more than a decade in prison for robbery and is now a fellow at the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice in Newark.
“This is a pivotal moment for all of us who have faced the stigma of conviction, affirming that our contributions matter and that we are an integral part of the democratic process,” Stackhouse said. “Serving on a jury is not only a responsibility; it is a chance to participate actively in shaping the future.”

State law bars people with criminal convictions from serving on juries. The Legislature has considered legislation that would have eased the ban, but the bill never advanced in this session. It passed the Assembly in January 2024 but did not move in the Senate.
Murphy, a Democrat, has been on something of a clemency spree in his final days in office, after spending most of his two terms as governor issuing no pardons. Since December 2024, he has pardoned or commuted sentences for more than 300 people. Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D) becomes the new governor on Jan. 20.

Amol Sinha, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, applauded the move.
“People with criminal convictions who have served their sentences are as capable of serving as jurors as anyone else,” said Sinha, whose organization launched an initiative in 2024 to push for a more expansive use of the governor’s clemency powers. “Today’s executive order will help repair some of the harms caused by excluding returning citizens from this vital civic duty.”
The order allows people with convictions to serve on juries after they have completed their entire sentence, including probation and parole, if their conviction came before Jan. 10, 2026.
Sen. Michael Testa (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)
Critics of Murphy’s order believe he went beyond the reasonable bounds of his clemency powers. State Sen. Michael Testa (R-Cumberland) said Murphy with this order used those powers to bypass the Legislature, and has no legal authority to rewrite jury eligibility standards.
“Clemency exists to lessen punishment imposed on an individual. The exclusion of convicted criminals from jury service is not a punishment at all – it is a policy judgment designed to protect the integrity, impartiality, and public credibility of the judicial system,” Testa said. “Any impact on offenders is incidental to that goal, not punitive in nature, and therefore well outside the constitutional scope of the Governor’s clemency power.”
Murphy’s order notes that the governor has the power to issue a partial pardon or to restore one or more specific rights, such as the right to serve on a jury, for people who have been convicted of crimes. The order says it “shall not be considered a full pardon or remission of guilt.”
In an interview after he signed the executive order, Murphy said his clemency initiatives are “not only well within the law, but the right thing to do.”
“We have a society where if you commit a crime, you accept responsibility, you serve your time, you have every right to serve on a jury,” Murphy said. “It’s not a life sentence. It’s just not.”

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)
A bill set for final approval by the Legislature on Monday would bar social media companies from promoting certain content that could cause children to develop eating disorders, including diet product ads.
Bill sponsor Assemblywoman Andrea Katz (D-Burlington), a mom of three teenagers, said she has witnessed the impact social media has had on body-image issues.
“We have to have those safeguards in place, especially for our kids. Our social media companies make a whole lot of money off of all of our information, and so it seems to me the least they can do is protect our kids,” she said.
NJ Democrats include funding for World Cup promotion in $128M spending bill

Social media companies that violate the bill would face penalties of up to $250,000 per violation. The bill would require companies to audit themselves regularly or hire third parties to review their algorithms, designs, and features to ensure none contribute to young users developing an eating disorder. Companies wouldn’t be held accountable for photos and content uploaded by users who aren’t paid or promoted by the platform.
Darian Eletto is the chief clinical officer of behavioral health at Bergen New Bridge Medical Center in Paramus. Eletto agreed that social media platforms need restrictions to avoid exploiting children and furthering disordered eating, negative body image, or unhealthy eating behaviors.
Young people don’t always know how to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy content online, Eletto said.
“We’re seeing that shift towards that thin, thin body image being very in vogue again, which is very harmful for many of our kids and our teenagers,” she said. “We see that teenagers and adolescents are learning about these behaviors online, and no one is really talking about, ‘Hey, this is not a healthy relationship with food. This is not realistic.’”
A study from the National Institute of Health found that the constant use of social media platforms can promote addictive behavior, including disordered eating patterns. Other research has found that social media users typically report a higher dissatisfaction with their appearance.
A Harvard study found that roughly 9% of New Jerseyans, or more than 784,000 people, will have an eating disorder in their lifetime, and found that women are twice as likely to struggle with an eating disorder.
The state Senate is scheduled to vote on the bill Monday. The legislation passed out of the Assembly in December 46-24, largely along party lines.
The Senate will also consider a measure that would require the state Department of Health to study disordered eating.
“Kids today are not just exposed to unhealthy and often unrealistic body standards, they’re immersed in them nearly every day,” said bill sponsor Sen. Kristin Corrado (R-Passaic). “As students form their sense of self, constant comparisons to unrealistic expectations quietly distort how many see their own bodies, laying the groundwork for unhealthy habits.”

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Washington state lawmakers begin a 60-day session today, in which a fiscal reckoning, flood recovery, and their own reelections loom large.
They departed Olympia last spring, fingers crossed that a colossus of budget problems had been defeated with a one-two punch of spending cuts and new taxes. It was not. 
Adding to the difficulties: massive changes foisted upon states in the federal law dubbed “beautiful” by its Republican sponsors and “ugly” by its Democrat detractors.
Then came the havoc of December’s heavy rains and flooding. The financial toll for residents and public infrastructure is still being tallied. But it won’t be cheap. And it’s not clear yet that the Trump administration will step in with federal aid.
Meanwhile, Gov. Bob Ferguson came out last month in full support of an income tax on individuals earning over $1 million a year, setting up a major debate on tax policy.
Two controversial citizen initiatives are pending, but are dead on arrival in the Legislature and will likely go to voters in the fall.
Plus, policy debates are percolating on topics ranging from pennies to policing to pensions.
And it’s an election year. All 98 House seats and roughly half of the 49 Senate seats will be on ballots. Those sitting in them now know their votes in the next two months could determine if they will be back in 2027.
Here are four questions for which we don’t know the answers, yet.
How will they balance the budget?
When Ferguson arrived in office a year ago, he pegged the multi-year shortfall in the state operating budget at $12 billion, a figure he later upped to $16 billion. The first-term Democratic governor and the Democratic-run Legislature responded with spending cuts throughout state government and imposing billions of dollars in new and higher business taxes.

A year later, Ferguson says the state is facing another gap, this one at least $2.3 billion, between what Washington expects to collect in tax receipts and the amount needed to cover the state’s expenses through mid-2027. That doesn’t include the tab for the December floods.
Crafting a solution will be a challenge. Cutting deeper could undermine public services. But Republicans and others say if Democrats keep piling on taxes, it could drive people out of business or out of the state. 
Ferguson has proposed very precise cuts as a fix this time around. 
He also wants to move large sums of cash out of accounts where it’s not needed immediately. This includes using $569 million of Climate Commitment Act revenue to cover the expense of the Working Families Tax Credit for low- and middle-income households, and a proposal to siphon $1 billion from the state’s rainy day reserve fund. 
Some Democrats are skeptical of using that much of the climate money on the tax credits, rather than spending it to reduce air pollution. Republicans balk at the rainy day fund drawdown.
Legislative budget writers will put out their blueprints in late February.
Will progressives get their income tax?
Ferguson delivered arguably the session’s biggest news before the opening day gavel.
It came last month with his call for taxing the income of those earning more than a million dollars a year. This is the same governor whose preaching of austerity at his inauguration 12 months ago drew glares from Democratic legislators.
Those turned to scowls when he publicly and privately rejected Democratic proposals for a so-called “wealth tax,” a statewide payroll tax on large employers and a higher cap on annual property tax collections by local governments.

With his embrace of an income tax, progressives’ frowns may be easing. But Ferguson attached strings to his support. That makes some of them wary of whether he’ll sign what is sent to him — presuming something is passed.
To survive, the tax will need to be designed to withstand an inevitable court challenge. Lawmakers are also looking at how to possibly funnel money from the tax to the Working Families Tax Credit or to underwrite various other forms of targeted tax relief. Deciding how to use the revenue could further complicate the debate. 
There are election-year realities, too. While the governor is not on the ballot this year, most of the Democrats who would need to vote for the tax will be.
Will Heywood’s initiatives factor in?
Let’s Go Washington, the political committee led by hedge fund manager Brian Heywood, has become a perennial thorn in the side of majority Democrats in Olympia. The group is back this year with a new set of initiatives.
One would roll back changes Democrats made last year to the group’s 2024 parental bill of rights initiative. The other would bar transgender athletes from competing in girls’ sports.

These are initiatives to the Legislature, meaning they go to lawmakers for consideration before possibly ending up on the ballot. Top Democrats made clear Friday that the initiatives will not get a hearing in the House or Senate this session, all but guaranteeing that they’ll go to voters to decide in November. 
While the initiatives may be blocked legislatively, they could still pop up in the form of protests at the Capitol, or with Republicans finding ways to hammer on the wedge, culture war issues involved with an eye toward Election Day.
How will Ferguson fare?
Ferguson got off to a rocky start during his first session as governor, with staff drama and many Democrats miffed as he made a show of reaching out to Republicans and as he reined in progressive tax proposals.
This session is a moment when Ferguson will either succeed or fail in showing he’s a force that can drive the conversation and the priorities in Olympia.

Backing the income tax on high earners should build some goodwill among members on his party’s left flank, but it’ll also put him front and center in a Republican narrative that Washington Democrats are out of control on spending and have an endless appetite for taxes.
During last year’s session, Ferguson could readily fall back on the assertion that he inherited a budget blueprint — and budget troubles — from his predecessor, Jay Inslee. That kind of deflection will become increasingly difficult moving forward, as what’s happening now is squarely on his watch.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1688-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-12 07:12:15.904943

Garlin Gilchrist, the state's first Black lieutenant governor, announced his campaign for governor on March 11, 2025. | Kyle DavidsonLt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist’s bid to replace Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has come to an end, but he’s setting his sights, instead, on becoming the Democratic Party’s nominee for secretary of state.
Gilchrist announced that he was bowing out of the gubernatorial hunt in a video released Monday morning, which also served as his launching pad to seek the office that oversees the state’s elections and some of its key administrative operations.
It was rumored for weeks that Gilchrist would end up dropping out of the gubernatorial race. He faced an uphill battle as the No. 2 name in that race, with Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson in pole position both in terms of Democratic enthusiasm and money raised.



Democratic sources told Michigan Advance last week that a change of pace was coming soon for Gilchrist. As those rumors swirled, Bridge Detroit reported on Sunday that Gilchrist was making calls to Democratic officials about his change of candidacy. 
On Monday morning, he made his intentions to seek the secretary of state position known. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“At heart, I’m a public servant, an entrepreneur, a dad, a husband, and an engineer who spent a lot of my life making government actually work for people,” Gilchrist said in a campaign video. “I’m not done with that, not by a long shot. You’ve told your stories about the high cost of everything and the threats to our democracy. You sounded the alarm about this president who acts like a king. And you know Michigan has been ground zero in the battle for free and fair elections before, and it will be again. This tangled web of corruption and control is meant to crush our power to participate. We have to fix this. If we don’t, we can’t fix anything else.”
Gilchrist said those issues compelled him to join the secretary of state race. He thanked those who supported him in his bid for governor, a race that has now become a two-person contest between Benson and Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson.
“The time for me to serve in that role may come, but now is not that time,” Gilchrist said of his gubernatorial race before turning to the secretary race. “As Secretary of State, I will shine a light on dark money and put the public first. I will modernize licensing and registration by providing smart, 21st-century service. I’ll protect your privacy and never allow your identity, voter registration information, or license plate data to be mined by big tech companies or surveilled by the Trump administration. And I will hold accountable companies that rip you off when you get your car fixed.”
Gilchrist went on to say that the problem with politics, as he sees it, is that “it’s rigged toward the people with the most wealth.”
“They want us to give up, and check out. But we won’t,” Gilchrist said. “Our right to vote gives each of us an equal voice in our future. We can’t let anyone take that right away.”
Repositioning to the secretary of state race has its pros and cons.
On one hand, Gilchrist won’t have to collect nominating petition signatures to appear on the ballot or go through the primary process to seek the Democratic Party nomination. Those candidates are, however, selected at the party’s convention following the August primary. That means a potentially easier path to the nomination, but only if Gilchrist is playing to win and has support from the state’s big-name unions, like United Auto Workers, which largely decide the Democratic nominations later in the summer.
Gilchrist’s campaign believes that it can galvanize that support.
But the race is already crowded and the lieutenant governor faces a deeper slate of competition than he did against Benson and Swanson. The party’s use of an earlier endorsement convention in the spring to rally support around the most likely candidate to win — based on enthusiasm but also organizing strength for general election fight — also means that Gilchrist has to get moving.
Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum, Deputy Secretary of State Aghogho Edevbie, former state Sen. Adam Hollier and former Michigan State Lottery Commissioner Suzanna Shkreli are also seeking the nomination. Hollier and Shkreli only recently entered the race, but Byrum and Edevbie have been in the hunt since mid-2025.
Shkreli started trying to stake out deeper ground in the race on Sunday by exoling how she’s gained momentum fast after being in the race only a month, and by also taking a jab at Gilchrist as he enters the fray.
“This office and protecting our vote is too important to be a consolation prize, and I am the best candidate to hold this seat come November,” Shkreli said in a statement. “With my experience as a prosecutor and in the Governor’s administration, I bring the grit and toughness to stand up to extremists and protect the votes and voices of Michiganders no matter what comes our way.”

Matt Lehman, R-Berne, seeks to limit certain civil lawsuits and jury awards in Indiana. (Photo by Monroe Bush for Indiana Capital Chronicle)A newly formed lobbying group backed by Indiana’s major business organizations is pressing lawmakers to pass a civil justice bill that would cap non-economic damages, restrict public nuisance lawsuits and shield businesses from certain liability claims.
Democrats have already criticized the bill as solving problems Indiana does not have while limiting the rights of injured Hoosiers.
The Indiana Alliance for Legal Reform, announced late last month, is endorsing House Bill 1417, filed last week by Rep. Matt Lehman, R-Berne.
Lehman said he authored the bill after identifying what he views as weaknesses in Indiana’s civil justice system that expose businesses and property owners to liability even when they’re not negligent.

“It’s just trying to find the areas of our judicial system that I think are in some cases being abused, and trying to put some parameters on,” Lehman told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “We don’t want to call into question the courts. At the same time, we’ve got to restrict some of the people that are getting dragged into the courts that have no negligence.”
The bill bundles several proposals aligned with the alliance’s goal of curbing what the group describes as frivolous lawsuits and excessive jury awards against Hoosier businesses.
The alliance counts the Indiana Chamber of Commerce, Indiana Manufacturers Association, National Federation of Independent Business, Indiana Motor Truck Association and Indiana Bankers Association among its supporters, said executive director Stephen Wolff. Former Senate President Pro Tem David Long has been retained to assist with government and media outreach.
Wolff said the group formed amid growing concern among business leaders about national litigation trends and a desire for what he has described as “common-sense reform” of Indiana’s civil code that would balance the system while preserving the state’s business climate.
“The Alliance’s goal is to ensure that Indiana has a legal environment that is fair to business and provides the predictability they need to invest in Indiana,” Wolff said. “The business associations and companies that comprise the Alliance recognize that the goal will be accomplished over multiple years and are committed to seeing it through. HB 1417 moves us one step closer to that goal.”
But Rep. Ed DeLaney, D-Indianapolis, a longtime attorney, said the proposal reflects a misunderstanding of Indiana’s legal system.
“I practiced in Indiana, where we have generally fairly cautious juries,” DeLaney said. “We have higher courts which would turn back any excessive awards. So, I don’t think we have the problem that other states may have.”
Limits on civil cases
House Bill 1417 was referred to the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday but has yet to get a hearing date.
The proposal would cap non-economic damages — such as pain and suffering — at $1 million in all civil cases. Judges and juries would still calculate non-economic damages without regard to the cap, but courts would be required to reduce awards exceeding $1 million and allocate the capped damages proportionally among defendants based on fault.
Current Indiana law does not impose a general cap on compensatory damages in civil cases against private businesses.
Limits do exist for punitive damages, however — capped at three times compensatory damages or $50,000, whichever is greater — as well as in medical malpractice cases and lawsuits against government entities.
The bill would also substantially narrow public nuisance claims. 
Language in the measure defines a public nuisance as an “ongoing and unlawful condition” that interferes with an “established public right” and is expressly prohibited by state or federal law. Activities permitted by law, ordinance or court order could not be considered public nuisances.










We don't want Indiana to become a magnet for litigation but rather want to provide Hoosier businesses and those looking to locate in Indiana with the kind of stable environment they need.


– Stephen Wolff, executive director of the Indiana Alliance for Legal Reform


Government entities would be limited to seeking court orders to stop or fix an unlawful condition and would be barred from recovering monetary damages or costs tied to potential future harm. Private individuals could still seek compensation, but only under more limited circumstances.
Another provision would prohibit lawsuits against property owners, business owners or third-party business operators for criminal acts committed by someone else on their property or premises. The bill would also bar claims brought by individuals who committed the criminal act themselves.
The bill would additionally prohibit transportation network company riders — such as users of ride-hailing services like Uber or Lyft — from bringing claims against the company, or TNC, for injuries caused by a driver or occurring during a ride.
A legislative fiscal analysis estimates the changes could reduce court caseloads and lower state and local expenditures tied to civil litigation, while also decreasing court fee revenue if fewer cases were filed.
Indiana has enacted several business-friendly tort reforms in recent years, including new transparency requirements for third-party litigation funding and limits on how lenders can interact with attorneys and medical providers. 
State lawmakers tightened the rules last year with House Bill 1160, also authored by Lehman, which bars lawsuit lenders from paying referral fees to lawyers or medical providers, forbids steering plaintiffs to specific providers and requires disclosure of third-party litigation financing, while also restricting some foreign investment in Indiana lawsuits.
Need ‘more to sue a business’
Wolff said the alliance is focused on limiting what it views as expansions of liability that go beyond illegal conduct and expose businesses to unpredictable and substantial legal risks.
“When we are talking about frivolous cases, we are talking about things like public nuisance actions, which are traditionally brought to resolve conditions that are illegal by ordinance, and adversely impact the public or create a condition that undermines public health and safety,” Wolff said. “Lately, these cases have been extended to legal activities.”
He cited lawsuits targeting manufacturers over products that criminals find easy to misuse.
Court actions against automakers such as Hyundai and Kia have become a frequent example cited by tort reform advocates.
Cities, including Indianapolis, joined a federal lawsuit alleging the companies should be held liable for vehicle thefts because certain models lacked industry-standard anti-theft technology, even though the vehicles complied with existing federal safety and manufacturing requirements at the time they were sold. The lawsuit was eventually settled last fall.
Story continues below.
HB1417.01.INTR
 
Other reforms lobbied for by the alliance are aimed at lawsuits involving criminal activity on private property.
“Other frivolous lawsuits involve cases brought by criminals injured during the conduct of illegal behavior that sue the owner of the premises where the criminal’s illegal activity took place,” Wolff said. “That’s untenable, and there needs to be language added requiring more to sue a business in such a situation.”
On damages, Wolff emphasized the alliance is not targeting compensation for medical bills or lost wages.
“We are not talking about set costs, such as medical bills or lost wages, which are compensatory,” he said. “We are talking about undefined damages.”
The alliance also says it wants to ensure Indiana does not become a haven for litigation. Wolff pointed to a high-profile “nuclear verdict” involving Indiana-based Wabash Trailer Manufacturing Co., though that case was decided by a Missouri jury.
“It shows what can happen with an imbalanced and unpredictable legal system,” Wolff said. “We don’t want Indiana to become a magnet for litigation but rather want to provide Hoosier businesses and those looking to locate in Indiana with the kind of stable environment they need.”
Pushback from Democrats
DeLaney said he believes the bill addresses problems Indiana does not have — while undermining the core principles of tort law. He was particularly critical of the non-economic damages cap.

“You can completely destroy my life, put me on a pump for the rest of my life, make it so I’m a quadriplegic and I can only get my medical bills paid,” he said. “I can’t get non-economic damages. I can’t for the pain, the suffering, the misery imposed upon me and my family.”
He also questioned the provision shielding transportation network companies from liability.
“If the Uber company is aware that the driver that they’ve contracted with has got all kinds of problems, has a criminal record and so forth, and then injures me, they’re not liable,” DeLaney said. “I cannot think that that’s in the public interest.”
DeLaney added that Indiana courts already have tools to address lawsuits involving crimes on private property and to limit excessive verdicts.
“We already have both common law and statutory law in this state that covers these issues,” he said. “This is what I call a lobbyist bill.”
Still, DeLaney said he doubts the bill will advance far in a short legislative session.
“I don’t think this should go anywhere,” he said. “This cannot be a high priority for anybody.”

(Getty Images)AJ spent most of 6th grade skipping class. Triggered by even small tasks, like being asked to write guided notes during instruction, AJ entered my 7th grade social studies class academically behind and discouraged. Reading at an early-elementary level, I needed to earn his trust and give him tools to succeed.
With help from AJ’s incredible one-on-one paraprofessional, we focused on small wins. I learned AJ’s favorite candy was Starburst and my usual mints wouldn’t cut it. I broke lessons into manageable parts and we numbered and highlighted readings so he could connect with new social studies content, including unfamiliar topics far beyond the limits of the city he’d never left. Together, we built his confidence, celebrated progress, and made learning accessible. By midyear, AJ was staying in class, raising his hand, and earning passing grades.
His success meant everything to me. The year before — my first as a middle school teacher after six years teaching high school — I nearly quit the profession, convinced I wasn’t cut out for the classroom. My lessons fell flat, my students weren’t learning, and I felt like I was failing them. I had been used to struggling alone, but after raising the challenges to my team, I received real support from my colleagues, instructional coaches, and administrators. They taught me how to embed evidence-based reading strategies, filling gaps for students like AJ who needed fluency and vocabulary instruction.
Because of their support and collaboration, my students grew, and I grew with them, becoming both a social studies and literacy teacher. AJ’s progress shows what teachers can do when they’re supported, mentored, and given time to collaborate.










Teacher leaders when nurtured, compensated, and trusted don’t just improve classrooms. They change entire schools.


In 2024, only 32% of my school’s students passed the English portion of the ILEARN assessment and 48% were below proficiency. This past Spring, 42% passed and only 39% scored below proficiency. These improvements occurred because of our principal’s emphasis on collaboration, planning, and data-driven professional development through our work with the National Institute for Excellence in Teaching, and a shared commitment to student and teacher growth as part of our new Instructional Leadership Team (ILT).
Because of this support structure, I now lead teams, collaborate across the district, and even participate in a teaching fellowship. My colleagues mentor peers, lead professional learning, and analyze data. These opportunities help keep teachers in the classroom and build a pipeline of support for incoming teachers, yet almost none of this comes with additional compensation.
Like many teacher leaders, I’ve taken on more because it’s good for students. But teaching in 2025 is harder than ever and doing more with less isn’t sustainable for retaining excellent educators or supporting teachers who are still learning the job.
‘Harder to keep teachers’: Indiana fiscal policy panel weighs salary gaps, educator shortage

Earlier this year, Indiana updated the Teacher Appreciation Grant (TAG) to now allow districts to use these specific state-provided funds to compensate teachers for leadership roles, not just performance. This shift could enable districts to pay mentors, instructional coaches, and team leaders for the critical work they already do.
This is a game-changer: it paves the way for districts to create career pathways that keep experts in the classroom at a time when many teachers are questioning staying in the career altogether. As districts start to share plans, teachers should continue to inform the process and advocate for a clear, transparent, and well-defined plan for how dollars can support collaboration in their district. Teachers should view this as a crucial opportunity to advocate for systems that truly value the expertise and leadership that make schools successful.
Traditional salary schedules reward longevity, not necessarily impact. If we want better outcomes for students like AJ, districts must invest in the teachers who make that happen. TAG funds create a pathway to do so—and teachers should be at the table shaping those decisions. Research shows that teachers stay when they feel supported and part of a community. Leveraging state funding to create compensated leadership roles strengthens both. When new teachers have mentors and accomplished teachers are recognized with meaningful, well-defined roles and pay, schools become places where everyone grows.
AJ is now in high school, and I couldn’t be prouder of him. The tools I gained through coaching and collaboration are the same ones I now share with colleagues, who use them with their own struggling readers. Intentional support made me a better teacher for AJ and so many others. It also made me a teacher leader. And teacher leaders when nurtured, compensated, and trusted don’t just improve classrooms. They change entire schools.

(Photo courtesy of U.S. Bureau of Land Management)When the director of a state agency asks the governor to investigate the citizen commission that oversees him, the public should pause. When that request follows years of documented leadership failures, ignored audits, and preventable deaths, the concern should deepen.
That is where Washington now finds itself with the Department of Fish and Wildlife.
In August, Director Kelly Susewind asked Gov. Bob Ferguson to initiate an investigation into members of the Washington Fish and Wildlife Commission, citing concerns raised through emails and text messages obtained by a national advocacy organization representing hunting interests. That investigation — now expected to stretch into 2026 — has cast a long shadow over the commission’s work, chilling its ability to function as an independent oversight body.
What has not received comparable scrutiny is the leadership record that preceded it.
The public record is clear. In January 2018, the Legislature commissioned the Matrix Consulting Group to conduct an organizational assessment of the Department of Fish and Wildlife. Its findings were stark: deep structural dysfunction, a toxic workplace culture, weak accountability, and leadership failures that put employees and the agency’s mission at risk. That report was delivered just months before Kelly Susewind was appointed director.
Three years later, in September 2021, the Washington state auditor released its own independent performance audit, “Assessing the Workplace Culture at the Department of Fish and Wildlife.” Based on extensive interviews and surveys of staff, the auditor confirmed what the Matrix report had already identified: widespread bullying, fear of retaliation, breakdowns in communication, and a profound lack of confidence in executive leadership’s willingness to correct course.
The auditor’s conclusion was explicit: real change would require sustained commitment from leadership. Without it, trust would continue to erode.
That commitment never materialized.
Two years after the auditor’s report was released, Dr. Erin Peterson, a 31-year-old fisheries biologist and mother, drowned while conducting solo fieldwork for the department on the Wind River. She lacked adequate safety training and basic protective equipment. Four months later, Mary Valentine, a veteran scientific technician at the agency, drowned under strikingly similar circumstances while working alone at a fish trap on the Duckabush River.
Washington’s Department of Labor and Industries later cited the Department of Fish and Wildlife for willful serious safety violations — the most severe category available — meaning management knew the risks and failed to act. More than $230,000 in penalties followed. These were not freak accidents. They were foreseeable outcomes of a leadership culture that failed to respond to repeated warnings.
Yet in the wake of these tragedies, there was no meaningful public reckoning. No demand for accountability from agency leadership. No executive pause to ask why independent audits had gone unheeded. No clear acknowledgment that the system itself had failed the people working within it.
Instead, public attention has shifted toward scrutinizing the commission.
Recent reporting shows that the investigation has already grown from an original $40,000 contract to at least $64,000, with the potential for additional cost if it continues into 2026. These are public dollars — spent not to address documented executive leadership failures, but to examine the conduct of the citizen body charged with oversight.
The origin of the complaints that precipitated this investigation also matters. They stem largely from a national hunting advocacy organization based in Ohio that has aggressively targeted Washington Fish and Wildlife Commissioners since 2022, following the commission’s decision to halt spring black bear hunting — a decision widely supported by Washington residents.
Whether one agrees with that policy outcome or not, it is troubling that an out-of-state pressure campaign has helped drive an expensive inquiry, while repeated in-state warnings about leadership failures and employee safety went unaddressed.
This inversion of accountability should concern anyone who cares about effective governance.
The Fish and Wildlife Commission exists to provide independent oversight — to represent the public trust, not to shield executive management from scrutiny. When a director initiates an investigation into his own oversight body while his leadership record remains largely unexamined, the integrity of that system is put at risk.
This is not about emails. It is not about personalities. And it is not about politics.
It is about whether Washington is willing to confront documented leadership failure — or continue to protect it.
Accountability must follow the evidence. In this case, the evidence points to years of ignored audits, uncorrected safety hazards, and a workplace culture whose consequences were fatal.
Oversight should not be punished. Whistle-blowers should not be sidelined. And preventable deaths should never be met with silence.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/coho-salmon.jpeg,,,2026-01-12 07:12:15.904943

Voters will choose between Democratic nominee Judith Taylor, the chair of the Tuscaloosa Democratic Party, and Republican nominee Norman Crow, a Tuscaloosa City Councilman.
The seat in House District 63 opened after Rep. Cynthia Almond, R-Tuscaloosa, resigned to become the president of the Alabama Public Service Commission.

The district in recent elections has been solidly Republican. Almond got 66% of the vote in 2022. Former Rep. Bill Poole, R-Tuscaloosa, who represented the district before becoming state finance director in 2021, got 63% of the vote in 2010 and faced no opposition in 2014 or 2018.
Taylor said in an interview on Thursday that she’s running to make change in her district.
“There are so many needs that we need to address, and the Alabama representatives that are in Montgomery are going to have to stand up for the people in their areas, in their districts, and so many of them have been so quiet, and it’s concerning,” she said.
Taylor said wants to prioritize improving public education which could reduce crime rate across the state.
“If you look into the results of better education for young people and better job opportunities for new graduates out of high school,” she said. “How does that affect the crime rate? I think it would lower the crime rate if people had a better opportunity, and I’d much rather build more schools and spend more money financing schooling than prisons,” Taylor said.
Another one of her priorities is affordable health care.
“I think affordable health care is something America should be able to solve, and I think that the least expensive way to do it is as a group, and then our hospitals wouldn’t be closing,” Taylor said.
Since 2009, nine rural hospitals have closed in Alabama. The most recent closure happened last year.
Messages seeking comment from Crow were left on Friday. 
In an interview with the Reflector in June, with the Reflector, Crow cited education as a priority. 
“Continuing to work to improve education in the state of Alabama is so important to prepare our students, but also adults, for the jobs of tomorrow,” he said.
He also said in the interview that running for the seat is a “huge opportunity” for him to serve his community on a state level furthering his passion for public service.
Taylor said voters should choose her because she will try to solve the problems of her constituents.
“I don’t think you can solve financial problems without solving social problems. I think those two things have to go hand in hand,” she said.

Women denied miscarriage treatment have been investigated or charged for how they disposed of fetal remains. Hundreds have been charged for using illegal, legal, and prescribed  substances while pregnant, even when their babies were born healthy or their miscarriages or stillbirths were likely caused by other conditions, like infections. Women have been charged for self-managing their abortions, even where laws ostensibly exempt them from prosecution.   
Thankfully, we haven’t seen this in Missouri. So far.
A report released last year by Pregnancy Justice that catalogs these cases in the period from the Dobbs decision in June 2022 to June 2024 doesn’t include any in Missouri. Pregnancy Justice’s Dana Sussman cautioned me that this doesn’t mean it didn’t happen, and noted that we do have a pre-Dobbs history of arrests of pregnant and postpartum women, including ten cases in their 2023 report covering January 2006 to June 2022.
It’s good news that we haven’t seen the kinds of post-Dobbs cases that other states have. Unfortunately, I expect that is largely because our succession of anti-abortion attorneys general, and local prosecutors who share their goals, have been deterred by the Reproductive Freedom Initiative being on the ballot in 2024, and subsequently becoming law.
I suspect prosecutors didn’t want to raise the salience of what it meant for abortion to be a crime in Missouri before we voted on the initiative to enshrine reproductive freedom in our constitution (I’ll call that “Original Amendment 3”). Now that Missouri’s constitution protects individuals from prosecution for the alleged or actual outcomes of their pregnancies, prosecutors should see such cases as destined to fail.
Still, many of the cases Pregnancy Justice has documented involve situations where the law didn’t justify the charges, but prosecutors brought them anyway. Missouri’s anti-abortion prosecutors, however, can’t risk the bad publicity that could come from going after a woman blamed for her miscarriage or alleged to have self-managed her abortion because it could jeopardize our Republican legislators’ effort to repeal Original Amendment 3 via their New Amendment 3, which will recriminalize abortion unless voters vote it down this year.
The protection we have from criminalization under our hard won current law is vital to the health and liberty of Missourians, but it has been dismissed by anti-abortion leaders who refuse to acknowledge the documented harm to patients that Missouri’s criminal ban caused. Even a handful of abortion rights advocates who opposed the strategy of re-establishing abortion access via the ballot have ignored the importance of these new protections. 
As numerous articles have documented, broad access to abortion has not been restored in the year since the passage of Original Amendment 3. Many of these articles frame this as a surprise and a disappointment. 
It may be disappointing, but it is by no means a surprise. Advocates were not operating under the illusion that abortion care would be widely available the day after the vote. We anticipated a long slog.
First, you have to sue the state to have “Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers,” a.k.a. “TRAP laws,” struck down. TRAP laws are medically inappropriate regulations disguised as health protections that have been enacted by anti-abortion officials in order to make it impossible for abortion clinics to function. Missouri’s TRAP laws are the reason abortion care was nearly eliminated in Missouri prior to the overturning of Roe.  
Why a particular TRAP law is medically inappropriate can be pretty technical, and not at all obvious to the average person — or judge. In their lawsuit seeking to invalidate the many TRAP laws on the books in our state, Missouri’s ACLU and Planned Parenthood affiliates succeeded in convincing the court to preliminarily enjoin (that is, pause) a number of regulations while the litigation proceeds, allowing some abortion care to resume. 
But the court declined to enjoin other TRAP laws that continue to make it impossible to expand access, especially to medication abortion. With the benefit of a trial beginning today that will include expert testimony, the court should enjoin the remaining regulations because the Missouri constitution now imposes a “super-strict scrutiny” standard that puts the burden on the state to prove that a regulation actually has a health benefit and is consistent with clinical standards. 
If the trial court gets it right, it still won’t be over because the state will likely appeal. 
Second, once a state’s abortion care infrastructure has been decimated, a legal win can’t restore it overnight. Clinics close and medical professionals leave. Even with a perfect ruling from the Missouri Supreme Court, rebuilding will take not only time and money, but providers who are willing to endure ongoing attacks from our anti-abortion supermajority in the legislature and other state officials.
Like I said, it’s gonna be a slog, during which many Missourians will have to continue to rely on out-of-state providers. That’s no reason not to fight the fight. Nor to dismiss how essential the protections that are in place today thanks to Original Amendment 3 are, which New Amendment 3 would eliminate.
Legal abortion does not equal accessible abortion. But legality has already made Missouri significantly less dangerous, even while abortion access remains limited. This is for two reasons: (1) hospitals are significantly less likely to deny or delay care for patients experiencing miscarriages due to the amendment’s protections against prosecution of medical professionals, and (2) Missourians are protected from criminal penalties for having abortions via telemedicine or self-management, and for experiencing miscarriages or stillbirths. 
As to miscarriage treatment, I can’t promise you that every hospital has stopped delaying care or sending patients out of state and putting patients at risk of sepsis, loss of future fertility or death. Hospitals don’t typically make their legal guidance to medical providers public. But any decent hospital attorney should be advising that the Missouri Constitution now essentially eliminates the risk of prosecution for providing miscarriage care and provides a seemingly airtight defense in the unlikely case of a prosecutor going rogue and bringing charges anyway. 
I am aware of hospitals and medical practices who have indeed updated their guidance.
As to the threat of criminalization of Missourians who self-induce their abortions or have adverse pregnancy outcomes, I cannot overstate how important the protections are that we established with Original Amendment 3 and stand to lose with New Amendment 3. 
The vast majority of abortions occurring in Missouri today are either via telemedicine, that is, medical providers providing remote care from states with shield laws through organizations like Aid Access; or via self-management, in which individuals procure abortion medication without the assistance of a medical provider. 
Before Original Amendment 3, telemedicine or self-management were legally risky, exposing abortion-seekers to law enforcement involvement or threats of it from abusive partners, family members or hospital staff. 
Many in the anti-abortion movement deny any desire to see women prosecuted for having abortions. Missouri’s now invalidated ban exempted “a woman upon whom an abortion is performed” from prosecution for a “conspiracy” to violate the ban. But that left room to charge someone who was not part of a “conspiracy” because she self-induced.
The threat is real. Women are being prosecuted across the country. Missouri has long been at the forefront of anti-abortion legislation. We have a fetal personhood law on the books that was upheld in 1989 by a less fanatically anti-abortion U.S Supreme Court than we have today.  State Sen. Mike Moon has once again introduced a bill that would subject women who have abortions to homicide charges. 
Missouri’s attorney general has concurrent jurisdiction over abortion prosecutions, which means that if your local prosecutor has no interest in prosecuting abortion seekers, the attorney general can. 
Our new attorney general, Catherine Hanaway, recently demonstrated her enthusiasm for harsh criminal penalties for abortion by citing the Comstock Act multiple times in a recent court filing. The Comstock Act is an 1873 federal anti-vice law that was the subject of backlash at the time and hasn’t been enforced in over a century. It states that “every article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion, or for any indecent or immoral use, shall not be conveyed in the mails” (Emphasis mine).
Today’s anti-abortion extremists are pushing the novel (to put it lightly) legal theory that the Comstock Act currently makes it punishable by up to five years in prison to provide or obtain any abortion anywhere in this country because abortion can’t be provided without medication or medical instruments transported by mail or common carrier. Hanaway’s office did not respond to a request for comment as to whether her filing should be read to indicate she holds this maximalist view.
In the days before Roe, few providers were prosecuted for providing abortions and even fewer women were prosecuted for having them. That was another time, very different from our age of mass incarceration and surveillance. “Prosecutors are gonna prosecute,” Sussman told me, “pregnancy loss has become more and more suspect, as is any action someone does or doesn’t take during pregnancy.” 
The legal protections already in place thanks to our Reproductive Freedom amendment are vital, and no one should downplay the consequences of losing them if New Amendment 3 succeeds.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051425_abortionaccess1-1024x615.jpg,,,2026-01-12 06:58:03.719837

Kendrick A. Simpson, 45, is set to die by lethal injection on Feb. 12 at Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester. 
He could be the first inmate executed in Oklahoma this year.
A clemency hearing is set for Wednesday before the five-member Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board.
He was sentenced to death for the 2006 shooting deaths of Glen Palmer, 20, and Anthony Jones, 19, in Oklahoma City.

Simpson, a felon prohibited from possessing guns, used an AK-style assault rifle and shot 20 times at the car carrying the victims.
“Kendrick Simpson hunted his victims, executed them without hesitation, and then boasted about what he had done,” said Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond. “The families left behind have endured unimaginable pain, and nothing in Simpson’s decades on death row has shown that he deserved the mercy he refused to give others.”
Simpson is expected to argue that he suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder after being the victim in a 2004 shooting in New Orleans and because he was a child victim of sexual abuse. 
Prosecutors say the PTSD, if he has it, does not explain or excuse the murders.
Simpson is also expected to go into details about a traumatic childhood that included violence and drugs. His attorneys allege he had an “anemic defense,” which failed to show the jury the truth about his history.
According to his clemency packet, Simpson is “profoundly remorseful,” and takes responsibility.
He is asking the panel to “look at the whole of his life rather than a snapshot of the worst thing he has ever done and show mercy,” according to his clemency packet.
If the panel recommends clemency, Gov. Kevin Stitt will make the final decision.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The Milwaukee Police Department says it doesn’t have a plan in place if federal immigration authorities mobilize into the city at a scale similar to operations in nearby Chicago and Minneapolis. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement launched one of the largest operations in its history last week, sending about 2,000 agents into the Twin Cities. That mobilization resulted in an ICE agent shooting and killing 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good Wednesday morning in Minneapolis. Minneapolis schools were closed Thursday because, in a separate incident, ICE agents deployed tear gas at a high school as students were being dismissed.
Late last year, ICE’s “Operation Midway Blitz” similarly sent a large number of federal agents into the Chicago area. While the operation was underway, ICE and other federal agents killed a 38-year-old Mexican man during a traffic stop and in another incident rammed into the car of a woman who was warning neighbors about ICE presence before shooting her five times. 
The Chicago operation included at least another dozen incidents in which federal agents pointed their guns or fired less-lethal weapons at residents, according to data compiled by The Trace. 
In both cities, the massive presence of immigration authorities has caused significant ripple effects through local communities, straining the ability of local law enforcement to control crowds of observers and protesters and respond to the disruptions in traffic caused by caravans of federal SUVs traveling over city streets. 
“Local police departments and many state governors have been very firm in their communication to federal law enforcement that federal law enforcement is not welcome in their cities conducting these sorts of major operations because of the fact that it is so disruptive,” says Ingrid Eagly, a law professor at UCLA who focuses on immigration enforcement. “Because people you know can be injured and harmed, and communities are living in fear. It’s causing a great amount of disruption in communities to have this kind of strong law enforcement presence.” 
In cities across the country where ICE agents have been deployed in large numbers, local officials have had to decide how local cops engage with the operations and what that engagement communicates to local residents. Eagly says that operating as “a backup service for unprepared ICE agents” would be using local resources to legitimize ICE’s presence. 
“To send in local law enforcement, as backup, as sort of part of the enforcement team, would be essentially being part of the of the federal police force conducting ICE operations,” she says.
The operations in Chicago and Minneapolis, two largely Democratic Midwestern cities  that are frequent targets of rhetorical attacks by Republicans, are prominent displays of force in communities similar to Milwaukee. Even though Wisconsin has so far avoided the brunt of the Trump administration’s stepped-up immigration enforcement efforts, that could change. 
Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel that the city had to be prepared for the “eventuality” that an ICE surge is coming.
“Given what happened [Wednesday] and the young woman who was killed by a federal agent in Minneapolis, we got to prepare on the ground,” Johnson said.
But when asked if the Milwaukee Police had a plan for managing a potential ICE operation in the city, a spokesperson for the department only pointed to the department’s existing immigration policy. 
The department’s immigration policy states that Milwaukee Police officers are not allowed to cooperate with ICE’s civil immigration enforcement actions. 
“Proactive immigration enforcement by local police can be detrimental to our mission and policing philosophy when doing so deters some individuals from participating in their civic obligation to assist the police,” the policy states. 
But the written policy does not include any provisions for how police personnel should respond in the event of massive ICE presence in the community. Having a noncooperation or “sanctuary” policy could make Milwaukee a target for Trump’s mass deportation program. Despite that, when pressed for clarification because the policy does not state now the department would manage the fallout of an ICE surge, the spokesperson refused to answer.
“It states what our policy [is] in regards to immigration enforcement,” a Milwaukee police spokesperson said in an unsigned email on Tuesday, before the Minneapolis incident. “We do not have an operation like Chicago therefore cannot provide information about a policy of something that we do not have in our city.” 
Pressed again for an answer to the specific question about managing the traffic and crowd control implications of a massive ICE operation in Milwaukee, the spokesperson again refused to answer. 
“We have an immigration enforcement policy just because you do not like the answer does not mean we are going to answer different to you,” the spokesperson wrote. 
After the shooting in Minneapolis, in answer to a follow-up question from the Examiner, the MPD spokesperson again cited the department’s existing policy preventing cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)More than seven years after Idaho voters approved Medicaid expansion, the Republican supermajority-controlled Legislature is still talking about repealing it.
In the past, repeal bills haven’t gone that far. But this year seems different — since the state is facing multimillion projected budget shortfalls after years of tax cuts, Idaho’s DOGE committee recommended repeal, and even Idaho House Speaker Mike Moyle is open to the idea.

“Heck yeah (it’s on the table),” Moyle told the Idaho Capital Sun last week. “I don’t have a problem with that. Everything is on the table. I don’t have a problem with that at all.”
The debate over repealing expansion has largely settled into two camps: Some Republican lawmakers complain that expansion is much more expensive than initial projections, and that it could eat into the state’s budget for other services such as education. 
But opponents say expansion has saved lives, repealing it wouldn’t save the state money since the feds pay so much into the program and the policy saves state money in other areas. They also say repeal could jeopardize the state’s health care system in ways that everyone — not just the almost 90,000 Idahoans on expansion — would feel.
That’s pretty much what folks have been saying for years. 
“It’s Groundhogs Day,” Idaho Cancer Society Cancer Action Network government relations director Randy Johnson said in an interview. 
What’s frustrating, he added, is that “we’re spending so much time on talking about repeal, we never get to the real issue: What is driving up health care costs?”

 What is Medicaid expansion? And how did it close the ‘Medicaid gap’?

Under the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, the federal government incentivized states to expand Medicaid to a broader range of low-income earners by offering to cover Medicaid expansion policies at a higher federal matching rate of 90%. 
Idaho was one of several states that didn’t expand Medicaid.
Idaho Republican lawmakers have long worried states would be left to pay higher costs for expansion if the federal government reduced its extra pay. 
But by not expanding Medicaid, tens of thousands of Idahoans were left in a medical insurance assistance gap, dubbed the Medicaid gap. People in the gap earned too much to qualify for Medicaid, but too little to qualify for tax subsidies on Idaho’s health insurance marketplace, Your Health Idaho. 
Medicaid expansion set one eligibility cap for everyone: 138% of the federal poverty level, which is now roughly $21,600 annual earnings for a single person. 
In 2018, after years of stalled legislative efforts to address the Medicaid gap, nearly 61% of Idaho voters approved a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid. 
Since then, support for expansion has risen, polling from 2023 shows.



 Idaho spent $92M this year in general funds on Medicaid expansion. The feds pitched in $1 billion.

In 2020, Idaho Medicaid expansion took effect, extending the health insurance public assistance program to more low-income workers for a population commonly called the working poor. Before expansion, they were in what advocates called the gap; they earned too much for Medicaid, and too little for subsidies to buy insurance on the state’s exchange.
Republican lawmakers often call Idaho’s Medicaid budget out of control, and they frequently point to the program’s full budget — not the state’s portion. Advocates have said Medicaid’s budget growth is stable.
Here’s a few snapshots of Idaho’s costs to expand Medicaid: 

States only pay 10% of costs of Medicaid expansion, with the federal government paying the other 90%. That’s much higher than Idaho’s usual share of Medicaid costs, which is more than 30% for other Medicaid populations such as people with disabilities and children. 
Overall, Idaho Medicaid expansion’s budget is appropriated about $1.34 billion this fiscal year, about twice as high as the program’s roughly $670 million budget in fiscal year 2021, the first full year that expansion was implemented. 
Medicaid expansion’s current budget in Idaho has the state paying $91.7 million in general funds this fiscal year, and the federal government paying more than $1 billion. 
Savings from expansion surpasses the state’s costs for the policy, the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy found in a report last year. In 2023, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare said repealing expansion would cost the state $78 million more. 
Expansion has also contributed $1.5 million to the state’s economy and generated almost $47 million in state taxes last year, a report by a University of Idaho economist found.

Speaking to reporters Friday, Idaho Gov. Brad Little cautioned against repealing Medicaid expansion, saying it’d spark unintended consequences. After expansion, he said the state took away some health care safety nets that were in place before — like the Catastrophic Health Care Fund, a state indigent health care program that gave financial assistance to people who were uninsured.

“If you look at Medicaid, there’s all kinds of unintended consequences,” Little said. “The raw number for repeal is not the actual number, and the Department of Health Welfare is working on that.”
When asked, Little stopped short of saying he would veto a bill to repeal Medicaid expansion. Instead, Little said he doesn’t say what he will do with bills before they arrive on his desk. 
Idaho Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, a Boise Democrat, called repealing expansion “probably one of the most expensive cuts we’ll make.”
And there’s also a health cost, doctors say.
“It just doesn’t make sense. It’s cruel and unusual punishment. And it’s not going to save the state money. It’s going to cost us money and lives in the long run,” said Dr. Kenneth Krell, a former ICU director in eastern Idaho.
An Idaho ‘reform’ bill would likely repeal voter-approved Medicaid expansion. Here’s why.

He advocated for Idaho Medicaid expansion after one of his patients died. He says her death was preventable. 
If the state repealed expansion, that would pile onto a range of cuts headed for Idaho Medicaid and health care: to doctor pay cuts, mental health cuts that could risk public safety, reforms from the state’s Medicaid law last year, federal cuts from the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” and expired federal health insurance subsidies.
Dr. Brian Birch, who leads the Treasure Valley’s Children’s Clinic in Meridian, said the state can’t handle more health care cuts. 
“There are pediatric practices that are on the brink of going out of business with the existing cuts,” Birch told the Sun in an interview. “… Ultimately, more cuts will lead to less access to care for everyone. Because if a (medical) practice closes down, they’re not just closing down to just Medicaid patients or Medicaid expansion patients — they’re closing down to everybody.”
 Ballot initiative to expand Medicaid didn’t come as surprise to some lawmakers, Republican senator says

Last year, a bill, pitched as a reform measure but which would’ve likely repealed expansion, narrowly passed the House. But Senate Health and Welfare Committee Chairwoman Julie VanOrden, a Republican from Pingree, halted the bill in her committee, preventing it from going to a full vote before the Senate.
Then she banded together with Republicans to back the big Medicaid bill that successfully became law. The bill, a comprehensive cost-cutting measure, proposed work requirements, shifting to privatized management of Medicaid benefits, and more policies that will take years to materialize. 
So far this year, she said she hasn’t seen a bill drafted to repeal expansion. She said she hasn’t supported a repeal because of all the ripple effects that could come.
“It’s just not repealing expansion and doing away with an expense that we have on our budget,” she told the Sun last week. “It’s not as plain and simple as that.”

She remembers the legislative debates leading up to the ballot initiative that expanded Medicaid. She was serving in the House in 2018, as the ballot initiative was gearing up. 
Legislative leadership was trying to find a way to address the gap, but they couldn’t reach an agreement on a bill, she said.
“So when Medicaid expansion became a citizens initiative and made it to the ballot and passed, it wasn’t surprising to some of us because we knew that there was a problem and it needed to be addressed. And the Legislature had failed to address it,” VanOrden said. “And so the citizens took it into their own hands.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Ahead of the 2026 legislative session, Iowa statewide elected officials have released proposals they hope lawmakers will address, including DNA testing for arrested individuals, increasing penalties for public employees and officials who steal public funds and combating business fraud.
Several offices, as well as state departments, have submitted legislative proposals leading up to the start of session, which begins Monday.
Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird held a news conference alongside former New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez and other Iowa public safety officials where she announced her office’s aim to pass a measure known as “Katie’s Law” in Iowa.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
This proposal, named after Katie Sepich, a 22-year-old University of New Mexico student who was killed in 2003, would require DNA be collected from criminal defendants after being arrested for a felony or aggravated misdemeanor charge — an expansion from current requirements that state DNA be collected only after a person is convicted.
Martinez said she supported the law as governor to allow criminals to be more quickly caught, pointing to Sepich’s murder as a reason for the need to collect this evidence. While law enforcement officers collected DNA evidence under her fingernails, as there was not a match in national databases for her murderer — Sepich’s killer was not arrested for more than three years after her death, after he submitted a DNA sample following his prison sentence for convictions of burglary, resisting arrest and fraudulent refusal to return leased property.
“Katie’s Law” will help bring criminals to justice quicker in cases like Sepich’s murder, Bird said.
“No family should have to wait years for answers about what happened to their loved one, and no criminal should ever get away with murder, rape or any other violent crime,” Bird said. “We need to give law enforcement the tools they need to investigate and to bring violent criminals to justice. Over 30 other states already have Katie’s Law — I think Iowa should too.”
Martinez, who signed an expansion to New Mexico’s law in 2011, said it has survived challenges up to the U.S. Supreme Court and is an important tool in closing cold cases.
“When we wait until conviction to collect the DNA, we give serial offenders a free pass between the time of their arrest and their final sentencing. We allow them to remain anonymous for periods of time and different crimes that they’ve already committed. Katie’s Law closes this window.”
Bird also proposed another measure she said will help victims of crimes in Iowa, which included provisions allowing victims of sex crimes to get lifetime no-contact orders, shortening the period of time required for sex offenders to notify local authorities of changes in their residence, work and vehicle and allowing crime victim counselors to share certain confidential information with law enforcement when there is a risk of immediate harm.
Bird said these changes are issues specifically brought up by crime victims and victim advocates as steps that could help prevent new traumatization and further crimes.
“We don’t take lightly the pain that victims endure, and we will take meaningful action and make sure that victims are safe and that their voices are heard,” Bird said.
Secretary of State’s office combats business fraud
Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate also has a proposal in 2026 to help Iowans facing a different type of crime — business fraud.
In an interview with Iowa Capital Dispatch, Pate said his top priority in the 2026 session will be passing a measure to help protect Iowa homeowners from certain business crimes in which person creating a fraudulent business chooses a random individual and home address as their “registered agent.”
“They just randomly pick you and put your address down, so you’re now the registered agent — and that means any creditors or legal action gets directed to you,” Pate said. “This is very disturbing, obviously, because first thing I’m going to think, is there’s nothing good coming out of this, this is not a legitimate company. And it’s been very difficult to always find these, and more difficult even to dissolve them, because it’s a very cumbersome process.”
Pate said he plans to propose an “expedited process” for marking the business as illegitimate, which he said would allow his office to dissolve the company and take care of related issues so that “the consumer or the homeowner is not getting put in a bad position.”
While there have been instances of these crimes being reported around Des Moines metro and in other parts of the state, Pate said it is difficult to find numbers on how often this type of fraud is occurring due to underreporting from affected homeowners as well as the rate at which these fraudulent businesses are created and dissolved.
He said the proposal will aim to address an oversight in Iowa’s current system for effectively identifying and addressing these crimes.
“The frustrating thing is … in Iowa, we don’t have a real clear line of who should be out there as a point person on these things,” Pate said. “The attorney general handles consumer fraud, but when you talk about the business side, it’s a bit of a gray area. And I am not looking at becoming the attorney general, but I want to make sure I can help shepherd and get the information to the attorney general, or to (the Department of Public Safety).”
Sand calls for repeal of auditor’s law, increased penalties for stealing public funds
Iowa Auditor Rob Sand said in a Monday news conference one of his biggest priorities for the 2026 session was to reverse a measure passed by the Legislature in 2023 that restricts his office from accessing certain documents and personal information, and that stops taking other state agencies to court.
Sand, the sole Democrat to hold statewide elected office in Iowa, has repeatedly criticized Senate File 478 as a “pro-corruption bill,” saying it prevents the state auditor’s office from being able to effectively audit state government institutions. In addition to limiting access to certain documents and personal information, the 2023 law directs disputes between the auditor’s office and state entities to a board of arbitration instead of to court. The panel made up of two members involved in the dispute — the auditor’s office and the entity being audited — in addition to a third member appointed by the governor’s office.
As Republicans hold a trifecta of control at the Iowa Capitol, Sand’s proposals face long odds of making it through the legislative process. However, he said he believes the measure would help provide better transparency and accountability to Iowa state government.
“Standing up here today is me doing the right thing — suggesting ideas that directly impact the state auditor’s office, not weighing whether or not the Legislature wants to pass them,” Sand said.
The auditor also introduced a measure proposing mandatory prison time for public employees and public officials convicted of stealing $10,000 or more of public funds. Sand said not allowing courts to defer or suspend a defendant’s prison sentence in these cases was a “common sense” measure, as it would ensure people who steal taxpayer funds face prison time.
Other statewide officials
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig has proposed the Iowa Farm Act, a measure rolling several ag-related measures into one bill, including tax relief, zoning for farm-related businesses, school purchasing of farm products and biosecurity.
State Treasurer Roby Smith has not publicly announced a legislative agenda.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraskans have participated as the state’s “second house” and voiced the “will of the voters” in 23 statewide ballot measures since 2004. 
More than 17.6 million votes were cast for or against those issues.
Voters have weighed in on statewide measures in every election since 2014, one of the longest stretches of voter-advocated ballot issues in state history. Advocates across the political spectrum say part of the reason for consistent petitions is failure to reflect voters’ wishes in the Legislature, the one-house, one-in-a-nation system designed by voters themselves under a 1934 constitutional amendment.
The Nebraska Constitution, since 1912, has allowed Nebraskans to create new state laws and constitutional amendments and repeal laws passed by the Legislature. Some 18 statewide ballot measures have passed including and since the 2004 election.
Signatures and campaign finance

There are strict signature-gathering requirements to reach the ballot, including bulk totals and a distribution requirement. Measures reaching voters over that span required more than 2 million signatures for an up-or-down vote. Tens of thousands more signatures were gathered for measures that fell short or were disqualified from being voted on.
Groups vying to reach voters spent $95 million over that period. Of that total, the 2022 and 2024 election cycles accounted for more than half.
The upward trend in fundraising and spending for ballot measures is similar to what’s facing legislative races, including the 25 seats up for election in 2024. Legislative elections exceeded $10 million in spending, a new record.
Of the legislative tally in 2024, $1 million came after freshman State Sens. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha and Tanya Storer of Whitman joined a new tactic in which candidates purchase campaign advertising for ballot measure campaigns more cheaply than the ballot campaigns could without them. University of Nebraska Regents Rob Schafer of Beatrice and Jim Scheer of Norfolk and John Yoakum, a member of the Lower Platte South Natural Resources District, also joined in as part of competing abortion-related ballot campaigns.
Nebraska’s 49 state senators are paid $12,000 a year.
Voter-lawmaker tension
Tension between voters and state officials escalated in 2025, with multiple bills and legislative debates around implementing or tweaking medical cannabis, paid sick leave, minimum wage, state support for private schools and more. The Constitution requires 33 votes from legislators to tweak voter-approved state laws.

As a result of the 2025 legislative session, a 2026 petition campaign seeks to make it harder for lawmakers to intervene and require 40 votes to do so.
Eight more petitions are circulating for the 2026 ballot — around abortion, property taxes and property valuations, teacher pay, recreational marijuana, hand-count ballots and how the state awards its Electoral College votes for president. Another, to legalize online sports betting, waits in the wings pending legislative action, or inaction.
Lawmakers in 2025 invoked phrases like the “will of the voters” and “will of the people” 499 times in 2025. Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, too, used the phrase while advocating to change how the state awards presidential electors during his 2025 State of the State address.
Embattled State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst, who faces a possible expulsion vote as soon as this week, has invoked the phrase in defense of his service.
Lawmakers define ‘will of the voters’
Starting in June 2025, the Nebraska Examiner invited all 49 state senators to reflect on what the phrase “will of the voters” means to them as they approach legislation proposing tweaks to voter-approved ballot measures. Lawmakers were also asked if they supported any specific changes and, if so, what.
As of publication, 33 senators had responded. A couple said they did not have time to respond or worried that, however they responded, it could be a “trick question.” View the project in a new online window here.
This is the first in a series of articles examining ballot measures and campaign finance that the Nebraska Examiner intends to publish in January 2026.

If we truly want to reestablish our national “greatness,” then we, and especially those who represent us in government, must all recommit to the fundamental and very simple proposition that America is, and has always been, a nation of laws, not men, write a group of Wyoming attorneys and retired judges.
The post The American way appeared first on WyoFile .","Since the events of Jan. 6, 2021 and its aftermath, we and many others in the legal profession have warned about the steady erosion of the Rule of Law and the breakdown of our constitutional order. Still, over the last year, the decline has accelerated and has now reached locomotive speed. 

Opinion

There is more than one cause for this, including partisan congressional gridlock, but it is clear the primal force behind the recent dramatic deterioration of our constitutional guardrails is the unprecedented assertions of executive power by President Trump and the accompanying unwillingness of our Congress to restrain him. 
The president’s unilateral decision to send a large U.S. military force into Venezuela last week, without seeking congressional approval, is just the latest example of his executive power overreach. Through the use of hundreds of executive orders, proclamations and executive memoranda often disingenuously justified with self-declared “emergencies,” the president has repeatedly evaded Congress to take unilateral executive action beyond what any other peacetime president has done before.
The chronic resort to unchecked executive action based on one man’s declared “emergency” should raise an enormous red flag to anyone who claims to support American constitutionalism. Indeed, only a few years ago, our own U.S. Rep. Harriett Hageman sought to curb President Biden’s far more modest use of emergency executive orders by co-sponsoring the “Restoration of Separation of Powers Act” in Congress. Quoting James Madison, her bill rightly affirmed that “[t]here can be no liberty where the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person.” Her bill thus proposed that every executive order be expressly supported by a presidential “statement of [its] specific statutory or constitutional authority” and that every “emergency” order would be short-lived, automatically terminating after 90 days absent congressional approval. 
But her bill did not pass. And now that President Trump is declaring the emergencies and signing the executive orders, her previous concern about runaway executive power has vanished. Both she and Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis have stood by mutely while the president, claiming one emergency after another, has wrecked congressionally approved programs and agencies, impounded or re-directed congressionally appropriated funds, circumvented congressional authority to impose crushing tariffs on our allies, deployed military forces into states against their wishes, imprisoned and deported thousands of individuals without due process, authorized the killing of over 100 foreign civilians via multi-million dollar missile strikes on unproved charges of “narco-terrorism,” and, to start the new year, shaken our entire hemisphere by directing our armed forces to invade a sovereign nation of 30 million people, seizing its head of state and killing 80 people in the process. 
These presidential orders are direct assaults on Congress’ constitutional authority to tax and spend, declare war and oversee the military — the fundamental powers over the “purse and the sword,” which our founders fought a long and bloody war to take from a king and instead place in the hands of “the people” through our elected Congress. 
Yet, in the face of these unprecedented presidential actions, our Congress has done nothing to protect its hard-won authority — authority bestowed upon it through the supreme sacrifices of our ancestors. Indeed, in a perversely ironic twist, many in Congress, including our own representatives, have howled in protest when federal judges, seeking to preserve congressional authority, have declared various executive orders unconstitutional. As we wrote previously, this shameful condemnation of our judiciary by members of our legislative branch has not only encouraged the president to further exploit his executive power, but it has also weakened the independence of both the judicial and legislative branches and enflamed threats of violence against judges and their families.
The president and his supporters say all of this is “great” because our nation has become weak and only radical actions by a “strong” leader can save us. Espousing these views, the president thus quotes Napoleon to proclaim, “he who saves his Country does not violate any Law.” But this ends-justify-the-means worldview is both morally bankrupt and utterly at odds with our founders’ deliberate design based upon shared powers between three branches of government — a design inherent in our national and state constitutions and the laws established by our representative legislatures. Over the last 250 years, millions of Americans have fought and died to preserve our unique form of republican democracy, a governmental structure that has made America the hope and envy of the free world. 
Yet the president and his followers now increasingly see our Constitution and laws as optional; they seek to discredit citizens like us who dare to challenge the authority for the president’s bold actions by calling us “elitist” or “radical woke leftists.” They say the world has changed and that our problems are now too big to solve through legalistic constitutional processes and “rules-based systems.” Tired of democracy, they cheer the president’s every action, including his ever-growing resort to force, whether through the expanded deployment of masked ICE brigades in blue American cities, or by bombing, blockading and threatening a growing number of sovereign countries. 
It should be impressed: The president took his recent actions regarding Venezuela without even consulting Congress, let alone seeking its permission. Worse, our own three congressional representatives did not even want to be informed. Barrasso and Lummis both voted against a recent resolution merely seeking to give the Senate the opportunity to debate and discuss whether the president’s military actions in Venezuela required congressional approval under the War Powers Act. Their vote against even engaging on the topic gave the president a blank check to launch last week’s invasion, and seemingly whatever other military action he may have in mind for Venezuela — or anywhere else.
This is not the American way. Americans have always vigorously debated the proper ends of government, but we decided 250 years ago that the means to accomplish those ends must always conform to our Constitution and laws. Americans teach our children “might does not make right,” rules matter and the ends do not justify the means. We have not always lived up to our lofty national standards, and those standards have evolved through costly trial and error. Even so, pursuing our public goals the “right way,” in accordance with established law, international treaties and recognized principles of justice, is foundational to our national identity. It is also at the heart of American moral and religious traditions, which have always asked: “For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?”
We’ve come to the 250th anniversary of our founding, and yet another important election year.  If we truly want to retain or reestablish our national “greatness,” then we, and especially those we choose to represent us in Congress and our state and local governments, must all profoundly recommit to the fundamental and very simple proposition that America is, and has always been, a nation of laws, not men. This is the American way. And it is the only means through which Americans can authentically pursue “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” consistent with our founding. Our parents and grandparents and so many more fought and died for this principle. We can no longer allow our priceless heritage as Americans to be sacrificed on the altar of those who shortsightedly value their personal ambitions or political party power over our Constitution, laws and moral code.
Please join us this special anniversary year to demand that every Wyoming political candidate and office holder protect and defend America’s constitutional values and democratic institutions from further debasement. Our children and grandchildren depend on it.

[…]","A family makes its way down rapids on the Illinois River near Watts, Oklahoma, on June 1, 2024. (Photo by dlewis33/Getty Images)One of the earliest lessons parents teach their children is if they break someone else’s things — even if it’s by accident — they have a responsibility to make it right.
This virtue transcends into adulthood in practical ways, such as carrying automobile insurance in case of a crash or paying restitution following a crime.
But a group of influential Oklahoma Republicans apparently believe this moral code applies to everyone except our state’s poultry industry. Because otherwise, they’d be celebrating a long-awaited decision mandating those big businesses to fix the damage they’ve caused to our waters while spreading too much phosphorus-rich chicken manure as fertilizer. The practice has damaged the ecosystem in eastern Oklahoma and neighboring Arkansas.
Over the past few weeks, it’s been embarrassing to watch these Republicans — including Gov. Kevin Stitt, House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, several gubernatorial hopefuls and a number of other elected lawmakers — publicly bow before their agricultural overlords and kiss their ring in a bid to gain favor.
Usually this obscene obsequiousness occurs behind closed doors, but apparently the Farm Bureau has grown so powerful that lawmakers are more fearful about being viewed as disloyal to this group than to their constituents.
The poultry industry, meanwhile, is panicking. 
They’ve been on notice now for at least two decades that their practice of spreading copious amounts of chicken poop across the Illinois River Watershed has been polluting the area that millions of people in two states rely on for drinking water and recreational purposes. The 100-mile Illinois River begins in the Ozarks in northwest Arkansas and runs through the mountains in eastern Oklahoma before dumping into Tenkiller Ferry Lake.
Former Democratic Attorney General Drew Edmondson first sued several large companies over 20 years ago to stop their contractors’ pollution and to press the companies to repair it. While there has been some movement to fix the issue, it’s been slow, and a judge has found it’s been insufficient to restore the contaminated ecosystem.
And the industry continues to spread poop. 
The case languished in court for decades, but now these bad environmental policies are coming home to roost thanks to a rare Republican leader: Attorney General Gentner Drummond, who refuses to let the industry get away with it.
Just before Christmas, federal Judge Gregory Frizzell, who was appointed by former Republican U.S. President George W. Bush, found several large poultry companies that have operated across the watershed responsible for polluting it. 
He ordered the companies to pay to fix it and to immediately put $10 million into a fund to begin. He also limited how much manure they can spread.
The companies, including Tyson, Cargill, George’s, Simmons, Cobb-Vantress, and Cal-Maine, have appealed.
In recent weeks, the debacle has revealed unsavory flavors of Oklahoma politics and the role that agriculture lobbyists still play in shaping our political outcomes, even as our state becomes increasingly urban and suburban.
At a Dec. 16 poultry industry rally backed by the Oklahoma Farm Bureau in Adair County, Republicans vied to be seen.
Speaker Hilbert told the crowd that the Oklahoma Legislature has proven to poultry producers that “we’re going to have your backs.” He said they’ve done that not just with words, but with actions. He celebrated a new law that limits the poultry industry’s liability.
What about having the backs of the rest of us who don’t have as much money or influence and that don’t work in agriculture?
Why aren’t our lawmakers passing legislation that makes sure that we all have clean water, unpolluted lands and stringent environmental protections? Why do the interests of a minority of agriculture producers outweigh everyone else’s?
Stitt, meanwhile, told the industry that he’s standing with them. Bizarrely, he’s convinced that this is an issue of trial attorneys trying to get rich.
He told the crowd that he fired his previous secretary of energy and environment because he refused to write Judge Frizzell a letter stating that Oklahoma is not “trying to go after your (poultry) industry” and instead attended a court hearing supporting the litigation.
One would think that it’s good that former secretary Ken McQueen chose to stand up for the average Joe.
“I fired him on the spot,” Stitt said to cheering and applause, adding that he appointed Jeff Starling to the post. 
Take note, Starling, who Stitt said also attended the rally, is running as a Republican for attorney general. I suspect we all know exactly what will happen to this lawsuit if Starling wins.
Stitt said he’s pushing for a “common sense settlement” that protects both the environment and food producers. He believes if spreading poultry waste is banned, nobody is going to want to grow chickens in Oklahoma.
The industry has had decades to sort this out and could have if they wanted. Clearly, they’re not willing to do so in a manner that best serves public interest. And we should not give away the farm to settle this, not when we have a group of lawmakers championing weak environmental protections that favor industry over people.
Maybe the better solution is for the industry to leave Oklahoma and spread their manure in another state if they won’t make things right. It’s not like we’re getting discounted eggs at the grocery store.
According to Stitt, former House Speaker Charles McCall was one of four 2026 Republican gubernatorial hopefuls that attended the rally. Chip Keating, Mike Mazzei and Jake Merrick were the others. Drummond, who is also running, did not attend.
McCall is particularly proud of his decision to champion Senate Bill 1424, which he said “protects growers from lawsuits when they follow environmental rules set by the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality.” 
What McCall omits is that the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality has the reputation of being an ankle-biting chihuahua, not an attack dog that passes regulations that clearly protect the public and environment.  If they did, we wouldn’t be here.
One can only hope our politicians won’t forget who actually elects them and who they’re supposed to be serving — people, not special interests.
But if this rally, candidate pool and pandering is any indication of what’s to come, don’t count on it.

Residents complain state board has inadequately addressed concerns. Then, Gov. Mark Gordon and Secretary of State Chuck Gray get into ugly spat.
The post Wyoming’s top officials promise to reckon with ever-increasing wind projects, other development appeared first on WyoFile .","For 2.5 hours Thursday, state officials heard testimony and emotional pleas from nearly two dozen residents throughout central and southeast Wyoming about a growing “wall” of wind turbines that critics say threatens to proliferate unchecked. 
The State Board of Land Commissioners, most speakers agreed, has fumbled its responsibility to effectively engage the public, has approved state land leases for various industrial projects that it sometimes regrets and generally failed to consider cumulative impacts critics say threaten private property, ranching and small communities.
“This is no longer a series of isolated projects,” Cheyenne area resident Wendy Volk said. “It is a continuous, or near continuous, industrial corridor stretching across multiple counties and landscapes.”
Niobrara County rancher Bobby Giesse was more direct.
“Why is it when 90% of the people are saying, ‘We don’t want this. [It threatens] things like the oil and gas industry. It’s against tourism. It is in direct conflict with agriculture.’ But yet it’s getting pushed down our throats and people aren’t listening. So the question is, why?”
The board, made of Wyoming’s top five elected officials, held the special meeting in Douglas — one of the hotbeds of existing and planned large energy projects, including the controversial Pronghorn H2 wind and hydrogen energy proposal. Board members empathized with residents’ frustrations.

“One of the complaints I’ve heard about this decision is that we aren’t willing to admit we made a mistake,” Auditor Kristi Racines said, referring to the board’s decision last year to grant state land leases to the Pronghorn H2 developer. “And so me, personally, I am here today to tell you that I apologize. I apologize for the mess that this has become.”
The board has sometimes whiffed on public notices, Racines added, and failed to give the public a proper platform to engage, including a December meeting that didn’t allow for a full discussion between the board and concerned residents. “I was horrified by the way that came out,” Racines said. “It was very unsatisfying to everyone there.”
Though wind energy stood at the center of the discussion, residents and local officials alike referenced myriad new energy projects, as well as what appears to be a wave of data center proposals. Combined, the tsunami of industrial ventures threatens viewsheds, tourism, agriculture and scarce water resources without a cohesive government venue to deal with either specific projects or bigger picture impacts.
“My request today is very simple,” Cheyenne area resident Niffy McNiff Bube told the board. “Please slow down, take a broader view and fully consider cumulative impacts when evaluating, when leasing on state-trust lands, especially in the areas where development is forming continuous corridors.”

Though public testimony was emotional at times, the decorum of the hearing went smoothly — until a spat erupted between board members Gov. Mark Gordon and Secretary of State Chuck Gray. The two have frequently sparred in public forums.
While hashing out procedural matters at the end of the hearing, Gordon accused Gray of casting aspersions against Attorney General Keith Kautz, who was not at the meeting. Gray denied doing so, and things quickly escalated.
“Step outside,” Gordon said to Gray. “Do you want to step outside?”
“Are you threatening me?” Gray responded while seated next to the governor.
“No, I’m asking if you want to step outside?” Gordon said.
“Are you threatening me?” Gray said again.
The bickering de-escalated from there, with Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder commenting, “This has been very unproductive the last couple of minutes. I’d like to get us back on track.”
Asked for an explanation regarding the governor’s remarks, Gordon Communications Director Amy Edmonds told WyoFile, “The governor just wanted to sort of cleanse the palate. Step outside, have a conversation. And really, it was asking the secretary, ‘Do you need to go outside?'”
State board’s role
The Office of State Lands and Investments, which includes the State Board of Land Commissioners, has come under increasing public pressure for its outsized role in determining the viability of energy and mining projects.
“Please slow down, take a broader view and fully consider cumulative impacts when evaluating, when leasing on state-trust lands, especially in the areas where development is forming continuous corridors.”Niffy McNiff Bube
The agency administers more than 3 million acres of school trust lands scattered throughout every county in the state. Because of that scattered pattern, energy and mining projects — if their footprint is large enough — commonly include state-owned lands, or “school sections.” If a developer acquires a state land lease, it makes their project seem much more viable to investors and other permitting agencies, several concerned residents asserted.
Some argued Thursday that developers even seek out state land leases as a fulcrum to gain leverage over neighboring landowners.
There can also be an inherent conflict between the agency’s fiduciary duty to utilize state school sections to maximize revenue for K-12 schools via mining and oil development and other, less lucrative uses, such as recreation and grazing. Sometimes priorities differ between the state and a county’s land use plan. A recent example is the dispute over a proposed gravel mining operation at the base of Casper Mountain — an ongoing episode that began with the board of commissioners approving mining leases without reviewing the applications or consulting with locals.
Responding to a rancher’s criticism of a singular focus on maximizing revenues from school sections, Treasurer Curt Meier offered empathy, but no apologies.
“I’m going to continue to live up to my constitutional duties” as a state board of land commissioner, Meier said. “I can’t do anything less. I understand the situation that you guys are in. You’re impacted.”
Still, residents said they feel like the state is failing them.

“Our regulatory framework, designed decades ago, was not intended to address development at this scale or concentration,” Volk said. “Evaluating projects one-by-one while ignoring what surrounds them creates blind spots large enough to affect entire landscapes, surface lessees and communities. Wyoming deserves better than a piecemeal process for decisions of this magnitude.”
More recently, the board has been in hot water with residents living between Glenrock and Douglas, who are frustrated that Colorado-based Focus Clean Energy, the Pronghorn H2 developer, received leases despite widespread opposition. A rancher challenged the state leases — spanning some 15,500 acres in total — in district court and won, resulting in an order to repeal the leases.
Gordon earned the ire of Secretary Gray — who voted against granting the leases — when Attorney General Kautz appealed the decision to the Wyoming Supreme Court. Gordon and Kautz have said the primary reason for the appeal was that the lower court’s ruling appears to redefine leasing language in a way that might open the state to much broader challenges.

Gordon also surmised on Thursday that other board members might want the attorney general to withdraw his appeal to the state’s high court and voluntarily rescind the Pronghorn H2 state leases. In response to a motion by Gray to do just that, Gordon noted that the board had not provided public notice for such actions and declared the motion “out of order.”
Potential solutions
Several board members appeared to concede that the agency’s narrow focus, combined with a bureaucracy of siloed institutions at the local, state and federal levels, has proven inadequate to meet the challenge of orchestrating development guided by cultural and land values.
Gordon, during the meeting, likened such deficiencies to criticism during the coalbed methane gas boom of the 2000s. He issued a statement after the meeting, noting “Wyoming has spent decades finding the ‘sweet spot’ — from the coalbed methane fields to today’s discussion on wind. 
“The broad takeaway is these are issues Wyoming has been struggling with for decades and those of us who are constitutionally entrusted with the responsibility of these lands by the people have grappled with similar issues over time,” he continued. “Getting to the perfect solution for everyone may not be possible but it’s clear everyone is working toward getting as close to that outcome as possible.” 
One potential tool, Gordon suggested during the meeting, is to “repurpose” the rare or very uncommon provision in the Wyoming Environmental Quality Act — a tool that has been mostly neutered by the Legislature, he said.
“It allowed for a nomination to be done that could set aside portions of state land,” Gordon said while addressing Glenrock Republican Rep. Kevin Campbell. “I have been trying for at least four years to repurpose that provision so that citizens like these could say, ‘This is a very special part of Wyoming. This needs to be protected,’ which would then give this board more of an opportunity to say, ‘Here’s a reason why we shouldn’t be talking about fiduciary'” duties alone.
Campbell accepted an invitation from Gordon to take up such a measure in the Legislature.
Meantime, concerned residents pressed for a broader solution and perspective.
“I would like to emphasize that asking for cumulative corridor level review is not opposition to wind energy,” Volk told the board. “It is a request for responsible asset management. Wyoming’s trust lands are finite. Once they’re fragmented and industrialized at this scale, the loss of flexibility, productivity and landscape integrity cannot be undone.”

Rep. Bill Allemand's arrest for drunk driving calls voters' tolerance for transgression into question. We should consider deeply who we decide to trust with the routing numbers to the people’s bank account, writes guest columnist Susan Stubson.
The post With power over the people’s purse strings should come higher standards appeared first on WyoFile .","My friend Millie and I are running buddies. She’s smart, educated and thoughtful. She is also single and would love to have a companion to hang out with, settle down and raise a family. For now, our runs are populated with horror stories of creeps, cads and crazies that come across her radar. To her credit, she refuses to lower the bar and is committed to her search for the right one who can live up to her standards. That is yet to happen. We keep running.

Opinion

I wish our electorate would be as discerning as Millie when it comes to those we elect to hold the keys to our kingdom.
When Rep. Bill Allemand, R-Casper, was arrested last month and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, I scratched another tally mark in my ballooning list of “ways our leaders have failed us” chart.
It is not the arrest that raises concern. I’ll leave it up to Allemand to preserve his sterling reputation and contest the whys and ways, which landed him in the slammer. Allemand has not been convicted and rightly deserves his day in court to defend the allegations. To those of you who are busy dismantling the Rule of Law, remember you’ll hate it until you need it. In the meantime, let us bow our knee and thank the high holy Constitution, we are innocent until proven guilty. 
It is what followed, Allemand’s pitiful response to the allegations, which bothers me. Allemand could have taken the high road and issued a public statement, rife with sincerity and remorse, asking his constituents for grace as he looks forward to his day in court and an opportunity to address the allegations.
Rather, he took to the swampy trenches and refused to accept responsibility for his actions. Taking a page from the MAGA playlist, he turned the lens outward, attacking the arresting officer, who may have been unaware of the Big Deal he just pulled over, and who potentially saved lives in the process. 
Allemand argued his arrest was the result of his constitutional exercise of free speech and accused law enforcement of refusing to let him exercise his civil rights. I would have loved to have been a chaff of wheat on that county road to hear the maybe not-so lucid lawmaker expound on the virtues of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Dodge, divert, deflect. Repeat. Throw in a conspiracy theory or two and you have a premium toolbox for redirecting attention away from those responsible to any unsuspecting pawn within striking distance. 
Public servants and constituents are both human, imperfect, and capable of mistakes and lapses in judgment. Who among us has not fallen short? Would it have hurt him to appeal to our good graces? Consider how an acknowledgment of poor behavior and a promise to do better would have landed with his electorate. Could it have been any worse than publicly attacking another public servant who is in the business of protecting us from ourselves? 
Legislating is serious business and we expect serious lawmakers. Allemand is a member of the Joint Appropriations Committee. Membership on the JAC is a lofty perch, highly coveted, typically secured after years of listening, studying, and understanding the complexities of government, its agencies and revenue streams. This is the committee where the seasoned dogs are, the best and brightest, those with a wonky, nerdy knowledge of the state’s budget who sit on the committee only after doing their time of slow-grind legislating. 
Allemand has been in office since 2023. His legislative profile is silent as to his occupation, ditto for his education and professional background. There is no showing of civic organizations with which he is involved. He is part of a ranching operation listed as inactive on the Secretary of State’s website. He runs, by his own account, an unnamed trucking company. He is a stranger to the business community, which props up our economy. His skill and expertise in representing his constituents is unclear. In this curious void, it is fair to judge Allemand by the content of his character. 
His fury and sputter, blaming everyone but himself, is a tell he cannot avoid. Is this a lawmaker we should trust with the routing numbers to the people’s bank account, which holds an estimated total investment of $33 billion?
This isn’t an Allemand problem, this is an us problem. Why do we settle for unexceptional folks, with undefined day jobs who hover on the banks of a civil society, to represent our interests? Is this the best we can do?
Wyoming’s long street runs both ways. By entering the public forum, legislators willingly submit themselves to the public microscope. In return, we too should honor and respect the office and model civility while at the same time holding them to a higher level of scrutiny. Rather than attack a wayward politician, pay attention and vote the bums out when they fail to live up to the task for which we elected them. 
Know thyself, Rep. Allemand. There is honor in stepping down, releasing your seat to someone better suited, better equipped for the noble yet arduous task of managing a state. 
Resign, Rep. Allemand. Do the right thing. Make America Honorable Again.

Wisconsin State Capitol on a snowy day. (Baylor Spears | Wisconsin Examiner)After WisconsinEye, the state’s version of C-Span, went off the air in December, Republican lawmakers rediscovered rules that bar members of the public from making video and audio recordings of committee hearings and decided to start enforcing them.
Wisconsin lawmakers, journalists and members of the public returned to the Capitol last week for a packed slate of committee hearings and executive sessions but for the first time in nearly 20 years, WisconsinEye was not broadcasting daily legislative proceedings.
A notice passed around Assembly committees listed two rules. Assembly rule 11, related to committee procedures, states that “insofar as applicable, the rules of the Assembly apply to the procedures of standing committees and special committees.”
Assembly rule 26, which relates to members of the public observing from visitor galleries in the Assembly chambers, states that they “may not use any audio or video device to record, photograph, film, videotape, or in any way depict the proceedings on or about the Assembly floor.” 
Senate rule 11 also states that “no persons other than members of the chief clerk’s staff, members of the staff of the sergeant at arms, members of a senator’s staff, and accredited correspondents of the news media may engage in any audio or video recording of the proceedings of the Senate or any committee without permission of the committee on Senate organization.” According to the Senate Chief Clerk Cyrus Anderson, the rule was first adopted in 2005. 
Wisconsin’s open meetings law expressly states that governmental bodies “shall make a reasonable effort to accommodate any person desiring to record, film or photograph the meeting,” but the law includes a provision that says that “no provision of this subchapter which conflicts with a rule of the senate or assembly or joint rule of the legislature shall apply to a meeting conducted in compliance with such rule.”
Rep. Jerry O’Connor (R-Fond Du Lac) told the Wisconsin Examiner that the rules were reviewed in caucus at the start of the year.
“Many of [the members], like me, I didn’t know there was a rule,” O’Connor said. “So it was a reminder.” 
Rep. David Steffen (R-Howard), who has served in the Assembly since 2015, said he couldn’t remember looking at the rule in the last decade. 
“How many times have I just kind of breezed past it? I guess I never really thought of it, primarily because I’ve always had WisconsinEye to rely on to assist with that coverage, as well as present media and in-person public,” Steffen said. 
Steffen said lawmakers, seeking to understand their options in the absences of WisconsinEye, looked over the Assembly rules.
“One of the things that immediately became apparent is that under our Assembly rules, we already have some things that are readily available — for example, credentialed media — but we also have things that have always been prohibited,” Steffen said. “It remains the rule of the day, so this isn’t a new rule… In terms of the enforcement, I think it’s more of an awareness campaign than anything.”
The rule enforcement caused some confusion throughout last week.
Notices related to the rules were passed around and posted outside committee rooms. Committee chairs issued directions at the start of meetings. Reporters in committees were asked to show their credentials as they set up cameras and stood to take photos, and others, including staff members and members of the public without credentials, were stopped from doing so.
Rep. Clinton Anderson (D-Beloit), seeking to help fill the gap left by the absence of WisconsinEye, livestreamed on Facebook the meeting of the Assembly Local Government Committee on Wednesday, writing that “we have to step up and do what we can.” Anderson said on Thursday that he sought to do the same in the Assembly Agriculture Committee but was stopped from doing so as Rep. Travis Tranel (R-Cuba City) reminded the room of the rules related to recording.
“We’re now hearing that this will become standard practice across committees. If that’s the direction Republican leadership is heading, it represents a clear move to restrict public access,” Anderson said in a statement. “After WisconsinEye went dark, the response should have been to expand transparency, not quietly close another door on the public. I am disappointed to see the Assembly GOP go after the public’s First Amendment rights.”
Testimony from two Republican lawmakers on a bill to exempt overtime from income taxes was interrupted during an Assembly Ways and Means committee meeting on Thursday afternoon by  a point of order relating to video recording.
“I don’t have a problem, video all you want,” said Rep. Mike Bare (D-Verona), the committee’s ranking member, to someone who was holding up a cellphone “You’ve got nothing to hide. These guys have nothing to hide, but if we’re going to have a rule…”
“I know that there was staff taking a photo, yes, and I gotta challenge that if you’re videoing… if you’re doing a video that you’re not allowed in the committee area,” O’Connor said. 
O’Connor told the Examiner after the meeting that he is fine with photos being taken in his committee and he believes committee chairs can use their discretion on whether to allow photos. He said video is different because of  its potential use for political purposes.
“If it’s staff taking photos of their rep, I don’t have a big problem of it,” O’Connor said. “You could have somebody, an outsider, come and testify, and their best friend is sitting in this seat and wants to take a picture, that’s not the issue.”
“Trying to capture video, quite frankly, it gets down to it can be used politically,” he added. “So WisconsinEye tapes this, you cannot use a WisconsinEye clip in political campaigns. That’s why the rules originated, and I get that… I don’t want either side to violate that or benefit from it adversely.”
Bare said he wanted to ensure that the rules were being applied evenly if they were going to be enforced. 
“We have a long, rich tradition in Wisconsin of open government, open access to government, and we shouldn’t have be limiting that access to members of the public to staff to members and to the media in any way,” Bare said, adding that the enforcement of the rules is “clearly a response to WisconsinEye being offline, being dark, which seems like a preventable problem.”
“There’s plenty of states in the country who provide funding for broadcasting… We shouldn’t be in the situation where we members or our staff have to livestream onto social media,” Bare said. “We’ve got decades now of precedent of these things being broadcast out to the public.”
WisconsinEye halted its coverage in December due to a lack of funding after failing to raise sufficient funds to meet a matching requirement for the release of $10 million in state funds.  WisconsinEye leadership has been in discussions with lawmakers about a potential solution, including releasing part of the  $10 million that is intended to build an endowment.
“We’re only going to be in session for maybe eight to 10 more weeks, and if we’re unable to get WisconsinEye back up and running in that timeframe, I’m hopeful the public isn’t going to be impacted any more than they already have been,” Steffen said. 
Bill Lueders, president of the Wisconsin Freedom of Information Council, told the Examiner that the enforcement of the rule is a bad idea.
“Regardless of the law, denying the public the ability to record and film legislative meetings, especially in the absence of a functioning WisconsinEye, is deeply undemocratic and, in my opinion, foolhardy. Nothing that goes on in these meetings is anywhere near as insidious as what people will assume is happening if the ability to film and record it is being curtailed,” Lueders said.
Lueders said the Wisconsin Freedom of Information Council (WFIC) doesn’t support anything that treats the media differently from ordinary citizens.
“Although they may legally be able to pass their own rule and enforce their own rule to deny people an opportunity, it doesn’t make it any less of a good idea,” Lueders said.  
Steffen said he would be open to having options for the public to record and photograph meetings as long as they are not obstructing the activity of a committee. “I think that this situation, this hopefully short-term downtime, has created an opportunity to discuss some of those rules that have been on the books for some time, and perhaps there’s some that need to be modified.”
In the meantime, Steffen said lawmakers are focused on finding a solution to make up for the loss of  WisconsinEye and options for the public are limited to attending in person and consuming coverage by journalists in the Capitol.
Steffen called on local reporters to “fill the gap” in a press release on Friday.
“All of them have the ability to record, maybe sometimes just audio, but they all have the ability to record a proceeding and put that on their website,” Steffen said. “That at least would provide some opportunity for transparency during this interim.”
Lueders said local media “absolutely does not have the resources to film as many legislative hearings and sessions as WisconsinEye was doing; it just doesn’t have that capacity. Cameras can come and show up for part of a hearing, but they’re not there filming entire meetings on a daily basis, and that’s not a function that can be replicated… It’s more important than ever that ordinary citizens who attend these meetings are able to film and record it.”

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)The political deliberations and deal-making within the marbled halls of the Idaho Capitol may seem far removed from everyday life, but the decisions made during the frenzied three-ish-month annual legislative session have real lasting impacts on Idahoans. 
Roads, schools, taxes, health care access, grocery assistance, libraries, and youth sports teams are all things that may be affected by state elected leaders. 
For those with perhaps a hazy memory of watching Schoolhouse Rock’s I’m Just a Bill, it may be intimidating to jump in to follow or get involved. But as the people who reside in the Gem State, the lawmakers are there to represent you. And, as Thomas Jefferson once said, “Whenever the people are well-informed, they can be trusted with their own government.”
For those new to the process, the following is designed to be a comprehensive guide to the Idaho Legislature. 
 How does a bill become law? 

On a basic level, the legislative process is pretty similar from state to state, and even at the federal level. However, Idaho has a unique introduction process for legislation. 
To help visualize a bill becoming law, Boise State Public Radio has this informative flow chart. 
What does it mean for a bill to be ‘introduced’? 
Lawmakers bring draft legislation, called a “routing slip,” or RS, to committees that will vote on whether to “print” the draft bill. If it’s printed, it officially becomes a bill with a bill number. 
After a bill is “printed” or “introduced” — these terms are used interchangeably — it’s eligible to come up later for a public hearing, during which people may testify in favor or against it.

If the term “RS,” is unfamiliar, you’re not alone. Idaho’s bill introduction process is unique among state legislatures, according to Jaclyn Kettler, a political science associate professor at Boise State University who researches state legislatures and teaches comparative state politics.  
“We actually have this additional stage, in some ways, that provides a little bit of extra gatekeeping,” Kettler said. “Which can be positive or negative.” 
She said lawmakers who want to be able to introduce more bills may find it frustrating if they can’t get a vote to print their bill, but the process also may weed out unpopular bills early on. 
She said Idaho has a higher bill passage rate than many states, even among other legislatures with large majorities of one party. 
“A lot of the items that are not going to have a chance of getting passed, don’t even get fully introduced as a bill,” she said. 
Some states constrain legislating by putting limits on how many bills individual lawmakers may introduce, Kettler said. Idaho does not have any limits, and the number of bills prepared has trended upward since 2020, according to the 2025 final progress report from the Legislative Services Office. 
In 2020, there were 830 pieces of proposed legislation prepared, and 559 bills introduced. In 2025, there were 1,036 draft bills prepared, and 708 bills introduced. 
An entire list of bills introduced during the session can be found online here on the Legislature’s website. Past bills may be viewed by selecting a different year on the legislative session dropdown menu. 
If a bill was introduced in a Senate committee, it will go to the Senate floor for “first reading,” which is exactly what it sounds like. If it was in a House committee, it goes to the House floor. 
Bills in first reading are read by the clerks; usually it’s just the bill number and title read, unless a member requests that the text be read in full, which does happen – but rarely – as it is time-consuming. Once read and assigned a bill number, the chamber leader, either the House speaker or lieutenant governor in the Senate, sends the bill to a committee where it may come up for a hearing.

 What is the role of the committees and committee chairs? 

Before a bill may be debated by lawmakers on the floors of the House and Senate, it must advance out of committees, which are made up of a subset of lawmakers. 
The House has 14 “standing committees,” which meet regularly each session, as well as an Appropriations Committee, which meets jointly with the Senate Finance Committee. 
These standing committees include Agricultural Affairs, Business, Education, Health and Welfare, Revenue and Taxation, and Judiciary, Rules and Administration. 
The Senate has nine standing committees as well as its Finance Committee. 
House and Senate members meet together in the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, which writes budget bills for every state agency.
Typically, bills are considered in committees with a subject focus that most aligns with the content of the bill. However, legislative leaders have relatively broad discretion to decide which committee the bill goes through.   
When lawmakers or members of the public are upset that a bill goes through a committee with members perceived as friendlier to the bill, they may accuse legislative leaders and bill sponsors of “committee shopping.” 
During the 2024 election, Lewiston Republican Rep. Lori McCann told Idaho Education News that she thought leadership shopped around “school choice” bills that would allow state funds to go toward private K-12 tuition, after proposals failed to advance out of the House Education Committee and a school choice tax credit bill went to the House Revenue and Taxation Committee. 
Not every bill introduced gets a hearing. 
Idaho’s state government is somewhat unique in the amount of power committees have, said Kettler, the political science associate professor at Boise State University. Committee chairs have the authority to set meeting agendas and determine how the meetings will run. 
For example, some committee chairs will not allow remote testimony by video, but most will. 
During the 2023 session, two committee chairs prohibited testimony from those under the age of 18. House Judiciary and Rules Committee Chairman Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa, ended up changing the policy to allow testimony from minors under 18 if they had parental permission after a flood of concern about the policy, the Idaho Capital Sun reported.  
“Idaho is definitely one of those states with a strong committee chair and a powerful role for the committee,” Kettler said. “There are some state legislatures that require all bills to get a vote in committee, for example. That creates a very different dynamic compared to states like Idaho, where the committee chair has a lot more influence over what there’s going to be activity on.” 
Once a bill does come up for a public hearing, it will be posted on the committee agenda online and outside the committee room door on the bottom floor of the Idaho Capitol building. 
Most committee chairs limit testimony to two-to-three minutes. People may also email committee members with their thoughts on bills, and Idahoans can find contact information for legislators online. After the public testimony portion of the meeting ends, members take a vote. 
A committee member must make a motion on what to do with the bill before them, and that motion requires the majority vote of members to pass. There are a few options: 

Vote to send the bill to the full chamber for debate and vote, with a recommendation that it “do pass,” which moves the bill forward in the process. 
Hold the bill in committee, which is typically the death of the bill. 

Sometimes, members will ask to temporarily hold the bill for a vote on a later date if they want more time for deliberation.  


Send the bill to the full chamber for amendments. This is a special order of business during the House and Senate floor sessions, during which any member of the chamber may propose amendments to the bill, and the amendments are separately voted on by the whole body. 

In the House, this is called “General Orders” 
In the Senate this is called the 14th order. 
If amendments are proposed that are not approved by the primary bill sponsor, they are often called “hostile amendments.” 


Send the bill to the floor for a vote with “no recommendation.” Lawmakers don’t often use this option but will sometimes make a motion to do this if they are unsure if they approve of the bill but feel the issue warrants further debate by the entire chamber. 
According to the Idaho Legislature’s website, committees could also vote to send the bill to the full chamber for a vote but with a recommendation that it “do not pass.” This is seldom used. 

Once the bill goes to the floor, it will be put on the “second reading calendar.” Like the first reading, it will simply be read by name and title, which then makes it eligible for the “third reading.”

Bills on the third reading calendar are ones that are most likely to come up for a floor debate and vote. However, lawmakers frequently tinker with this list, asking for ones that aren’t ready for a vote to be held and bringing others that are ready up for a vote before they get to the top of the list. 
A House bill that went through a House committee and gets debated and voted on by the entire House, will, if approved, go through the same committee process in the Senate. 
If someone was interested in testifying on a bill and missed the first public hearing, they could get another chance when it comes up again on the other side of the Capitol rotunda.

 How do I get involved with a bill? What’s Idaho’s public hearing process like? 

If Idaho residents find there’s a topic or certain bill that affects them or involves a topic they care about, there are a few ways they can get involved with the legislative process. 
If a bill of interest has been introduced and assigned to a committee, it could come up at any time for a public hearing. Although nearly every other government entity in Idaho is bound to the Open Meetings Law, the Legislature is exempt from many of its requirements. This means there is no minimum time for notice required for hearings. Idaho is one of 21 states that exempts its legislature from open meetings laws, according to a 2020 analysis by professors from Notre Dame and The University of Virginia. 
All agendas can be found on the Legislature’s website legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/agenda by selecting Senate Committee Agendas, House Committee Agendas, or Joint Legislative Committees. Sometimes there is very little time between when the agenda is posted and when the hearing is scheduled to begin. 
“For me, as a lobbyist, that’s one of the last things I do before bed, is check the agendas,” said Randy Johnson, government relations director for the advocacy arm of the American Cancer Society, called the Cancer Action Network. “The hard part, though, is for community involvement … what I fear and what I dread are those, the night before I see it posted at 8 p.m. and the hearing is at 8 a.m.”

Johnson said the quick turnaround can be difficult to give enough notice for volunteers interested in testifying to be able to show up. 
The conservative think tank Mountain States Policy Center has advocated for the Idaho Legislature to require three-day notice for public hearings. Policy Center Vice President and Director of Research Jason Mercier in a commentary column for the Idaho Capital Sun noted that some of Idaho’s neighbors have minimum notice requirements — Washington largely requires five days, Montana has a three-day notice requirement, and Wyoming has a one-day minimum notice requirement.  
The speed at which a bill can go through the process sometimes may pick up toward the end of session, which is usually toward the end of March or early April. 
At the end of the 2025 session, lawmakers introduced a bill to allow the sale of over-the-counter ivermectin, had two public hearings, held a House and Senate debate and votes, and sent the bill to the governor for signature all in one day. To expedite the process, lawmakers have to waive some of their own rules. 
Despite some of the challenges, Idahoans regularly weigh in on legislation that they care about. This can be done by emailing their districts’ lawmakers, testifying at a hearing, or getting involved with an advocacy organization that’s working on the issue. 
 I’m ready to get involved, now what? 

Here are some ways to make your voice heard: 
To sign up to testify for a specific committee, navigate to that committee’s webpage, and click on the “testimony registration (remote and in person)” tab at the top.

To watch a hearing, viewers may access the live stream from Idaho Public Television’s In Session website, and navigate to the room where the meeting is happening. Or viewers can clink the link at the top of committee agendas online. 
To find out the legislators who represent your district, and to find their contact information, go to the Legislative Services Office’s website and put in your home address and ZIP code. Once you’ve entered that information, the three legislators – two House members and one senator – who represent your district will appear, and you can click on their headshots to find their email address and phone number.

Johnson, from the American Cancer Society advocacy group, and Boise State political science associate professor Jaclyn Kettler recommended that people try and find advocacy groups that focus on their area of interest.

If it’s health care, maybe the ACS Cancer Action Network, or Idaho Voices for Children.  Lobbyists with the Idaho Association of Commerce and Industry, or IACI, follow numerous business-related bills each session. 
The Idaho Republican Party and the Idaho Democratic Party follow many bills during the session and provide some updates and information to email subscribers. 
There are many other lobbying, industry or other special interest groups in Idaho who will notify members or subscribers when there’s movement on a bill of interest.

Lobbyists and special interest groups are frequent fliers in Idaho Capitol meeting rooms, but as lawmakers set policies that affect Idahoans’ everyday lives, Johnson said, it’s most important that they hear from those Idahoans. 
“I’ve talked to a lot of these lawmakers already. They know who I am,” Johnson said. “They already know about my talking point, I’m not going to convince them, for the most part, already going into those meetings, we know a lot.” 
“What we depend on to change those minds are people within their own districts. And that’s when having those storytellers, having that flood of people calling in, showing up, saying, ‘I want to testify to this,’ ‘this is so important to me and the community.”

 How is the state budget set? 

As a part-time Legislature, Idaho’s lawmakers convene for a roughly three-month session each year. Lawmakers’ sole constitutionally required task for the session is to approve a balanced budget, but this isn’t always a straightforward task. 
The state budget does more than keep the lights on, it determines public school funding, road and bridge maintenance projects, water infrastructure, university funding, public assistance programs, state parks maintenance, wildfire suppression, and so much more. 
 Step 1: Pick a revenue number 

To ensure the budget is “balanced,” budget-writers must determine how much revenue the state expects so that expenditures don’t exceed that number. Without the ability to peer into the future and see what happens, this revenue number amounts to an educated guess. 
The state fiscal year runs July 1 to June 30, so lawmakers in January must estimate how revenue will finish out the current fiscal year and the next fiscal year. 
There are a number of factors that can contribute to revenues coming in above or below projections, such as elevated or stalling sales tax revenue depending on people’s spending habits during the year. 
Income tax revenue may vary depending on worker and business earnings, and this number shifts depending on changes to the tax rate the Legislature enacts. The federal government can provide boosted or diminished funds for programs, depending on policy decisions made by Congress or the president, such as tariffs and federal tax code changes. Other economic factors can impact this number as well.
The Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee is a group of state House representatives and senators who are provided with a variety of  reports and projections from economists, university scholars, industry representatives, state budget staffers and others to recommend a feasible state revenue projection. 
After hearing the estimates and factors laid out by all these groups, the committee must vote on the number members believe will get the closest to reality. 
In 2025, committee members and presenters came up with fiscal year 2026 revenue projections that spanned from $5.5 billion from the Idaho Tax Commission up to an estimated $6.5 billion from House Majority Leader Rep. Jason Monks, R-Meridian. The governor’s budget staff predicted around $6.4 billion, while the mean of the committee members’ estimates came to $6 billion.
“Generally in forecasting, that’s how it goes. You see more variability if the projection’s farther away because there’s more things that can happen to change that projection,” Legislative Services Office budget staffer Hayley Kaae-Domgaard told committee members at their Jan. 9, 2025, meeting. 
Discussion at that meeting included a desire to have enough revenue to accomplish policy goals, such as an income tax cut, which the Legislature did. That year the state approved a $253 million income tax cut, the largest in state history.

Sen. Scott Grow, R-Eagle, who also chairs the state budget-writing committee, at the time expressed some concerns about the then-threat of tariffs, as Idaho is a strong trading partner with Canada, and the looming uncertainty of when the next recession would occur. 
One member expressed annoyance at the common practice of purposely estimating a low revenue to constrain spending and keep a higher number on the bottom line. Eagle Republican and House Assistant Majority Leader Josh Tanner argued that this results in agencies having to come back the next legislative session and ask for supplementals — a mid-fiscal-year budget request to cover costs incurred that could not be covered by what the agency was appropriated for that fiscal year. 
While the individual factors vary year to year, these are the types of considerations lawmakers must contend with each year to pick a revenue number. 
During that 2025 session, the revenue projection was just narrowly agreed on in a 10-8 vote by the committee. 
Is that the end of it, now the budget-writers can start setting budgets? 
Nope. 
The Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee can only make a recommendation. It’s up to the members of the powerful state budget writing committee, the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, called JFAC, to choose a number to work from. 
Historically, the budget-writers on JFAC have voted on and approved revenue projections early in the legislative session. But, because it’s politics, sometimes the politicking delays this process. 
In 2025, after failing to garner majority support for 59 days into the legislative session, JFAC adopted a revenue projection on March 5. By then, lawmakers had already approved the $253 million income tax cut. 
With all that deliberating, the projection must be pretty accurate, correct? Not always. 
As of December, Idaho’s state budget was projected to end the fiscal year on June 30 with a $40.3 million deficit. That estimated deficit shrunk from the previous months’ projection of $58.3 million more in expenditures than revenues. 
In 2022, amid an influx of federal COVID-19 pandemic assistance, Idaho boasted a record budget surplus of $1.5 billion.

 Step 2: Agency requests

Idaho’s government functions are run by its agencies, commissions and councils. To get a sense of what those agencies need, they submit detailed budget requests to the governor’s budget staff within the Division of Financial Management well ahead of the legislative session. 
The administrator of the Division of Financial Management then works with those agencies and with the governor to create the governor’s state budget proposal.

Gov. Brad Little, nor any other governor, cannot ultimately set the budget. But on the first day of the legislative session, he stands before the Legislature and unveils his properties and his budget proposal for the next fiscal year. 
The governor’s proposals and agency requests then go to budget writers on JFAC. 
Each budget gets its own hearing in a format that has changed over the last couple of years. As of 2024, budget hearings are reduced to a roughly 90-minute presentation from the legislative budget staffer assigned to work on that agency’s budget, and short remarks by the head of that agency at the end. In the past, legislators heard three-hour long presentations from the agency directors themselves as they detailed how they’d spent prior funding and their needs for the upcoming year. 
Unlike other committees, the public at large never has a chance to weigh in on these hearings. 
The budget hearing schedule can be found online here.
 JFAC work groups craft budgets

The joint budget-writing committee was formed in the Idaho Legislature in the late 1960s, and at the time, was fairly unique among other state processes, said Jaclyn Kettler, a political science associate professor at Boise State University who researches state legislatures and teaches comparative state politics.  
Some states have committees in each chamber produce their own budget proposals, and then must find a way to reconcile them to approve one budget. Other states, as well as Congress, also sometimes do large omnibus budget bills that include spending for every agency and program. 
Members of the Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee listen to a presentation at the Idaho State Capitol building in Boise on Jan. 11, 2023. (Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)
For the most part, Idaho passes a budget for each agency in separate bills. However, with the changes adopted in 2024, the committee has since undergone a “maintenance” budget process and “enhancement process.” 
“Maintenance budgets” include the funding for agencies that has already been approved by the Legislature, but no new spending. These budgets are passed in around 10 omnibus bills that combine agencies under general topics such as public safety, general government or economic development. The committee votes on the 10 budgets all at once early in the legislative session. 
Then, new spending requests are considered line-by-line for each agency. To work on these requests and determine proposed budgets for each agency, JFAC is split into working groups for different agencies. 
Which lawmaker serves on which working group is not typically publicly shared, and the groups’ work is all done behind closed doors. 
Sometimes members who work on the agency disagree on how to set a budget. 
When it comes time to vote, members bring prepared motions to set how much state funding the agency gets as well as the authority to spend any federal money that agency may receive.
There is typically a motion made for one budget and a “substitute motion” made if there’s a competing budget proposal. If there’s a third proposal, a lawmaker can make an “amended substitute motion.” After that, there can be no further motions on an individual budget. 
The committee votes on the most recently made motion first. For instance, if there was an amended substitute motion to spend $1,000 of general funds on ice cream for the Idaho Ice Cream Commission (a fictitious agency example), that would be the first motion to get a vote. If the motion dies, the committee would move on to the substitute motion to spend $2,500 on ice cream. 
If that motion also fails, the committee moves on to the original motion of $1,200 on ice cream. If all three motions fail, the work groups must get back to work and bring something different for the committee to vote on again.  
Much of the focus of the state budget is on the state’s general fund, which consists of unobligated money that the state uses to pay many of its bills and to enact policies. 
For fiscal year 2025, the state’s total budget, using all sources, is about $13.9 billion. Federal and dedicated funds typically are earmarked for certain programs or projects. The state general fund budget was around $5.2 billion for fiscal year 2025. 
 JFAC members also approve ‘intent language’ 

Once the numbers for the budget are approved, the committee members will also vote on what’s called “intent language.” This language usually dictates how the money must be used or conditions for approval. Sometimes, it may require a report on how a certain grant was used, or clarifies that certain funds may only be used for a specified purpose. 
Intent language is part of the law, and agencies may face consequences for using the funds for other purposes. The committee has the authority to order an audit of use of funds if there’s suspected misuse. 
If the audit findings are serious enough, auditors may recommend referring the case to the state attorney general for criminal prosecution. Most times, the issues are resolved before legal proceedings are brought. 
 Approved budgets go to House and Senate floors 

Once budget numbers are approved by the committee, they go to legislative staffers to be drafted into a bill. This process can take a few days, after which the budgets would show up in the House or Senate floors calendars. It’s up to leadership to decide which chamber will hear the budget first. 
The bills must pass both chambers and go to the governor to be approved.

If the House or Senate votes down a bill, it goes back to JFAC budget writers who must get back with work groups to craft a new bill that will be more likely to pass. 
If a budget passes the Legislature, the governor may then veto it. If the governor vetoes an entire budget, it’s likely that JFAC would have to take it back up. The governor also has the option to do a “line item veto,” only striking one section of the bill. 
Little has used this line-item veto power one time, and it was to strike out a section of his own office’s budget that would have eliminated his emergency fund.

 Once the budget’s passed and signed into law — that’s it. Sine Die. 

Once every agency budget has been approved by both chambers of the Legislature and signed by the governor, that’s it. 
However, some budget bills may sometimes be held on reading calendars as “hostages,” keeping lawmakers in session until preferred policy bills move forward. 
Once all the negotiating is complete and the policy bills that are going to move forward are approved, the hostages are released, and the chamber may vote on the bill. 
At the end of the session, which includes paperwork and some procedural moves that can sometimes delay the actual adjournment. The final adjournment of the session is called “Sine Die,” Latin for “without day,” which indicates that the work is done until next year. 
During the interim between sessions, there may be work groups and task forces and other interim committees, but the Legislature as a whole won’t meet again unless a special session is called. 
The governor may convene a special session for a specific purpose, and as of a 2022 voter-approved state constitutional amendment, the Legislature may call itself into special session with approval from 60% of each chamber’s members.

Steven Jackson, D-Shreveport (Photo by Allison Allsop/Louisiana Illuminator)The Louisiana Board of Ethics has declined to waive most of the nearly $10,000 in fines state Rep. Steven Jackson, D-Shreveport, faced for not submitting his campaign finance and personal disclosure documents on time or properly. 

The board voted to reduce Jackson’s fines by $3,000 at his request, but he has a remaining fee balance of $6,720 to pay. 
The full reduction was also contingent on Jackson submitting some missing personal financial disclosure paperwork from 2023 by midnight Friday. Otherwise, the board said it would reinstate another $1,500 in penalties, for $8,220 in total. 
Jackson accrued the fees after he filed four ethics and campaign finance reports late and failed to file one at all. He also did not correct two reports the ethics board flagged for mismatching campaign account balances, which resulted in extra penalties. 

All but one of these reports was related to Jackson’s campaign for Louisiana House of Representatives in 2023. He also ran up thousands of dollars in fines previously when he ran for and served in Caddo Parish government. 
By his own estimate, Jackson had already paid $10,000 to $15,000 in penalties for missing deadlines for 15 old campaign finance reports, not including those before the board Friday.
“What I will tell you is none of what you see is intentional,” Jackson told board members. 
Jackson declined to talk to take additional questions from reporter after the hearing.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Campaign finance reports and personal financial disclosure paperwork are the primary way the public knows who donates to a political campaign and what conflict officials might have. Hundreds of candidates, elected officials and public employees are required to file them each year. 
As a state legislator, Jackson told the board he now has better systems in place to make sure his campaign finance and personal finance disclosure forms are filed on time. 
“Now that I’m in the legislature, we have staff that comes around that reminds us. I have a staff person in my office that has a calendar set,” Jackson said. “I am now able to pay a CPA to remind me. So I get three reminders now to submit my personal financial disclosure or to file for that extension if needed.” 
Ethics board members were reluctant to reduce Jackson’s fines further because of his poor track record meeting past deadlines. 
“You have a history going way back of late filings, and you paid a fine numerous times. And that’s not setting a great example for your citizens, your constituents,” said board member John Crigler, a retired judge from St. Joseph. 
Jackson responded by saying he tried to take responsibility for missing those deadlines by paying large penalties in the past. 
“That’s me taking ownership in my part, in my role and my responsibility in that,” he responded.  

Yet when Jackson had paid ethics fines in the past, his hand has often been forced to do so. 

The ethics board filed a short-lived lawsuit in August 2019 to block Jackson from qualifying to run for his second term on the Caddo Parish Commission over $3,600 in late fees for his 2015 race. State law requires candidates for public office to pay their penalties in full before they enter a new election cycle. The suit was withdrawn a day later after Jackson hastily met with the board and paid some of the fines he owed. 
Over a separate group of fines, the attorney general’s office in 2022 garnished more than $1,000 monthly from Jackson’s paychecks for three months. 
Jackson also pushed back with the board Friday on the newer fines that were under consideration. 

He said he had never received the board’s written warnings about one of them because his mail had been picked up by campaign volunteers from a shared post office box and never handed to him. Jackson now has a new mailbox he doesn’t share with others, he said. 

The board has also struggled to deliver late fee notices to Jackson via certified mail, which requires a recipient’s signature. Four attempts to send penalty notices to Jackson went unsigned from August 2024 to March 2025, according to information the ethics board staff provided.
Eventually, Ethics Administrator David Bordelon personally hand delivered Jackson’s most recent late notices directly to Jackson while the representative was at the State Capitol on April 23 for the 2025 legislative session. 
Jackson said he is always open to contact from the ethics board and its staff. 

“What I will tell you is that I always try to make myself available,” he said. 
Yet Jackson was given several months to correct problems on two campaign finance reports that would have reduced or eliminated some of his fines altogether and he didn’t, said Charles Reeves, an ethics board attorney. 
“We spoke to [Jackson’s] attorney multiple times, and she assured us that [a report change] was forthcoming, and when we reviewed the investigation report, it had not been amended,” Reeves told the board. 
One time, the ethics board staff reached Jackson by phone to talk about his inaccurate or late campaign finance reports, and Jackson said he could not talk because he was on his way to the gym. The state representative said he would call the staff back but never did, Reeves said. 
By the end of Friday’s hearing, Jackson appeared frustrated and confused over the ethics board not further reducing his fines. 
“I followed the staff’s recommendation, and I got here today only to find out that the recommendation that the staff gave me didn’t resolve the problem,” Jackson said. “I just want to be clear. What do I owe at this point and what is still outstanding?”
The board voted 10-0 to reduce two $2,500 fines by $1,500 each and 7-3 to keep the remaining five fines, totaling $4,720, the same.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/LaIllum-01-1024x681.jpg,,,2026-01-12 06:12:23.844289

Jan. 11, 2025. | Photo by Erick Diaz Veliz/Michigan AdvanceDozens of candles illuminated the Mill Pond in Brighton on Sunday evening in honor of Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother who was killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis during a morning raid on January 7th.
Around 100 people from Brighton and the surrounding area, holding anti-ICE signs and candles, gathered at the vigil to honor Good and to protest against ICE in an event organized by the Indivisible Livingston Group.
“We are gathered here this evening with a variety of emotions, but beginning with grief for what happened to Renee Good and for grief for what is happening in our country,” said Reverend Rudra Dundzila of Community Unitarian Universalists church.
The murder of Good, shot by an unmasked ICE agent identified by the Minnesota Star Tribune as Jonathan Ross, 43, during the confrontation, led thousands of demonstrators to take to the streets around the country to protest against the federal agents and their immigrant crackdown.

Multiple vigils, rallies, and protests have been held in Good’s honor across the country since her killing, including from coast to coast in Michigan.
“We pray for peace for our country and for finding ways of reconciliation and communication, and talking with each other. For the common good of all people that we live with in our country. This is what we invoke tonight in our vigil,” Dundzila finished.
The video of Good’s death went viral worldwide in a matter of hours, generating polarized opinions. Kelly Lovelady, 58, who has lived in Brighton for almost 30 years, says she watched the video repeatedly and disagrees with the federal government’s “gaslighting” statements about the situation.
Republican officials from the president on down were quick to defend Ross, claiming he fired in self-defense and standing with ICE. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem mentioned that the officer acted based on how he was trained to act in situations like that and described Good as a “domestic terrorist.” In a Truth Social post, President Donald Trump called protesters “professional agitators” and blamed the “radical left movement of violence and hate.”

“We’re supposed to be allowed to protest in the United States, and we are supposed to have constitutional rights that are being trampled on right now. And if we allow this to stop us from coming out, they win, and we lose, and we lose more than what is there today. We lose the future for our kids that we had when we were growing up,” Lovelady added.
Some attendees chose to march along a section of the small lake with their candles and signs in hand. Carrying an inverted flag, Simon Ren, 67, said that attending the vigil is a duty.
“Being a citizen comes with responsibilities, not just privileges,” Ren said.
Since Good’s death, politicians in Michigan have been no exception to the polarization of opinions, with Democrats condemning the shooting and Republicans defending Ross. However, for Richard Gienapp, a member of the Indivisible Livingston Group, there are many mixed emotions among the people.
“I know there’s a range of emotions that bring people here tonight, and we really want to acknowledge those emotions. Whether it’s anger, outrage, sadness, grief, or frustration,” Gienapp says.
Protests demand accountability
Amidst the various vigils to honor Good, there were also numerous protests focusing on the actions of ICE, specifically in regard to her death, but more generally opposed to the Trump administration’s use of the agency to disregard constitutional rights and carry out its mass deportation agenda.
They ranged from larger gatherings in Detroit and Grand Rapids, to smaller communities across Michigan. On Saturday, dozens of protestors gathered in Howell for an event organized locally by Stand Against Extremism Livingston County.
Among those attending the rally was Mariah McDonald of Brighton, a mother who said she has been attending protests regularly and felt compelled to speak out after Good’s death.
“I’m here to show my support for people in the United States and for immigrants,” McDonald said. “They make America great. I want to raise my kids in a country that accepts all and loves all.”

McDonald said she has not been surprised by the polarized response to video of the shooting circulating online, noting that even among friends, there are starkly different interpretations of what happened.
“It’s frustrating,” she said. “Some people believe one narrative without looking at the bigger picture. I just wish people would be more open-minded.”
She also expressed skepticism that Good’s death alone would lead to meaningful change, pointing to past moments of national outrage that failed to result in lasting reforms.
“How many times have we said, ‘This is going to be the spark?’” McDonald said. “George Floyd was supposed to be the spark. Kids being zip-tied was supposed to be the spark. It only changes if we keep showing up and saying this is not OK.”

Curtis Hamilton of Howell said he attended the vigil not only to mourn Good, but to speak out against what he sees as an alarming political trajectory.
“This is a vigil for that woman who was killed in Minneapolis, but it’s more than that,” Hamilton said. “When you look at all the people who have died in ICE custody, too many people are asleep to what’s going on.”
Hamilton, who described himself as a student of history, compared current trends to those seen in authoritarian movements abroad.
“This is the same playbook that Mussolini and Hitler went through, the same playbook used by authoritarians in Hungary and elsewhere,” he said. “We’re living through it right now.”

The annual speech, which is roughly the Idaho’ equivalent of the State of the Union address, is scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. Mountain time at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. 
There are multiple ways to watch the speech and stay engaged with state government during the 2026 legislative session. 
The speech will be streamed live online, for free, via the Idaho in Session service and clicking on the “House stream” feed. After the speech ends, the streaming video will be available in the Idaho in Session digital media archives. 
Additionally, free public seating (which usually fills up well before the speech begins) is available in the public seating gallery above the House Chambers at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise.
The State of the State address is always a closely-watched speech in Idaho government and political circles because it gives the governor a very public forum to lay out policy goals for the year, present budget recommendations, highlight certain programs or initiatives and provide an overall assessment of the “state” of Idaho. 
 Idaho Legislature’s committee meetings, floor sessions to again be streamed online

Once again, the Idaho in Session service will livestream all of the Idaho Legislature’s committee meetings and floor sessions each day during the 2026 session. 
The Idaho Legislature’s website is updated daily with the committee agendas and floor calendars that indicate what the Idaho Legislature is working on and voting on each day.

Once they are introduced and read across the desk, all bills introduced by the Idaho Legislature will also be posted online for the public to access.
All floor sessions of the Idaho House of Representatives and Idaho Senate and all committee meetings, generally, are also open to the public and feature public seating available at the Idaho State Capitol, 700 W. Jefferson St. 
Legislative committees accept public testimony during public hearings on bills under consideration by the committee. Information about testifying before a legislative committee is available on the Idaho Legislature’s website. Some legislative committee chairpersons require members of the public to sign up in advance to testify before their committee. 
 



 Idaho Agriculture Day is Tuesday at the Idaho State Capitol

State officials are inviting the public and elected officials to connect with farmers and members of the state’s agriculture industry during Idaho Agriculture Day on Tuesday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. 
Hosted by the Idaho State Department of Agriculture, the free event features food samples, interactive activities and information booths. Events are scheduled to run from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. on the second floor of the Statehouse. 
“(The Idaho State Department of Agriculture) invites attendees to engage directly with farmers, ranchers and commodity group representatives while sampling foods that showcase Idaho produced commodities and products,” state officials wrote in a press release issued Jan. 6.
“Idaho Agriculture Day serves as a platform for dialogue and connection offering state leaders and the public insight into how agriculture and food processing fuels our communities and contributes more than 26 billion dollars to Idaho’s economy,” officials added.
Several representatives from Idaho’s agriculture industry are scheduled to participate in the events, including officials from the Idaho Apple Commission, Idaho Barley Commission, Idaho Beef Commission, the Idaho Water Users Association, the Idaho Dairymen’s Association, the Idaho Wheat Commission, the Snake River Sugarbeet Growers Association and more.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)COLUMBIA, Tenn. — Columbia’s City Council on Thursday approved water rate hikes of up to 20% per year over the next five years to fund a new $520 million intake on the Duck River and a new water treatment plant.
The rate increase will affect Columbia Power and Water Systems’ 27,000 customers, as well as thousands more served by other water systems that buy water from Columbia Power and Water. New rates go into effect on March 1, according to the new rate schedule.
The council approved the new rates 5-2, with Council member Charlie Huffman and Columbia Mayor Chaz Molder voting no. The council also unanimously approved an increase of the utility’s impact fee for new customers, creating potential future revenue that could reduce the need to raise customer rates, according to the utility’s CEO, Jonathan Hardin.
The vote followed weeks of intense debate and input from residents of Columbia and surrounding cities that purchase water from the utility. Dozens of people packed the Columbia Council’s chambers Thursday night to speak ahead of the vote, with the majority asking council members to delay the decision and examine alternatives in hopes of finding a cheaper option.
Proposed Columbia water rate increase for new infrastructure clears first vote

Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation Water Resources Division Director April Grippo said other ideas that have been pitched would require additional study.
“We are not aware of another alternative that is as mature as Columbia Power and Water’s that would be available for the next several years,” she said during a council meeting on Tuesday.
Staff from Columbia Power and Water Systems and the state’s water division said the project, which has been under consideration for at least 10 years and has cleared state environment and wildlife oversight, is necessary to ensure continued water delivery as the region’s needs grow. Water systems are required by the state to plan for expansion when they meet 80% of their capacity, and the Columbia utility is at 93% capacity now, Grippo said.
Elected officials representing Maury County residents opposed the rate increase or advocated for city leaders to delay the vote and explore other options, including Maury County Mayor Sheila Butt, multiple Maury County commissioners, and State Rep. Scott Cepicky, a Culleoka Republican. 
Maury County residents living outside of Columbia city limits repeatedly said they felt disenfranchised by the rate approval process. Columbia Power and Water Systems is a city utility that sells water at wholesale rates to other nearby water systems serving a combined 35,000 customers in Maury County, Spring Hill and Mount Pleasant, but rate changes are approved solely by the Columbia City Council.
A few speakers, including Trent Ogilvie, who sat on the Columbia utility’s board in 2018, recalled the project was estimated to cost $225 million at the time, compared to more than $500 million eight years later.
“But yet, we say, let’s continue to wait,” he said.
Plans for the project have been publicly available on the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation’s website since 2021, and the state has hosted nine public meetings on the project since 2020.
Ward 1 Council member Carl McCullen initially voted against the proposal in December, but supported the measure on Thursday. McCullen recalled discussions about persistent and intensifying water supply issues stretching back decades.
Columbia considers water rate hike of up to 150% over next 5 years for new intake, treatment plant

“Water’s a problem. You can’t keep putting it off, and pause it … I think it’s time for us to do something about that,” McCullen said.
What this means for water bills
The new water rate schedule allows Columbia Power and Water to increase rates up to 20% each year, but Hardin and Columbia Vice Mayor Randy McBroom have referred to this cap as the “worst case scenario.”
The low-interest federal and state loans that will fund the project require stress tests that do not allow the utility to assume any new revenue will come from a growing customer base or new customer impact fees. 
All customers will see a 20% hike in their water bill in the first year, according to the utility, but Columbia Power and Water expects increases in years three through five will be lower.
Annual cost of service studies will determine increases for each type of customer — including industrial customers, wholesale customers, and customers inside and outside of the city limits — for years two through five.
For an average monthly bill for 5,000 gallons for a Columbia Water and Power System customer inside city limits, a customer paying a $34.75 water bill might pay up to $86.47 by 2030, according to the utility. An average customer outside city limits may go from paying $45.25 for 5,000 gallons to as much as $112.60 by 2030. 
Multiple speakers at Thursday’s meeting said those higher rates will be detrimental to farmers, elderly residents, those on fixed incomes and households that are already struggling to keep up with bills. Several lamented that “past sins” and continued approval of new development without matching infrastructure are to blame.
“If you don’t have the resources, you can’t have the people here,” Joey Davenport said. “If I have an empty glass of water and I have a full glass of water, what does it matter if you can’t afford that full glass? It’s no different than the empty glass.”
Maury County Water System customers already pay higher rates than Columbia Water and Power customers, because the county utility buys its water from Columbia’s utility at wholesale prices and sells it to county customers after adding on additional costs. This particularly concerned farmers and those who live on rural land outside of the reach of the city’s utility. 
Jason Gilliam, a member of the Maury County Water System Board, said the extra cost for county water system customers has to do with economy of scale. Columbia has about 500 miles of pipe in the ground and about 27,000 customers, while Maury County Water System has 475 miles of pipe in the ground and serves 8,800. Gilliam, who also chairs the county’s Republican Party and leads a group advocating for the construction of a new dam in Columbia, also urged the council to vote against the raise.
“I’m not going to waste any more time discussing the enormous cost of the project or the detriment it would cost to so many people that live here — those who have spent their entire lives here, making this place what it is,” he said. “I want to remind you … of your role on the city council … you said that you wanted to serve your community.”
Molder, who voted against the increase, said “this is the right project at the wrong time,” and he could not justify a vote in favor due to concerns about skyrocketing costs of living.
Molder is also in the running to represent Tennessee’s fifth Congressional district, which covers portions of Maury, Davidson, Lewis, Marshall, Wilson and Williamson counties.
Columbia Power and Water will send out sample bills to each ratepayer so they know what to expect on their bills after March 1.
Project details
The higher impact fee and water rates will allow Columbia’s water utility to secure low-interest, long-term loans from the state and federal governments.The $520 million price tag includes all project costs, including design, construction and mitigation, according to Columbia Power and Water.
The new intake will be located downstream from the utility’s current intake at Riverside Drive. The new intake can withdraw up to 32 million gallons of water per day from the Duck River, 12 million gallons more than the current intake is permitted to withdraw.
Grippo said the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation would not approve raising the withdrawal cap at the Riverside Drive intake because water flow at that portion of the river is too low to sustain it. Flow is higher downstream.
The utility has already secured 63% of the land easements needed for the project, and anticipates it will hold 75% in the next two to three weeks, Hardin said.
Work on the intake and water treatment plant is slated to begin in Spring 2026 and conclude in summer 2029.

(File: NC Newsline)When a mental health crisis strikes a classroom in Hyde County Schools, a school psychologist does not walk down the hall.
There isn’t one.
Instead, administrators begin a series of phone calls to outside providers or neighboring districts. Then, they wait.
“We are provided those services by somebody that we call in, but that’s not always easy,” said Melanie Shaver, superintendent of Hyde County Schools. “They have a very set schedule. And when you do have a crisis, which you do, we really rely on other districts to help us out.”
Between the 2020–21 and mid-2024–25 school years, 14 North Carolina districts have operated without a staff psychologist, according to data provided by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction.
Districts contract with outside providers to meet legal requirements for special-education evaluations. But students still lack consistent access to a psychologist for ongoing mental health support, including preventive care.
In practice, students in crisis may sometimes wait hours or days for help.
School district leaders cite funding constraints and a statewide shortage of school psychologists, a problem that hits rural districts hardest, where many have no full-time staff and lack the resources to compete with larger, wealthier districts.
***
A 2025 School-Based Mental Health Plan report found that more than half of school leaders cited insufficient staffing as the biggest barrier to student safety. The report described mental health services in many districts as “reactive rather than systematic,” with schools responding to crises instead of preventing them.
School psychologists are the only school-based professionals trained to conduct legally required special-education evaluations while also providing preventive mental health services. They are part of a broader support network that includes counselors, social workers and nurses.
“When your only access to a school psychologist is someone who appears once a week or twice a month, you lose the preventative and consultative work they’re also trained to provide,” said Deirdre Martyn, president of the North Carolina School Psychology Association. “You’re only putting out fires.”
Most of the districts without psychologists are clustered in rural northeastern North Carolina, where high-poverty communities overlap with limited mental health infrastructure. Along with Hyde County, the districts include Cherokee, Gates, Granville, Hertford, Mitchell, Northampton, Warren and Washington counties, as well as the city systems in Hickory, Roanoke Rapids, Weldon, Clinton and Elkin.
National guidelines recommend one school psychologist for every 500 students. In North Carolina, the ratio is closer to one for every 1,928 students. Even in districts that have psychologists on staff, many are split across multiple schools.
Martyn said that was her experience working in a rural North Carolina county, where she rotated among three schools spread miles apart.
“On the days I was in a school building, my time was almost entirely consumed by legally required evaluations,” she said. “I would test five or six students and then leave to write reports on another day, which makes it very difficult to build relationships with students and families or to provide the comprehensive, preventative services schools need.”
“We are almost four times the recommended level,” said Michelle Ries, president and CEO of the North Carolina Institute of Medicine. “Regardless of whether a district has a psychologist or not, those we do have are overwhelmed.”
For North Carolinians aged 10 to 17, suicide is now the third-leading cause of death, Ries noted. “When you don’t have psychologists who are able to recognize early signs,” she said, “you put kids more at risk.”
***
The absence of psychologists creates ripple effects across schools, said Leigh Kokenes, who also represents NCSPA. Without psychologists to conduct behavior assessments or develop prevention plans, that work often falls to teachers and social workers who are already stretched thin, Kokenes said.
“In our rural communities across North Carolina, where many times there are no school psychologists in schools, the mental health needs of children remain untreated,” Kokenes said. “Triage occurs and the gaps are filled in the moment, but the root cause will not be resolved without comprehensive care over time.”
And without a specialist to guide intervention, discipline often becomes the default response, she said.
The 2025 state report found that staffing shortages have reduced schools’ ability to make referrals and provide consistent follow-up. When mental health teams are missing key members, students often lose continuity of care — the person who evaluates a child one week may not be there to follow up the next.
***
Patrick Miller, former superintendent of Greene County Schools, said his district went three years without a psychologist. “The person we worked with was excellent, but she served multiple districts,” Miller said. “We had to get in line. If something urgent came up, you were at the mercy of her schedule.”
Contracting was also more expensive, he said, and more limited. “You get assessments. You don’t get the full role. Kids don’t stop needing support because the contract hours are over.”
For Hyde County, that arrangement means relying on mobile crisis units for mental health emergencies, Shaver said, with responses typically arriving within the day. Students who need ongoing care are referred to outside agencies or primary care providers.
The district budgets about $80,000 a year for contracted psychological services, she said, and completes special education evaluations within the required 90-day window.
In Weldon City Schools, Superintendent Tammy Boone relies on partnerships that bring private providers onto campus daily. She described the arrangement as a stopgap until the district can secure funds for a full-time staffer.
Recruitment adds another challenge. Compared with larger, wealthier districts that can offer salary supplements to attract and retain talent, rural districts with smaller tax bases rely largely on grant funding, especially now that federal funding has expired.
“Sometimes it can be a challenge to attract people to this area, especially when there are so many other larger areas that border us,” Boone said.
A majority of districts surveyed in the 2025 state report cited inadequate funding as their primary issue.
***
Shaver said Hyde County faces the same hurdle. “We don’t have maybe some of the sign-on bonuses or supplements that other counties have that tend to help recruit,” Shaver said.
But that may soon change.
In the 2026-27 school year, the district expects to have a staff psychologist for the first time in years.
Kathryn Oneal Brown, a longtime special education teacher in Hyde County, decided to pursue the role herself. “It’s nice to have someone who really knows a student and can do a comprehensive evaluation … versus someone just coming in, giving a test, and then that’s their limited interaction with the student,” Brown said. “I think just, you know, better data.”
In 2023, she enrolled in a virtual graduate program through Eastern Washington University, driving to neighboring counties on Fridays for unpaid practicum work. “I wouldn’t have been able to do this if there was no virtual option,” Brown said.
State lawmakers are now trying to expand that pathway. During the 2025 legislative session, legislators introduced Senate Bill 259, a $20.4 million proposal that would provide monthly salary supplements for school psychologists and fund a virtual training program at Appalachian State University.
But the 2025 state report warns that without a shift toward sustained, recurring funding, any progress made by such initiatives could be short-lived.
Meantime, Boone’s district is seeking grant funding for a full-time school psychologist.
“Everything in North Carolina tends to be a funding issue,” said Boone.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/return-to-school.jpg,,,2026-01-12 06:12:23.844289

The law bars transgender athletes from competing on girls’ and women’s sports teams in public schools and colleges. It does not ban transgender males from competing on boys’ or men’s teams. 
Supreme Court justices are expected to decide whether West Virginia’s law violates Title IV, which prohibits discrimination based on sex in education programs and activities that receive federal financial assistance, and the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, which prohibits states from denying equal protection of the law to anyone within its jurisdiction.                                                                                                                                                                    
In a news release, West Virginia attorney general J.B. McCuskey called the case “monumental” not only for West Virginia, but for the entire country. The outcome of the case will impact the future of women’s sports, the promises of Title IX, and the safety of our daughters, he said in the news release.
“We are hopeful that the Supreme Court will uphold the Save Women’s Sports Act and agree with what West Virginia has been saying for years: biological sex matters in sports, and allowing males to compete against female athletes is unfair and dangerous,” McCuskey said in the news release.
Billy Wolfe, a spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia, which is representing Pepper-Jackson in the case, said the state’s transgender athlete ban is part of a broader national effort to target transgender people and use them as political cudgel. 
“There is, of course, no threat posed by Becky Pepper-Jackson to women in West Virginia sports,” Wolfe said. “We’re a state of 1.8 million people, and there is one single trans girl in this state who wants to play sports with her friends. She doesn’t represent a threat to the existence of women’s sports in any way. Sadly, all of this stuff is about politics.”
Speaking to reporters Thursday afternoon, McCuskey said it was “slightly disingenuous” to argue that the state’s transgender athlete ban affects only Pepper-Jackson. 
“It’s decidedly not about one person,” McCuskey said. “It’s about the totality of athletics in West Virginia.”
“We want to make sure that the playing fields are delineated by their biological sex,” he said. 
Along with Pepper-Jackson’s challenge, the Supreme Court on Tuesday will also hear arguments in Little v. Hecox, which challenges Idaho’s transgender athlete ban.
Dale Melchert, senior staff attorney for the Transgender Law Center, said the two cases are narrow and specific to the students who have filed the challenges, but decisions by the Supreme Court can have broad impacts. 
“At the end of the day, this is really about whether or not all students are able to receive the same benefits of education,” Melchert said. “Athletics are a key part of community life and educational life. They’re a place where young people get to learn about being on a team, building self confidence, learning leadership skills, or simply just playing and having fun. But bans like West Virginia’s and and Idaho’s, they’re blanket bans that make it impossible, regardless of the specifics of any individual trans girl, to play.”
In July 2021, US District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia issued a preliminary injunction allowing Pepper-Jackson to continue competing on the girls’ cross-country and track and field teams while the case moved forward. In 2023, the court ruled that the law is constitutional, dissolving the preliminary injunction and granting summary judgement for the state of West Virginia.
In 2023, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals granted Pepper-Jackson’s request to keep playing while the case was being appealed. In April 2024, the same court ruled in favor of Pepper-Jackson, reversing the Southern District’s decision. In the latter decision, the court ruled that the law violates transgender students’ rights under Title IX, a federal civil rights law prohibiting discrimination based on sex in education programs.
Wolfe said according to the ACLU’s count, Becky Pepper Jackson’s case is only the third case in recent history to have originated in West Virginia to go before the U.S. Supreme Court. In Barnett vs. the West Virginia Board of Education during World War II, the ACLU of West Virginia represented two Jehovah’s Witnesses students who successfully challenged a school requirement to recite the Pledge of Allegiance, which went against their religion. In 2022, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of West Virginia and other Republican-led states that sought to limit the federal Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to limit carbon emissions. 
The ACLU of West Virginia is chartering a bus to Washington, D.C. so that supporters of Pepper-Jackson can join a rally outside the U.S. Supreme Court as the case is being heard. The bus will pick up passengers in Charleston, Martinsburg and Morgantown.
Wolfe said the bus rides and rally can be a community-building exercise for people against legislation designed to make marginalized people feel like they’re all alone with a target on their back. 
“I think that these events tend to bring people together, remind them that they’re not alone, that there are people who are in this fight with them,” Wolfe said. “And so it makes for, I think, a very positive atmosphere. Even though we know that what we’re fighting for is very serious. It’s very harmful stuff that we’re pushing back against.”

Nancy Mace runs for governor, a whopping 14 candidates have announced bids to replace her in Congress, making the race for the coastal 1st District by far the most crowded among South Carolina’s 2026 elections for state or federal offices. 
The field breaks down to 10 Republicans and four Democrats. Five are military veterans. Many are first-time candidates: They include a mechanic, a waiter, and a Marine pardoned for his participation in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.


The 14 announced candidates
Republicans: Dan Brown, Jay Byars, Logan Cunningham, Tyler Dykes, Jack Ellison, Jenna Costa Honeycutt, Sam McCown, Justin Myers, Mark Smith, and Alex Pelbath
Democrats: Mac Deford, Max Diaz, Matt Fulmer, and Mayra Rivera-Vázquez


State Rep. Mark Smith of Daniel Island is the only legislator. Three other Republicans — Logan Cunningham, Jay Byars, and Jenny Costa Honeycutt — have elected experience as county councilmembers. One Democrat has political experience as a former county chair. Another Democrat ran for the seat unsuccessfully two years ago.  
On their websites and in conversations with the SC Daily Gazette, most Republican candidates put a heavy emphasis on border security and reducing the national debt. Some called for hardline policies to curtail immigration. 
Alex Pelbath, a retired lieutenant colonel in the Air Force who lives in Mount Pleasant, supports President Donald Trump’s effort to end birthright citizenship. Tyler Dykes of Bluffton, a Marine Corps veteran, told the SC Daily Gazette he’d like to ban or halt most immigration of any kind.
Byars and Cunningham highlight their desire to preserve the Lowcountry’s natural resources. 
Cunningham, who sits on Beaufort County Council, says on his campaign website that his top local priority is protecting the Lowcountry’s waterways and coastline. 
Byars, on Dorchester County Council, calls himself a “conservative conservationist.” He told the Gazette he wants to emulate Teddy Roosevelt, his favorite president, by protecting public land and national parks.

Many candidates are pitching voters on their non-polarizing style. 
“When the conversation becomes more about focusing on clickbait that’s going to generate some cheap donor ads, that’s where things really start going off the rails,” said Byars. “I tell people all the time: some of my best friends are left-leaning, left-thinking Democratic folks,” he said. “We can have a conversation, we can debate seriously, and then we can go grab a pizza and a beer afterwards.”
“Too many politicians chase headlines instead of fixing real problems, and that’s not who I am,” Honeycutt, a lawyer on Charleston County Council, began her statement to the Gazette.
 Republican Justin Myers, a Navy veteran who lives in Charleston and owns a moving business, has repeatedly called for unity across parties on his campaign Facebook account. Last month, he applauded California Gov. Gavin Newsom for praising Turning Points co-founder Charlie Kirk, who was killed last September while debating college students in Utah. 
The four Democrats include Mac Deford, a Coast Guard veteran and Charleston-area attorney who ran for the same seat in 2024 and lost his party’s primary by 3 percentage points. Mayra Rivera-Vázquez, whose parents are Puerto Rican, is a retired paralegal and former chair of the Beaufort County Democratic Party.

The other two Democrats are political newcomers. Their platforms include creating a single, government-provided health insurance system funded by taxpayers that covers all residents nationwide.
The 1st District had a Democratic congressman in not-too-distant memory: Joe Cunningham flipped the seat for a single term before Mace ousted him in 2020. 
After the 2020 census, the district was redrawn to favor Republicans. Mace won re-election in 2024 with over 58% of the vote against a Democratic challenger she barely acknowledged.
The SC Daily Gazette called each candidate that has filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission and reached 11 of the 14 candidates who publicly announced their bids. 
Immigration
Many Republicans cited mass immigration as one of the top issues they want to address in Congress.

In a statement to the Gazette, Pelbath said families were being “crushed” by both higher prices and open borders. His campaign website says he wants to solve those problems by deporting every immigrant not legally in the United States and bringing jobs home. 
Pelbath piloted the last American plane out of Kabul when American troops withdrew from Afghanistan, The Post and Courier reported. 
Dykes, a 27-year-old salesman, said in an interview that the rising cost of living and mass immigration were the “two biggest issues” impacting people in the Lowcountry area. He said he supports solving both problems through mass deportations and ending all work visas for noncitizens. 
Dykes pleaded guilty to assaulting law enforcement during the U.S. Capitol riot that followed the “Stop the Steal” rally five years ago.
The FBI arrested him in July 2023. He was sentenced a year later to 57 months in federal prison but was released after Trump pardoned him among more than 1,500 others convicted for their roles. He told the SC Daily Gazette he pleaded guilty just to get a deal but “never touched” an officer.

Deford, a Democrat, said he believed border security and immigration were among the top issues in the 1st district. He said he intercepted drug shipments and defended U.S. borders when he worked for the Coast Guard. Unlike most Republicans in the race, he criticized Trump’s immigration crackdown and the administration’s recent capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.  
“These things can all be true: Maduro is a thug. America must lead. And we cannot lead the free world by breaking our own laws and bypassing Congress,” Deford wrote on X.
Six of the Republican candidates have publicly praised or supported Trump’s capture of Maduro on social media.
Dykes appeared to take a different approach: He recently retweeted a 2019 post from Trump that reads “The Endless Wars Must End!”
Republican Jack Ellison of Charleston wrote on social media that Trump should have gotten congressional approval.

“Maduro is a criminal — the head of a corrupt regime that has trampled democracy, destroyed its economy, and driven millions to flee. That needs to be stated plainly,” wrote the Army veteran. “But how the United States responds matters. Any serious action — military, economic, or diplomatic — must have the support of Congress and the American people. Acting without that legitimacy weakens our position and our credibility abroad.”

Smith, who replaced Mace in the state House, was the first candidate to announce a bid to replace her in the U.S. House. 
His campaign launch video prominently featured Trump. In his video, Smith touted his support in the Legislature for state income tax cuts and a special immigration enforcement unit at the State Law Enforcement Division. The unit existed prior to his 2020 election to the House. In 2024, Smith voted for a law that moved it from the state Department of Public Safety to SLED.
“Mark Smith will join President Trump to bring us into a golden age,” Smith, the CEO of McAlister-Smith Funeral Homes, said in the video.
Cost of living 
Almost all candidates emphasized the rising cost of living as a problem they want to help solve.

Dan Brown, a Bluffton Republican who works at a Land Rover dealership, said he decided to run when he first saw his baby son’s ultrasound. 
“I just want him and everyone of his generation and the generations after that to grow up and live in an America that gives all the opportunities that I and my generation have had,” Brown said in an interview. 
He, Smith, and Honeycutt call for reducing the national debt and cutting government spending as a way to make life more affordable in the Lowcountry.

Charleston physician and businessman Dr. Sam McCown said in an interview that America was facing an “affordability crisis,” as he criticized the cost of health insurance. McCown encouraged the use of Health Savings Accounts, as a U.S. Senate GOP plan seeks to do, saying that will give consumers more choice.
He also said the health care industry is over-regulated and called for policies that would limit lawsuits and potential payouts. Doctors often order exams patients don’t need just to protect themselves from a potential lawsuit, he said, and that drives up cost.
Democrat Matt Fulmer, a Hilton Head waiter, advocated for getting rid of private insurance and transitioning to a system where everyone gets health insurance from the government. He told the Gazette he’s not dissuaded by advice that Democrat candidates in Republican-leaning districts should “not rock the boat” with their policy ideas.

Max Diaz works as a mechanic and lives in Hanahan. (Courtesy of Max Diaz’s campaign)
“I think that strategy is a lot more appealing when people are doing well,” Fulmer said. “When people are experiencing this level of economic pain, they are looking for big solutions.” 
Democrat Max Diaz, a 25-year-old Hanahan mechanic, told the Gazette he also wants a single, government-provided health insurance program. 
One issue has bipartisan appeal in the field: stopping large investment firms from buying up single-family homes.
Last Wednesday, Trump announced he wants to ban the practice.
Democrats Diaz and Fulmer, as well as Dykes, the pardoned Republican, like that idea. They advocate for proposals that would tax or stop investment companies from buying single-family homes or apartment complexes.  
McCown, Smith, Pelbath, Deford, Byars, Rivera-Vazquez, and Diaz have reported campaign donations through September. McCown had the most cash on hand — over $1 million — after putting in $865,100 of his own money.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/capitoloct1-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-12 06:12:23.844289

unanimously passed House Bill 4667 on Monday, March 4, 2024. The bill would make it illegal for any syringe service program seeking licensure or looking to maintain its license to distribute safe smoking supplies to people who use drugs. It now heads to the governor. (West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia state agencies — in charge of schools, road repairs, foster care and more — along with the state Supreme Court have been asked by the Morrisey administration to cut their budgets by 2%.
Additionally, an August memo from the Department of Revenue told agencies, “Additional state funding should not be requested to replace lost federal funding.”
Spending cuts under President Donald Trump are likely to impact states like West Virginia that are constitutionally-bound to balance their budgets. 
As West Virginia agencies prepare budget requests for the next fiscal year, the state is going to lose hundreds of millions of federal dollars for important programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program this year and in the coming years, making it one of the hardest hit states by federal funding cuts. 
West Virginia is the nation’s most federally-dependent state, meaning the state relies on federal dollars to operate critical programs. 
West Virginia “can’t just absorb all of the reductions or changes that may come from other places,” Gov. Patrick Morrisey told reporters Jan. 5. The governor has been focusing on weeding out “wasteful spending” in state government, issuing an executive order that asked agencies to review their spending to highlight inefficiencies. 
“We have to live within our means, and I’m working to make sure that there’s a continued period of strength where we’re managing our budget very, very carefully,” Morrisey said, adding that his administration would continue to invest in problems like too many foster children sent out of state.
The Morrissey administration did not provide an estimate of how much federal funding the state has lost in the last year.
Kelly Allen
Kelly Allen, executive director at the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, said there will be a significant impact on residents if the state doesn’t fill in the gaps left by lost federal dollars.
“I understand the pressure and probably the frustration that state lawmakers are under having all these federal costs shifted down onto the state budget,” Allen said. “If people don’t understand why services are suffering, then they’re going to blame the wrong people, like the people in that agency, rather than people actually understanding it’s all of these federal cuts.”
A December report from the center said, “West Virginia’s revenue and economic numbers signal concerns for the FY 2027 budget and the state’s ability to invest in programs proven to help families and workers thrive,” noting several years of lawmakers’ passing skinny budgets.
Along with the agency budget reductions, Morrisey called for cuts to the state’s personal income tax, and the Republican-led Legislature will have to approve his plan. Morrisey said the state could “deliver meaningful tax relief without sacrificing essential services” due to his administration’s work on agency budgets in the past year.

West Virginia will lose millions of federal dollars for Medicaid, SNAP
Federal budget slashes are expected to heavily impact the West Virginia Department of Human Services, which oversees the state’s SNAP and Medicaid programs along with other emergency aid programs and foster care. 
KFF estimated that West Virginia will lose up to $1 billion per year in health care funding due to changes to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act once it’s fully phased in.
DoHS is likely to take on an additional $18 million a year in new SNAP administration costs as a result of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Allen noted.
“If the state does not step up and fill in that gap, we could see people who rely on SNAP having more trouble accessing customer service or getting help when they need it,” she said.
“The West Virginia Department of Human Services is currently in the process of outlining its FY 2027 budget; however, this process is deliberative, and any program changes will not be communicated until the release of the governor’s budget in January,” said DoHS spokesperson Angelica Hightower. Morrisey will deliver his budget proposal to lawmakers at the start of the legislative session this week in Charleston. 
“All departments are being asked to identify efficiencies in an effort to save taxpayer dollars and ensure we’re addressing the state’s long-term structural budget challenges,” Hightower continued. “The state is not in a position to absorb the significant amount of spending from the federal government, although it will look to make strategic investments where they can be beneficial to our citizens.”
Gailyn Markham, director of communications for the state Health Department, said the agency, which contains public health programs and the Office of Emergency Services, also said any program changes due to budgeting wouldn’t be communicated until Morrisey releases his budget proposal.
Markham emailed the same statement as Hightower.

Education department sees $12M loss in federal funding  
The West Virginia Department of Education saw a more than $12 million reduction in federal funding for the current fiscal year, receiving around $127 million for this year.
“As for [fiscal year 2027], we haven’t heard anything about when we can expect preliminary allocations from [United States Department of Education],” said Elizabeth Younis, manager of the state’s education department’s Office of Elementary and Secondary Education Act, Improvement and Support. 
“I do know that as our enrollment decreases our percentage of the funding will decrease,” she said.
State funding has also decreased for schools as the student population in West Virginia is tied to the state-level funding amount. More than 70 public schools have closed across West Virginia since 2019, and more school closures and consolidations have been proposed this year. 
The education department has submitted flat budget requests for at least the past five years, Younis said. 
“If funds aren’t sufficient, then the program would either look to find ways to operate more efficiently to provide the same level of services or would have to reduce services provided,” Younis said. “As costs have increased over that period, then these programs are shrinking as a result of the inflationary effects which does make it an issue.”
Younis said local education agencies have reserved some previous funding in expectation of the possibility of funding cuts to help continue services for students.  
“LEAs are having more conversations about next year and how to operate within decreased budgets,” she said.
Courts communicating funding needs to Legislature
West Virginia courts receive federal dollars to support some positions and programs but changes in Washington, D.C. aren’t expected to affect their funding.
The Supreme Court has experienced budget pressures, and the judicial branch last year received less funding than it requested from the Legislature while more judicial positions were added across the state. There have been rising public employee insurance costs, and the courts had reported a possible $7 million funding gap in its payroll.
“While we had some preliminary concerns with the initial guidance offered by the State Budget Office, mainly in context and considering the budget cut the judicial branch absorbed in the current fiscal year, we have been working collaboratively toward a fiscally responsible budget plan for fiscal year 2027,” said Jared Hunt, communications director for the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia. 
“We continue to maintain an open and constructive dialogue about our funding needs,” he continued. “We are optimistic that we will be able to work with lawmakers throughout the budget process during the upcoming legislative session to secure the necessary funds that will enable us to efficiently and effectively administer the judicial branch of government.”
Morrisey will deliver his State of the State address on the evening of Jan. 14, which will provide a better look at the governor’s budget priorities. State agencies will have their individual budgets vetted by lawmakers during the legislative session.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookoout) Nearly four years after explosive allegations first surfaced about a Johnson City serial rapist who preyed on women and children without consequence, a civil lawsuit brought by his victims has neared its conclusion.
The man at the center of the allegations, ex-Johnson City businessman Sean Williams, is now serving a 95 year prison sentence, convicted in February of child sex crimes and attempted escape. Williams, 57, faces other drug and sex charges in Tennessee and North Carolina.
But, for years, victims alleged Johnson City Police ignored or mishandled their reports of sexual assault while Williams remained free to prey on other victims. When Williams was finally arrested in 2022 out of state, a search of his electronics yielded images of more than 50 women and young children being sexually assaulted in his downtown Johnson City condo. 
Johnson City officials in February agreed to settle a lawsuit brought by victims for $28 million, the largest legal payout in the northeast Tennessee city’s history. In November, the city approved an additional $2.64 million to settle claims brought by child victims. 
‘A punch in the gut’: women accuse Johnson City officials of victim-blaming in serial rapist case

Then, last week, a federal judge signalled approval for the last portion of the settlement in the case: $4.2 million to be divided among 350 women and minors who reported to Johnson City Police sexual assaults by perpetrators other than Williams between 2018 and 2023. The $4.2 million is a subset of the $28 million approved by Johnson City and will be divided equally among these victims, amounting to about $7,500 each. Lawyers for the original plaintiffs who will share the lion’s share of the $28 million settlement said how it will be distributed remains confidential.
Vanessa Baehr-Jones, an attorney representing victims with California-based Advocates for Survivors of Abuse, said the outcome achieved not just justice, but made victims feel “finally seen.”
“Justice can take many forms,” Baehr-Jones said in an interview with the Lookout. “It can be compensation, which we have here with a class settlement of $4.2 million. It can by system change, institutional change, which we also had here with the city’s agreement of equitable relief and years of monitoring going forward.
“And justice an be found in the process of bringing a lawsuit like this one where survivors are standing up for hundreds of women. The process gave these women a voice. It empowered them and it was inspired to others,” she said.  Other attorneys bringing the case are Brentwood-based Heather Moore Collins with HMC Civil Rights Law and San Francisco attorney Elizabeth Kramer
As part of the settlement, the Johnson City Police Department agreed to four years of monitoring by an independent overseer, which includes detailed audits of 15 sex crime cases each year for the next two years. An outside consultant hired by the city had concluded police failed to collect evidence, interview suspects and witnesses and make arrests in numerous sex assaults reported to them over four years.
Johnson City settles serial rapist class action lawsuit for $28M

“The City Commission approved this settlement with the hope that it would help the victims begin to heal and to rebuild their lives,” a statement released by the city said. 
“It will continue supporting measures that were put in place to ensure that reports of sexual assaults are properly and thoroughly investigated. The City Commission stands behind the Johnson City Police Department and its current leadership,” the statement said.
Two separate lawsuits challenging the police department remain ongoing.
In 2022, former special federal prosecutor Kateri Dahl accused the police department of protecting Williams through incompetence or corruption and forcing her out of her job when she raised questions. Dahl’s lawsuit against the city remains ongoing. 
A third lawsuit filed by an alleged victim of Williams who suffered life-threatening injuries after she said she was pushed out of Williams’ five-story condo during an attempted sexual assault also remains ongoing.
The lawsuit is expected to formally end within weeks after a federal judge requested wording changes to the final settlement, Baehr-Jones said.

Valley City State will be the first North Dakota campus featured on “The College Tour,” a series entering its sixth season. The 27-minute episode is available on Valley City State’s website and will air on the Amazon Prime streaming service starting June 2. 
“I think that this is a great way to showcase some of our students and what they’re doing, and really kind of focus on a lot of the benefits of what VCSU has to offer,” Erin Heide, director for enrollment services at Valley City State. 
The publicity is not free, however. The video production cost the college $92,000. 
Enrollment up nearly 4% at North Dakota public colleges, universities

Mark Potts, director for public relations at the university, said the school had some money designated for marketing that covered the cost. 
“This is a strategic investment to increase the exposure of our university and potentially grow our enrollment. We are anticipating several years of use from the episode,” Pott said in an email. 
The university is able to use smaller segments of the episode and background video in promotions to students across the country. 
Heide said the college recruits students from distant states such as Alaska, Hawaii and Florida.
“Sometimes, when they move into their residence hall in August, that is the first time they step foot on campus,” Heide said. 
She said for those students who have not made an in-person visit, the video tour could provide “more comfort in coming to campus. Maybe they feel like they’re a little bit more familiar with the place before they just have to move all their stuff in and start their new life.” 
Valley City State has seen enrollment rising since the COVID-19 pandemic. The fall 2025 enrollment at 1,827 students marked the third consecutive year of record enrollment.

Alex Boylan, creator and host for the series, said schools featured on the series can see a 5% increase in enrollment and a 2% increase in retention after their episode airs. 
Boylan said the series originated six years ago when his niece was struggling to choose which college to attend. He said the goal is to save families time and money by capturing what a campus is like before families decide to visit or enroll. 
A video crew was on the campus Sept. 8-12. The production crew did interviews with students and recent graduates who had been selected by the university.

Larson said he wanted to highlight the opportunities for students on the campus, like his involvement with shooting sports. 
Larson came to Valley City from Leeds in northeast North Dakota. He said he had a good impression of Valley City State, but wasn’t anticipating that he would enjoy college. “So I kind of wanted to just get in and get my degree and get out as quickly as I could,” Larson said. “But the student clubs and organizations enhanced my experience so much there, and I owe a lot to those organizations for so much professional development, so many friends, so many connections.” 
Anna Palmer is a sophomore from Hebron, majoring in health sciences with hopes of becoming  a dentist, who was chosen for the video.
“One of the main things that I enjoyed talking about was the feel of campus,” Palmer said. “One of the things that really drew me in was that it’s a smaller campus, and it feels more homey.” 
Other segments highlight the music, computer information systems, and fisheries and wildlife programs. 
Boylan, who has produced 200 episodes of “The College Tour,” said he was surprised by the beauty of the Valley City State campus along the Sheyenne River and how well the university and people of Valley City get along. 
“The college has an amazing relationship with the community,” he said.

(Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)A recent federal report again identified Arkansas as the hungriest state, with nearly one in five people on average struggling to afford or access nutritious food over a three year period ending in 2024.
A little over 19% of Arkansans were food insecure between 2022 and 2024 on average, reversing pre-pandemic improvements made by the state, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report released in December. Comparatively, 15% of the state’s residents were food insecure between 2019 and 2021.
People are considered food insecure in the USDA report if they do not have the financial resources or physical access to consistently obtain nutritious food. 
“These numbers represent real families – parents skipping meals so their children can eat, seniors choosing between groceries and medication, and working households struggling to make ends meet,” Sylvia Blain, CEO of the Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance, said in a press release. “No state should hold this ranking year after year.”
Changes coming to Arkansas SNAP program Friday due to Big Beautiful Bill

The percentage of Arkansans who experience food insecurity over the report’s three-year period is higher than the 2024 national average of 13.7%. The number of Americans who are considered food insecure spiked post-pandemic after a decade of sustained improvements, and has yet to decrease again. Arkansas has consistently held a place at or near the top of American food insecurity rankings in recent years.
The number of Arkansans on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program has been decreasing for years, even as food insecurity has risen post-pandemic. The Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance wrote that while the program, originally known as food stamps, are “essential tools” for reducing hunger, more was needed. Better access to food and nutrition education are also necessary.
Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders made childhood food insecurity one of her priorities after taking office in 2023, regularly touting a bipartisan state law passed by the Legislature last year providing free school breakfast to all public school students, regardless of income. 
She has also supported moves by the second Trump administration to implement stricter work requirements for SNAP recipients as well as bans on using food stamps to purchase junk food.
Critics argue such restrictions are overly burdensome, do not address the underlying economic struggles that drive people to need assistance and could result in eligible people losing benefits.

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)From scrambling to fill gaps left by resignations in the Idaho House of Representatives to choosing or rejecting conformity with federal tax code, the legislative session begins on Monday with elevated levels of uncertainty.
The number and complexity of decisions lawmakers will face is head spinning, and all in the context of an estimated $40.3 million deficit this year and as much as $555.3 million next year. 
The issues include Medicaid expansion, tax cuts, lowering the income tax rate to 5%, easing abortion restrictions, training and retaining physicians, potential public school budget cuts, the Idaho Home Learning Academy, the Parental Choice Tax Credit program, mental health services, easing restrictions on offering first aid to minors, alleged abuse of female prisoners, managing public lands, competing needs connected to water, agriculture, energy, transportation, and population growth, workforce, economic, and public safety issues resulting from federal immigration policy, the cost of living, additional social behavior restrictions in state-funded spaces, the presidential primary date, federal involvement in state elections, and money in politics.
The uncertainty lawmakers will confront this year will beget uncertainty across the state, compounded by a federal government replete with surprises. The individual anxiety of prolonged uncertainty is, according to psychologists, among the most insidious stressors human beings experience. As it lingers, individuals enter a state of burnout — emotional, physical, and mental weariness. 
The temptation to check out is strong. 
We cannot. Idahoans willing to fight for our state will engage in one civic act they can control. They will vote in the May primary and again in November with a high degree of confidence that their ballot will be counted accurately. The integrity of Idaho’s elections has received national recognition and statewide praise. If you are an Idaho resident with a current Idaho driver’s license or other government issued ID, registering to vote is easy at VoteIdaho.Gov. Voter ID laws enacted in 2024 have made registering to vote for others more complicated, more time consuming, and often more expensive. The League is in the business of helping people in this group—among them: college students who do not drive, people with disabilities, homebound elderly, residents of care facilities, those who are unhoused, and women who have changed their name because of marriage. For those who face barriers, the clock is ticking to prepare for the May primary. County clerks, the League, and other voter service nonprofits are eager to help.
Even if your side loses in this year’s elections, you will have used a sliver of your time otherwise viewing the news and doom scrolling to accomplish one of the few acts in your control. It will not make watching this legislative session any easier or ease all stress. But it is an important start.

(Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)","Deputy Secretary of State Sandy McMerty speaks in opposition to a bill that would require reporting on the true source of funds backing political campaigns in North Dakota on Jan. 23, 2025. McMerty said her office does not endorse the use of dark money but that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled it is unconstitutional. (Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)A new website allows members of the public to view the financial interest statements of North Dakota political candidates and other elected or appointed officials.
For decades, candidates and some government officials have had to disclose information including their family’s primary source of income, as well as businesses they or their spouse have a financial stake in.
State filings previously were maintained as paper records and could only be accessed by submitting a request to the North Dakota Secretary of State’s Office, which could involve a fee.
Moving forward, the public will be able to download the forms for free online. On the office’s new website, which went live Jan. 1, users can search for filing by name, year, position, agency and other categories.
More financial reporting proposed for North Dakota elected officials

The Legislature directed the Secretary of State’s office to make the filings available online in a law passed last year.
The law, House Bill 1469, also for the first time requires candidates and certain officials to update their statements annually.
The statements were previously only required when someone became a candidate for elected office, or when they were appointed to a position by the governor. 
That meant a lot of the information on file about officials’ financial interests was out of date, said Carol Sawicki, treasurer for the League of Women Voters of North Dakota.
“Things could change — which they usually do — and the public wouldn’t know about it,” said Sawicki, who testified in support of the legislation.
The new deadline for annual filings is Jan. 31 of each year. That means candidates and officials will submit a new batch of statements by the end of this month.
As of Friday afternoon, there were more than 150 filings on the website. The vast majority are for 2026. Deputy Secretary of State Sandra McMerty said that for practical reasons, the Secretary of State’s Office doesn’t plan on digitizing paper-copy statements of interest from past years.
House Bill 1469 also for the first time requires filers to provide the following information:

A list of any local governments or state agencies that the individual or their spouse have provided more than $5,000 worth of goods or services to.
A list of any employer, business or trust in which the individual or their spouse has more than a 10% stake in.

McMerty said the agency has reached out to officials and candidates to notify them of the new requirements, and is hosting trainings to make sure they understand the changes.
Candidates for federal office are exempt from the statement of interest reporting requirements, since they already report this information to the Federal Election Commission.
Sawicki said she hopes the Legislature considers requiring more detailed statements of interest in the future. She suggested that candidates and officials be required to share information about not just spouses, but other relatives as well — like children, parents and siblings.
“Children and parents are very often very closely financially intertwined,” she said.
The launch of the new site coincides with a major upgrade to the Secretary of State’s Office’s campaign finance search tool.
Effort to improve North Dakota campaign finance reporting fails

McMerty said the update allows users to search and analyze campaign finance data in greater detail.
“The general upgrades are really a more user-friendly platform for both the public and those who are required to file,” she said.
City and county candidates and office holders don’t file their information with the Secretary of State’s Office, but with local agencies.
A proposal to change several elements of North Dakota’s campaign finance laws failed at the tail end of the 2025 legislative session.
The bill was partly intended to incentivize more candidates to file on time by increasing late fees and making info about late filers public online.
Lawmakers also debated adding other requirements, including publicizing candidates’ beginning and ending campaign fund balances, and itemized campaign expenditures. North Dakota already makes campaign contributions above $200 public.
Legislators opposed to the additions said they doubted the information would be useful to the public, and feared the changes would discourage North Dakotans from running for office. 
The Secretary of State’s Office is in charge of collecting late fees for officials and candidates that file with its office. Late fees range from $25 to $200.
Those who willfully violate filing requirements could also be subject to a class A misdemeanor.

(Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Federal law enforcement agents served a search warrant at the Smitty’s Supply plant in November, records show, signaling a rare criminal investigation could be underway into last year’s fire and oil spill disaster at a Tangipahoa Parish petroleum products supply plant.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which appears to be leading the inquiry through its Criminal Investigation Division, has so far said little about the search at Smitty’s Supply Inc. in Roseland and initially refused to confirm or deny it took place. Some details were revealed in EPA progress reports the agency’s emergency response team used to document daily actions that took place at the disaster site in Roseland. 
“The CID, with support of the FBI and Louisiana State Police, executed a search warrant for the site,” a progress report entry for Nov. 18 noted. 
It’s unclear what federal agents were targeting in their search. Neither Smitty’s Supply nor the public relations firm it hired to handle communications responded to a request for comment. 
Some recovery operations at the facility to identify hazardous chemicals and products were paused while agents conducted the search, the report stated. The search continued through the next day with an entry for Nov. 19 noting operations to segregate products behind two warehouses “were still paused today during CID activities.” 
After two days of searching, law enforcement agents left the site, allowing the EPA’s response team to continue oversight of the cleanup. On Nov. 20, Smitty’s Supply and its contractors were allowed to resume the work they were doing behind the two warehouses, a report entry stated. 
The Environmental Protection Agency filed its progress reports, which are public records, with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality. The Illuminator obtained them from the department’s public database during an ongoing review of the Smitty’s Supply file, which includes thousands of records.
Spokeswoman Meagan Molter said the state Department of Environmental Quality is not involved in the investigation and directed questions to the EPA. 
EPA spokeswoman Jennah Durant refused to comment on whether a search warrant was executed. The agency refused the Illuminator’s public records request but acknowledged the existence of the warrant in a denial letter from its Office of Criminal Enforcement, Forensics and Training. 
“There is an ongoing regulatory investigation, and the records responsive to your request have been compiled for law enforcement purposes,” the letter stated, citing a Freedom of Information Act exemption that applies strictly to law enforcement records that, if disclosed, could interfere with enforcement proceedings.
Environmental laws are generally enforced through civil actions such as lawsuits or administrative fines. The infractions can lead to criminal investigations, but they are exceptionally rare, said Victor Flatt, a professor and associate director of the Burke Center for Environmental Law at Case Western University in Cleveland.
“Criminal charges are much less common — much, much, much less common — than civil,” Flatt said. “For whatever reason, there’s a possibility there were criminal acts here, and that’s what they’re investigating.”
Environmental criminal cases often arise from either an intentionally bad act or gross negligence on the part of the defendant, such as cutting corners or violating regulations in order to save money and increase profits, Flatt said. Other common elements of environmental criminal cases include the concealing of violations or falsification of records, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. 
Several environmental statutes allow for criminal prosecution, including the Clean Water Act, Toxic Substances Control Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Clean Air Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act.

Defendants can include company employees, executives and even the corporations as individual entities.
“You generally only see criminal charges in the really big cases,” Flatt said.
One of the most notable cases was the 2010 Deepwater Horizon offshore rig explosion, which resulted in the largest oil spill in history. BP, the primary operator of the rig that exploded off the Louisiana coast, pleaded guilty to 14 felony charges, including 11 counts of manslaughter, obstruction of Congress and violations of the Clean Water Act and Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The company was ordered to pay $4 billion in criminal fines and placed on probation for five years, which involved enhanced monitoring and a slate of improvements to eliminate the risk of a similar disaster.   
Transocean Deepwater Inc., which owned the Deepwater Horizon rig and leased it to BP, pleaded guilty to Clean Water Act crimes. The company was ordered to pay $400 million in fines and also placed on five years probation. 
Several BP executives and employees were indicted on related federal charges, but the most serious charges against them were eventually dropped.
The government can be reluctant to prosecute environmental crimes because the burden of proof is much higher than it is for civil offenses, Flatt said. Also, corporations tend to have considerable resources to mount strong defenses, according to a Department of Justice webpage explaining the work of its Environmental Crimes Section. 
“Because these cases routinely involve medium to large corporations, sophisticated white collar crime defense counsel are our usual adversaries, which means that our cases must be airtight,” the page states. 
The EPA and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality are jointly pursuing a civil case against Smitty’s Supply, alleging a long list of violations of the federal Clean Water Act and other federal and state environmental laws for incidents going back nearly five years. The agencies filed their lawsuit Nov. 5 in the federal court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.
It’s possible for the EPA to use a search warrant in connection to a civil case if, for instance, a defendant was preventing access to evidence or a site location. However, Flatt said the search seems more likely to be part of a criminal investigation.  
Smitty’s Supply bottled and manufactured a variety of oils, fluids and other chemicals for distribution to automotive and industrial retailers. Its facility was almost completely destroyed in the Aug. 22 disaster. Storage tanks and drums holding millions of gallons of hazardous substances caught fire, with some exploding. 
Motor oils comprised most of the plant’s inventory, though the government’s lawsuit also noted the presence of other chemicals such as a concentrated form of hydrogen peroxide, which can be highly volatile under certain conditions.  
The fire took two weeks to fully extinguish while oil and chemicals stored at the plant spilled onto both private and public lands and waterways, reaching as far as 47 miles downstream on the Tangipahoa River, according to the EPA. The agency estimates cleanup crews recovered oily waste and petroleum-based materials totaling 11 million gallons, which matches the facility’s storage capacity.
State and federal officials have been unable to determine what started the fire but have discovered numerous violations of laws and environmental regulations they allege could have prevented the disaster or lessened its impact.  
If the EPA concludes its investigation and decides to file criminal charges, the case would then be turned over to the U.S. Department of Justice for prosecution, Flatt said. Those proceedings would be separate from the civil case proceedings.

Aftyn Behn, a Nashville Democrat, turned out Democratic voters -- and possibly Republican ones -- in a December 2025 special election. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Here in a deep red state where elections for federal office are mind-numbingly (and for Democrats demoralizingly) predictable, it was serious political fun—right?—to see Middle Tennessee briefly take center stage in the national spotlight for December’s 7th Congressional District special election. 
A favorable climate for Democratic gains in special elections combined with polling showing a tight race drew scads of outside money on both sides, juicing a campaign ad frenzy the likes of which we don’t usually see in congressional races here. The whole thing had Tennessee Democrats starry-eyed with possibilities.
When the moondust settled the Republican from central casting, Matt Van Epps, took down the activist Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn by 9 points. President Donald Trump won this district in 2024 by 22 points, so Behn’s campaign moved the district 13 points in a blue direction. That’s not nothing though it did lag heftier Democratic overperformance (16-22 points) in the four congressional specials in 2025 in other states. 
Now it’s on to the 2026 midterms, where Van Epps will seek to keep his seat in a regular election. Noting the inroads Behn made and the fact that she finished the campaign with an unspent $465,000 stash in her campaign account, the Nashville Scene’s Eli Motycka wrote last week that Behn “has positioned herself to take another shot at Congress.” In a post-election interview on the Nashville City Cast podcast in December Behn said “We’ll see if I decide to run again next year.” Should she?  
Penning her own campaign post-mortem on Substack in December, Behn sounded triumphalist notes: her single-digit margin (of defeat) “was years in the making,” powered by a door-knocking and voter contact enterprise that operated on a “jaw-dropping scale.” Behn wrote that “our theory of change was affirmed again and again.” As bullet-pointed in the piece that theory revolved tightly around Behn herself: a candidate with a history of turning out their voters (like her, she says), issue ownership (like her on the grocery tax, she says), and a command of grassroots dynamics (like she has, she says). 
In tight Tennessee congressional race, Republican Matt Van Epps pulls out victory

There is a bit of a tinge of “only I alone could pull this off” political vanity to it, which is scarcely more appealing in a populist well-meaning liberal than in the professional narcissist in the White House who regularly traffics in this sort of thing.
Behn justifiably takes credit for improved Democratic margins over 2024 in each of the 14 countries in the district. Importantly, though, the blueward shift Behn pulled off was engineered largely by gains in Davidson County (a 20 point gain over the 2024 presidential margin) with markedly smaller overperformance in the crucial suburban and exurban counties of Montgomery (10 point gain over 2024), Williamson (7 point gain) and Robertson (8 point gain). 
This led some analysts looking at us from the outside in to speculate that liabilities of the candidate herself might put a ceiling on Democratic overperformance in TN-7. NBC’s Steve Kornacki, for example, mused that Behn needed to do a lot better in Montgomery and Williamson to have a chance and wondered “if a Democrat without her baggage could have [made] far more meaningful inroads.” The baggage, of course, is the fodder some of her past actions and comments provided for scorched-earth attack ads.
Behn, it won’t surprise you to learn, flat out rejects the hypothesis that candidate quality explains the loss. Writing on Substack she dismissed what she calls “the delusion that with the right candidate thousands of MAGA or Republican voters would *poof* magically convert to Democrats.” It makes no difference who the Democratic candidate is, she argued, because “the cut-and-paste playbook exploited by the RNC would have been weaponized against any of us.”
Speaking of delusions, this feels half right at best. Yes, mass conversion wasn’t in the offing no matter who ran—a special election is a battle of turnout, not persuasion—and of course Republicans would have aimed their fire at any Democrat, but the weapons would have looked quite a bit different. The Democrats Behn bested in the October primary all came with progressive policy stances similar to Behn, to be sure. But those would have made them look more like run-of-the-mill Democrats, not feed into the AOC-brand far-left identity Behn’s past politically maladroit utterances served up. 
In a turnout race, to state the obvious, it’s about turnout on both sides. Behn rightfully claims credit for a field operation that elevated turnout well above where these special elections typically land—notably higher than the other 2025 congressional specials and actually reaching midterm levels. 
Yet the argument can be made that Behn was a turnout machine on both sides. Republicans spent what they needed to spend down the stretch (which to Behn’s credit was a lot) to make the case to their voters that they need to get off the couch and turn out to make sure the scary commie blonde lady gets nowhere near levers of power. Behn made this a relatively easy case to make. It won’t be any harder next time.

Steve West on the Senate floor. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Isabella Sepahban)FRANKFORT — The legislative session that kicked off last week brings Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher his first opportunity to influence Kentucky’s two-year budget as the state’s top school officer.
High on Fletcher’s priority list is an overhaul of the assessment and accountability systems  that has been in the works since before Fletcher, the former Lawrence County superintendent, became commissioner.
The plan is contained in House Bill 257 introduced last week by Rep. J. T. Payne, R-Henderson, assistant principal of the Henderson County Career and Technical Center.
Fletcher, who in 2024 became the first Kentucky education commissioner to be confirmed by the Senate, has been on the job for less than two years. In a recent interview with the Kentucky Lantern, he  talked about some of what he’s hoping to accomplish in the new year working with the Republican-controlled legislature and Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear. 
School accountability
The local piece is the “most exciting area” of the new accountability model, Fletcher said. Schools would ask their communities what should be expected of graduates and incorporate local feedback into education quality measures.
The Kentucky Department of Education (KDE), which Fletcher oversees, has been working for several years on the new model to measure students’ academic progress following a statewide survey in 2020 and a listening tour in 2021. In addition to local accountability, the model framework directs schools to provide vibrant learning experiences with the communities they serve. 
Fletcher said the new system would focus on measuring individual student growth rather than comparing larger cohorts of students. A news release from the education department says the current system evaluates schools based on the change in accountability indicators from year to year. “In the new system, schools would be evaluated by the academic progress each individual student makes over the course of a year in reading and mathematics.”
KDE would like to work with lawmakers to shorten annual statewide testing after hearing feedback in town halls and introduce an adaptive test for reading and mathematics that would show students’ grade level equivalency and proficiency. After students answer a test question, an adaptive test would then give them another question of a different difficulty level based on if they correctly answered the previous question. 
Teacher pay
Fletcher pointed to a state law going into effect in Tennessee that would make the Volunteer State’s minimum teacher salary $50,000 in 2026. That raises the competition for employees for southern Kentucky school districts along the Tennessee border. 
Fletcher said that “one of the areas that we’re always going to focus on” is raising salaries for Kentucky teachers. Last year, an annual report by the National Education Association ranked Kentucky 42nd in teacher pay, with an average salary of $58,325. 
The same report said Kentucky ranked 48th in starting teacher pay, with an average of $40,161. 
“We want high quality people in front of our kids. We want to make sure that we have the best and brightest, but we also need to compensate them, because we want them to be able to raise a family comfortably,” Fletcher said. “We want to make sure that they have a competitive wage with those around us. That way they want to go into the field and, more importantly, stay in Kentucky.”
Universal Pre-K programs
KDE supports “expanding pre-K opportunities,” Fletcher said. The commissioner is a member of Beshear’s Pre-K for All Advisory Committee, which issued recommendations for gradually introducing universal pre-K programs statewide in recent months. 
Fletcher said he supports a phased approach, as it would allow districts without the necessary facilities and resources at present to prepare to offer universal preschool.
“I do believe that legislators, a vast majority of legislators, would love to have pre-K opportunities for all students. I know our governor would too,” Fletcher said. “The big question is: how do we make that happen in an approach that allows districts to come along?”
Two school districts’ finances
The state’s two largest public school districts — Fayette and Jefferson counties — have faced large budget deficits. Lawmakers have publicly raised concerns about the school districts’ budgets and the topic may come up during the 2026 legislative session. 
Fletcher said that the ways a school district spends its funding are “local decisions” made by superintendents and school boards. Fletcher gave new Jefferson County Superintendent Brian Yearwood credit for reaching out to KDE to ask for help on tackling the deficit. 
As for Fayette, “nothing triggered a management audit or management review for us,” Fletcher said. The district’s budget had more than a 2% contingency fund. If a requirement like that wasn’t met, then KDE could step in with a management review or potentially an audit, Fletcher said. 
DEI
Sen. Lindsey Tichenor is renewing her push to end diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in Kentucky’s public schools. The Oldham County lawmaker filed Senate Bill 26 on the first day of the legislative session. 
In 2025, KDE, as well as 169 of the state’s public school districts, signed a form with the U.S. Department of Education, saying they comply with the Trump administration’s restrictions on DEI in public schools. The form outlined possible consequences for a state or local education agency that protects a DEI program that violates the new federal guidance, including losing federal funding or facing a federal lawsuit.
Asked about Tichenor’s proposal, Fletcher said he believes educators have a moral and legal obligation to “make sure that we’re meeting the needs of all kids” and to help them achieve academically. “The way we approach everything is we want to make sure that every student has opportunity and access.” One way to do that is by looking at data points to identify achievement gaps among populations such as students who qualify for and reduced meals because of low socioeconomic status. 
Fletcher said KDE would never “deny a kid opportunity.”
“As a matter of fact, it’s just the opposite. We want to make sure we have every single kid access and opportunity,” he said. “As far as Sen. Tichenor’s bill, I’d like to see what it looks like, and then we’ll go from there.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DSC_0420-1024x680.jpg,,,2026-01-12 05:58:36.875733

(Middle Susquehanna Riverkeeper photo)A bill aimed at averting another government shutdown this month would divert $500 million for states and tribal governments to repair landscapes damaged by coal mining.
Pennsylvania, with a centuries-long legacy of resource extraction, stands to be the hardest hit by a loss of grant money if the transfer of funds remains in the final version.
House Resolution 6938 passed by a 397-28 vote in the U.S. House and is now in the U.S. Senate for consideration. The money is from the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and would be redirected to wildfire management and National Forest Service operations.
It’s one of three bills in a “minibus” appropriations package for the upcoming fiscal year that congressional Democrats lauded for rejecting the Trump administration “draconian” cuts to a variety of federal programs, including the National Park Service and the Forest Service.

Each of Pennsylvania’s 17 U.S. representatives voted in favor of the bill except for Rep. Scott Perry (R-10th District). His office did not respond to a request for comment.
While the commonwealth is one of more than two dozen states and tribes that received grants last year, Eric Dixon, a researcher at the Ohio River Valley Institute, said coal mining regions in Pennsylvania are most likely to feel the impact.
In 2025, the state  received about $245 million or nearly 34% of the $725 million the U.S. Department of the Interior distributed. If Pennsylvania receives the same proportion of funds in the 2026 fiscal year budget, it would get between $130 million and $175 million less.
The money is used to address hazards from old open pit and underground mines, Dixon said, such as acid drainage polluting rivers and creeks, spoil piles that mar landscapes, and subsidence from subterranean collapses that can endanger homes and businesses. 
“It’s not going to shut the program down, but it is going to be very meaningful for the homeowners who have subsidence or property that’s along a stream that’s not going to get cleaned up now,” he said.
Pennsylvania has the most acres of abandoned and unreclaimed mine lands and most abandoned wells of any state in the nation, according to Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Press Secretary Neil Shader. The bill would also transfer $285 million for an Interior Department fund to stop uncontrolled natural gas emissions from orphan wells.
“Cutting federal funding for these projects will hurt Pennsylvania’s ability to continue its historic work to create jobs and protect public health and safety,” Shader said, noting that IIJA funds paid to cap a majority of the 350 orphan wells under the Shapiro administration. The AML Fund is being used to address 450 abandoned mine sites across the state, he said.
Critics have characterized the transfer as a raid on the trust fund established by the 1977 Surface Mine Reclamation Act, the primary U.S. law regulating the environmental impact of coal mining. It requires mine operators to restore mined land and places a fee on mined coal to fund cleanup work at mines abandoned before the law was passed.
“The Abandoned Mine Land Fund is not a slush fund. It is a promise to communities that built this country and have lived for decades with the environmental damage left behind. Raiding it is unconscionable and an insult to hard-working families across Appalachia,” Patrick McDonnell, president and CEO of the clean energy group PennFuture.
Bobby Hughes executive director of the Eastern PA Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation said Pennsylvania was responsible for about one-third of all coal produced in the United States since it was first mined on an industrial scale in the late 1700s.
As a result, there are 28,000 abandoned mine sites across the commonwealth, 5,500 miles of polluted streams and at least 5,000 sources of acid mine drainage, Hughes said. That’s caused when water inside mines reacts with minerals in the rock, increasing its acidity and causing elements such as iron, aluminum and manganese to leach out.
“These are hazards that we’ve lived with, at least, I’ve lived with them for the last 50 some odd years, growing up here in the Wyoming Valley in the northern anthracite coal fields,” Hughes said.
Hughes’ organization receives AML Fund money to identify and map abandoned mine sites, drainage sources and to restore streams. The loss of those dollars would prevent such work and potentially have a negative impact on efforts to restore, reforest and redevelop them for industry, recreation and tourism.
“To take this kind of money away from … is not really doing any favor to our Appalachian communities that are already still struggling to come back out of the legacy of past minded practices,” Hughes said.
He added the investment in restoring mine land in Pennsylvania has benefits far beyond the commonwealth. The Susquehanna River, which receives mine drainage from northeastern Pennsylvania, is the  Chesapeake Bay’s largest tributary. Hughes, who also sits on the board of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, called it a national treasure.
“What we’re doing up here is cutting down on all kinds of sedimentation loads, coal, silts, metals, organics, phosphorus, nitrogen, that would end up going into the waterways, eventually reaching the bay, if we didn’t do the work we’re doing up here,” he said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Catawissa-Creek-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-12 05:58:36.875733

She  was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent last week in Minneapolis. (Neri/Minnesota Reformer)I’ve been thinking about Renee Good’s dog.
I’ve been thinking about Renee Good’s dog because my heart hurts too much to think about what happened to Renee Good. Her dog in the backseat of her SUV; her dog looking out the rolled-down window at an ICE agent as he walks around her vehicle, filming with his cell phone; her dog, who we later see alive, in a Reuter’s photo, on the icy pavement next to Renee Good’s partner because Renee Good is dead.
Last week was the first week of Kentucky’s General Assembly for 2026. And though nothing much happened outside the filing of bills and adjusting to having no House or Senate galleries for the public, I can’t help but feel dread. Why? Because in addition to lawmakers returning to Frankfort to fight the DEI culture wars, the rolling tsunami of national news — Venezuela, the fifth anniversary of Jan. 6, Renee Good’s execution on an icy Minneapolis street — is drowning us here in the commonwealth, too.
On Friday night, I watched “Comment on Kentucky” like I always do. The conversation sounded so polite. So normal. So like the good old days, distant and sanitized from the 24/7 political dumpster fire we are all, every last one of us, living in.
Ten years ago this month, we bought our house in rural Anderson County. It would be another year and a half before we moved here permanently with our three big dogs, but to a person our neighbors welcomed us from the first day with bonfires and open houses and, “Hey, do you have a minute to walk on over here and meet our new grand baby?” 
We thought we had arrived in paradise. 
We thought we had arrived in paradise because there was proof of that paradise every single day, and then a billionaire playboy from New York City came down an escalator and changed our lives from there all the way to rural Kentucky?
There are no more neighborhood bonfires. There are no more open houses, not even during the holidays. There are no more calls to “walk on over here.” 
It turns out that a decade of poisonous political rancor — Facebook and Twitter sniping, cable TV talking heads and yard signs and Trump flags, the seemingly joyful cruelty of the president, the Kentucky legislature with its addiction to culture wars and embarrassingly obvious envy of the governor, the decimation of local news, the immense chasm we feel between us and neighbors within walking distance — takes its toll. Even the Republicans out here don’t socialize with many of the other Republicans. 
My heart hurts.
I’ve been thinking about Renee Good’s dog. Her big black dog with his white-tipped nose staring out from the back window of her SUV the same way my big dog — Jack, Jack-o’-Lantern, Lantern of Love — with his black snout whitening with age, stares out the back window of my truck, excited for every 10-mile drive to town as if it’s the first time he’s ever been to town. The joy in him.
I found Jack at the Lexington Humane Society as a puppy in November 2017, one year into the MAGA presidency that was, even then, already shifting the tectonic plates of our humanity. 
A few months earlier, I’d put our elderly yellow lab to sleep at the veterinarian’s office, and since I was sobbing they kindly waved me past the reception desk and out the door. Come back another day, they said, you can pay later. 
If you have ever walked out of your vet’s office with just the leash, you understand.
Days later I was back at the vet’s office, standing in line to pay, when the man behind me, his own big elderly dog at his side, said under his breath, “You’re that lady that writes for the paper” and proceeded to tell me what he thought of my politics. He kept on until I turned around and said, “I’m sorry this is taking so long, I put my dog to sleep last week” and suddenly the politics disappeared. How old was my dog, he wanted to know, what happened, boy he was sorry, there’s no friend like a dog, is there?
I was watching “Comment on Kentucky” on Friday night, my dogs asleep on the couch next to me, thinking about universal pre-K and the number of times I’ve sat in Frankfort committee meetings listening to dejected citizens tell the legislature about child care deserts, the prohibitive cost of child care, how common it is for kids to show up in kindergarten not knowing their colors or how to hold a book. And I thought about how this year’s legislature is going to waste our time and our tax dollars, yet again, arguing about DEI. 
They won’t even consider universal pre-K, and it has nothing to do with the budget. Today’s politics are a zero sum game. Our lawmakers can’t give the governor a perceived win, even if it means we all lose.
Ten years ago, when we bought a house in the paradise that was and is rural Kentucky, who could have imagined the massive, deleterious effect a multiply-bankrupt New York City billionaire playboy would have on us, on our neighbors, on our legislature, on our lives.
I’ve been thinking about Renee Good’s dog. How scared he must have been in the backseat of her SUV as she was shot to death at pointblank range by an ICE agent who was filming her — we see this clearly in video — with his cell phone in one hand while drawing his gun with the other. Her SUV smashes into another car and a pole and we hear the ICE agent say, “Fucking bitch.”
I am thinking about Renee Good and her loved ones and her children and her community. 
I am thinking about her blood on the airbag, her six-year old who will never see his mother again, her dog in the backseat.
Renee Good was not shot to death because she did anything wrong.
Renee Good was shot to death because this is where a decade of 24/7 hateful, dehumanizing political rhetoric leads; because the leaders we elected to represent us in our statehouse and the U.S. Capitol have allowed the president they either worship or are terrified of deploy masked gunmen into our streets to terrorize American citizens in states that he lost.
Renee Good was shot to death by a member of the president’s personal police force, filming his actions for the president’s entertainment.
I am thinking about Renee Good’s dog because my heart hurts too much to think so directly about the totality of her death.
I bet Renee Good loved her dog.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MG_2737-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-12 05:58:36.875733

Steve Pearce has been nominated to lead the Bureau of Land Management. (Courtesy NMPBS) The Bureau of Land Management oversees 8.3 million acres of public land in Colorado, including some of our most iconic landscapes, from the volcanic tuff spires of Penitente Canyon to the alpine basins of the San Juans.
The agency’s director has enormous authority to set the priorities for these lands, whether it be conservation, recreation, mining, grazing or renewable energy development. It’s a job that shapes the beloved landscapes in our state and sets the stage for what future generations may inherit.
That’s why Steve Pearce’s nomination to lead the BLM should alarm every Coloradan who values the freedom our public lands provide.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Pearce has spent decades championing the sale of the very lands he now wants to manage. He co-sponsored the HEARD Act, which would have forced the sale of federal lands to state and local governments that, in his words, “we do not even need,” falsely claiming it would pay off the deficit. These weren’t offhand comments — they reflect a worldview that sees our public lands not as national treasures but as disposable assets.
Pearce has targeted the laws that safeguard Colorado’s wildest places, too. He attacked the Antiquities Act — the same law that empowered President Barack Obama to designate Browns Canyon National Monument in 2015, conserving world-class whitewater, wildlife habitat and cultural artifacts in the heart of Colorado. Pearce also co-sponsored legislation to strip presidents of the power to designate new monuments and cheered President Donald Trump’s 2017 review to shrink or eliminate existing ones.
In his home state of New Mexico, Pearce fought against the creation of Organ Mountains–Desert Peaks National Monument, despite broad public support and clear economic benefits, and later urged a 92% reduction. With such a hostile record, his confirmation could further put our beloved national monuments at risk.
In Colorado, the stakes are enormous. Our public lands aren’t just scenic backdrops, they’re our competitive advantage, helping to sustain a $62.5 billion outdoor recreation economy and support 1 in 8 Coloradan jobs. Access to world-class skiing, climbing, trail running, hunting and angling opportunities is core to attracting businesses and talent to our state. Colorado needs a BLM director who prioritizes recreation and conservation if our outdoor industry is to continue thriving.
Pearce’s conflicts of interest raise serious red flags. While in Congress, he owned two oilfield equipment companies and reported earning hundreds of thousands from them annually — not to mention the millions in campaign contributions from oil and gas interests he accepted. It’s no surprise his legislative record reads like a fossil fuel industry wish list including bills to exempt drilling from environmental review and fast-track permits.
Colorado has worked hard to strike a balance between energy development, agriculture, recreation and conservation on our public lands. We’ve shown that “multiple use” doesn’t mean “extraction only.” But Pearce’s approach is lopsided: His record shows little regard for protecting wildlife corridors, preserving backcountry access or ensuring our waterways stay clean.
Even more troubling, he’s praised efforts to confront and undermine federal land managers, including encouraging counties to “take control” of public lands and threatening federal employees. This type of rhetoric is dangerous. It not only undermines the trust and collaboration our communities depend on to manage wildfire and drought; it places a target on federal employees and on future generations’ freedom to access and enjoy public lands like we do.
Fortunately, Colorado has two U.S. senators who are strong supporters of keeping our public lands public. Sen. John Hickenlooper, a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that will debate Pearce’s nomination, came out swinging in opposition, saying, “Americans deserve a BLM director who will be a true steward of the millions of acres under the agency’s care. Steve Pearce is NOT that person.” Sen. Michael Bennet, also opposing Pearce, added, “Pearce’s views on public lands are completely out of touch with Colorado’s values.”
Thank you, Sens. Bennet and Hickenlooper, for your early and strong opposition. We need continued leadership to rally senators from both sides of the aisle to oppose Pearce’s nomination. Our public lands — which are a shared inheritance for all Americans — deserve a true steward, not someone who views them as inventory to be liquidated.
Colorado’s future depends on it.

Anyone wishing to nominate a book can email kate@ribook.org.


Mother Rita offers a scold: “Don’t act like D.C. is someplace special … I’m just as busy as you, and I still find time to read nearly fifty books a year.”
While 50 tomes may be a tall order for most, the Rhode Island Center for the Book is encouraging Ocean State residents to read at least one this year. The nonprofit center at Salve Regina University chose “Happy Land” as its 2026 selection for Reading Across Rhode Island (RARI), a statewide initiative that takes the concept of a book club and widens interest in a particular book to people all over Rhode Island.
A kickoff event where readers can learn about the book and get a free copy is scheduled for Friday, Jan. 24, from 2 to 4 p.m. at the Rhode Island State House. Donations covered the cost of 80 copies of the hardcover book that will be given away. A separate author event with Perkins-Valdez is scheduled for April 14, with details and registration to arrive sometime in March at ribook.org. 
Released in April 2025 and due out in paperback in March, “Happy Land” follows Nikki on her trek to a place “where neighbors are too far to be heard and the worst threat to mammals is the crack of a rifle.” Summoned unexpectedly by Mother Rita, Nikki discovers more about her family, as well as a dispute which threatens her grandmother’s comfort and security. Simultaneously, the reader tags along with Nikki’s 19th-century ancestor Luella, a freedwoman who helps create an independent Black kingdom in the Reconstruction era. 
Reading Across Rhode Island began in 2003, in response to the somber mood after 9/11, with librarians, educators and readers working together each year to choose “a single inspiring book as a basis to engage in a statewide dialogue,” said Kate Lentz, the Center for the Book’s director.
An associate professor of literature at American University, Perkins-Valdez has published four books since 2011. Her first book “Wench” fictionalized the lives of four enslaved women and was chosen for a citywide reading initiative in Santa Monica, California, while her own homebase of Washington, D.C. has also selected “Happy Land” for a citywide read in February. She said she’s thrilled each time it happens, because it means more libraries will hold her books, making them “so much more accessible to people to check it out.” 
The public can nominate books for each year’s Reading Across Rhode Island title, and a selection committee reviews the options before making a final choice. Perkins-Valdez’s book beat out three other finalists this year, and impressed community readers like Samely Rosario, a Classical High School student who was among those reviewing the nominations.   
A self-described “slow reader,” Rosario said in a statement shared by the Center for the Book that she was first lured in by the book’s “beautiful” cover art. The reasonable chapter lengths, Rosario said, more readily invited her to get invested in what she found to be a compelling narrative.  
“I honestly didn’t expect to like it as much as I did. It was so emotional and powerful in ways I didn’t see coming,” Rosario said. “And not even gonna lie, it actually brought me out of a reading slump. I hadn’t been excited to read in a while, but this story reminded me why I love books.”
Scanned pages from a National Archives publication show ‘slave schedules’ from Georgia recorded during the 1860 Federal Census. These documents were used in the 1850 census as well and listed enslaved people by descriptors like age and sex, often removing their names while listing those of their enslavers. (National Archives via Archive.org)
The draw of historical fiction
Another reason Perkins-Valdez likes community-wide reading challenges: “It reaches people in the community who may not typically read historical fiction,” she said.
Perkins-Valdez’s entire oeuvre is this genre she sees as a window into the past and its vastness, and a way for people to access stories they might otherwise miss. When she reads historical fiction, Perkins-Valdez said, she hopes to learn something, leaving with the impression, ‘‘Wow, I didn’t know that.”
“Happy Land” is Perkins-Valdez’s “love letter to the hills of North Carolina, to the people who live in the Appalachian Mountains,” she said, adding that the book is really for “anybody that lives in any kind of small community with an extraordinary story.”
“Because I think a lot of the most extraordinary stories don’t come from the major cities,” Perkins-Valdez said.
A banjo first led Perkins-Valdez up the mountain road to what would become “Happy Land.” 
In late 2021, like many people looking for a hobby during the pandemic, Perkins-Valdez was learning to play the instrument. A search for historical banjo players from western North Carolina routed Perkins-Valdez toward a rabbit hole that ended in a newspaper article: a story about a “reclusive community that named a king and a queen and called themselves royalty,” she said. 
Known as the Kingdom of Happy Land, it was a community of once-enslaved people who settled near the North and South Carolina border after the Civil War. “I thought, ‘Is this true or not?’ I wasn’t sure if it was true,” Perkins-Valdez recalled.










Not even gonna lie, it actually brought me out of a reading slump. I hadn’t been excited to read in a while, but this story reminded me why I love books.


– Samely Rosario, a Classical High School student who reviewed “Happy Land” and other nominations for the 2026 Reading Across Rhode Island book 


So she reached out to a librarian named Ronnie Pepper at the Henderson County Public Library in Hendersonville, North Carolina, who confirmed the tale. Perkins-Valdez collaborated and shared resources with Pepper over telephone until 2022, when she made her first in-person trip to Hendersonville. There she worked with Pepper and Suzanne Hale, both members of the local Black History Research Committee pushing publicly for the Kingdom to persist in memory. 
The real Kingdom ultimately molded the one crafted in Perkins-Valdez’s book, and Nikki’s research process to find her ancestor echoed her author’s. One scene in the novel has Nikki poring over Federal Slave Schedules in the local library. The not-so-neutral records prove a traumatizing thing for Nikki, who sees her ancestors reduced to line items and rendered not as humans but as property. 
“Maybe this is why a lot of Black people don’t know our history,” Nikki narrates. “Just the search requires fortitude.”
It’s a process Perkins-Valdez herself navigates with a mix of sensitivity and toughness. She said she has not researched her own family history in any thorough way.
“It’s very emotionally difficult to look through it for African Americans, because some of that history can be quite dark,” Perkins-Valdez said. “When I’m researching this about other people, I can put a little bit more emotional distance than if I were researching my own family.”

Haas/Library of Congress, Historic American Engineering Record)
To migrate or not to migrate
Perkins-Valdez’s more immediate family did, however, inform parts of the emotional terrain in “Happy Land” — specifically, the distance between migrating children and their parents. Perkins-Valdez distilled this theme via Nikki’s mother, whose decision to move away from the mountains carves a multi-generational rift with her own mother Rita.
“There’s something real there in terms of the relationship between the migrant and the person who didn’t migrate,” Perkins-Valdez said.
The author’s back-and-forth with her own mother is much gentler and lacks the tension of the family fictionalized in the book, she said, but shades of bittersweetness remain.  
“One of the things that I tapped into with Nikki was, I’m from Memphis, and I moved away, and I was the only of my siblings to move away, and to this day, my mother asks me, ‘When am I coming back?’ It breaks her heart.”
Her mother still sends an occasional Memphis job posting. Perkins-Valdez counters that her retired mom could always move closer to her daughter.
“I still hold Memphis close to my heart, but so many of my friends who migrated away will say, I’ll never move back,” Perkins-Valdez said. “I do think there’s a feeling of the people who stayed home that we kind of left them behind. …I‘ve made a whole life here in D.C.”
She’s more of a reader than Nikki, but not any less busy in her personal and professional life. Books require a measure of devotion to materialize, and Perkins-Valdez said she’s improved over the years at “how to get the work done in the face of a busy life,” such as 25-minute writing sprints just to get something down.
Organizing the daily stuff is not necessarily easier. Perkins-Valdez referenced an interview with Aretha Franklin: “They asked her what was the hardest thing about being a traveling superstar singer. And she said ‘figuring out what’s for dinner.’ I felt that.”    
But Perkins-Valdez does know the flavor she seeks from a piece of prose. She said she sometimes asks herself of her students’ most memorable works, “Why do I remember, out of the hundreds of stories I read, why are there some that stay with me for years?” 
Perkins-Valdez argued those lasting impressions come from writers who “access that part of yourself that a lot of people don’t want to access.”
“As a writer, that is what I’m trying to capture,” she continued. “I’m trying to capture something that sticks with the reader, that kind of sticks to the ribs, as we say in the South.”

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)When the Virginia General Assembly gavels in Wednesday, lawmakers will face one of the most consequential and politically unusual sessions in years, with a new Democratic trifecta, four major constitutional amendments nearing the ballot, and a fresh biennial budget colliding with fiscal uncertainty and early maneuvering for the 2026 midterms.
Democrats enter this year’s session in control of the governorship, House of Delegates and state Senate for the first time since 2021, after Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger’s November victory. They hold a narrow 21-19 majority in the Senate and a commanding 64-36 edge in the House of Delegates, positioning the party to advance much of its agenda with a governor ready to sign it.
At the top of the docket are four proposed amendments to the Virginia Constitution that, if approved again by both chambers in the coming weeks, would go before voters statewide later this year. 
They would protect abortion access, enshrine same-sex marriage, automatically restore voting rights to felons who have completed their sentences and allow a rare mid-decade redistricting ahead of the 2026 congressional elections. 
The session will also set the stage for negotiations over a new $212 billion biennial state budget, introduced last month by outgoing Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, that will likely see significant changes as it moves through the Democratic-controlled body.
“This is not a normal opening act for a legislative session,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington. “Spanberger is setting the stage for an aggressive year one.”
The four constitutional amendments loom large because the governor has no formal role in approving or vetoing them. Each has already cleared the legislature once and must pass again before heading to the ballot.
Two — the same-sex marriage and voting rights amendments — advanced last session with bipartisan support, reflecting a political shift on issues that once divided the chambers sharply. 
The proposed abortion amendment, by contrast, drew opposition from every Republican lawmaker, after years in which GOP leaders explored abortion limits or near-total bans. 
Democrats have argued the measure is necessary to lock in protections as Virginia remains the least restrictive state on abortion in the South.
The redistricting amendment is perhaps the most controversial. 
It would permit lawmakers to redraw congressional lines mid-decade, a move prompted by President Donald Trump urging Republican-led states to gerrymander in their favor ahead of the 2026 midterms, with Democratic states signaling they may respond in kind. Critics warn it could further politicize redistricting, while supporters say it is a defensive necessity.
The state budget may also be a sticking point. 
Youngkin’s proposed two-year spending plan includes tax relief and spending increases but landed just as federal policy shifts threaten to squeeze state finances. Recent federal legislation — including the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill — reduced support for health care programs, raising questions about how much Virginia will backfill lost dollars.
“Overhanging everything that the Democratic trifecta wants to do is a significant fiscal challenge,” Farnsworth said. He warned that cuts to Medicaid and Affordable Care Act subsidies could hit rural hospitals especially hard. 
Spanberger’s early cabinet appointments suggest a pragmatic approach, Farnsworth said, pulling from both the legislature and prior Democratic administrations. 
“The choices suggest a ratification of her campaign’s strategy of being a more moderate Democrat,” he said, adding that could frustrate some progressive activists. 
Republicans, now firmly in the minority, will have limited leverage but still have a role to play. Farnsworth sees potential bipartisan cooperation on health care impacts in Southside and Southwest Virginia and on statewide data center policy.
As debates unfold over taxes, education funding, energy infrastructure and reproductive rights, Farnsworth said one theme will cut across nearly every issue.
“The success of the next governor’s agenda will depend to a significant degree on the key campaign promise of affordability.”
Some of the proposals that The Mercury will be tracking in the next 60 days: 
 Cannabis

Adult-use cannabis retail is poised to come to Virginia this year after Spanberger pledged to sign legislation creating a regulated market, reversing repeated vetoes by Youngkin. 
The proposal, still being finalized, would establish a statewide retail licensing system, prioritize small and independent businesses, eliminate local opt-out provisions and strengthen testing, zoning and public safety requirements, setting the stage for legal sales to begin later in 2026.
House Bill 26, sponsored by Del. Rozia Henson, D-Woodbridge, would create a process for people convicted of certain marijuana-related felonies before July 1, 2021 to receive an automatic court hearing to consider modifying their sentences. 
The bill would apply to individuals who remain incarcerated or on community supervision as of July 1, 2026, and would sunset July 1, 2029. A companion bill has been filed in the Senate.
 Child care

As 88% of Virginia employers report worker lateness or absences due to child care shortages, with high costs and limited access hurting hiring and retention, lawmakers are expected to file new child care bills this month.
Sen. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg, introduced Senate Bill 3 to create an Employee Child Care Assistance Program that would provide state matching funds to employers helping cover workers’ child care costs. Del. Adele McClure, D-Arlington, is carrying a similar proposal across the hall, House Bill 18.
Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, has also filed SB 20 to expand eligibility for Virginia’s Child Care Subsidy Program by raising income limits.
 Data centers

With more than 500 data centers now operating across Virginia, lawmakers will grapple with how the facilities are powered and who bears the cost. Proposals under consideration would increase oversight of high-load customers, primarily data centers. 
House Bill 155, carried by Del. Josh Thomas, D-Prince William, would require State Corporation Commission review and approval before such customers are connected to the grid, and lawmakers are also debating whether data center operators should more directly fund generation projects or transmission lines.
Environmental groups are also pressing for changes to Virginia’s data center tax incentive. 
While most lawmakers remain reluctant to repeal the incentive, which forgoes nearly $1 billion a year in revenue, some are considering adding requirements companies must meet to qualify.
 Education

For years, local governments have said they need more revenue to support their school divisions, but proposals to create new local taxes have drawn opposition from Republicans, including Youngkin.
Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, has reintroduced Senate Bill 66, which would allow localities to levy an additional local sales and use tax of up to 1% for public school capital projects, subject to voter approval.
Lawmakers are also advancing proposals aimed at supporting teachers and school staff. 
Democratic Virginia Beach Del. Michael Feggans’ House Bill 31 would create a supplemental pay program for experienced, fully licensed teachers working in schools with persistent vacancies.  SB 61, sponsored by Sen. Tammy Mulchi, R-Mecklenberg, would offer financial incentives to school psychologists who earn national certification and expand eligibility under an existing state program. 
Both proposals would require funding approval, though cost estimates have not yet been released.
House Education Committee Chair Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, is also carrying HB 92, which would update school staffing ratios for teachers, librarians and counselors.
Several bills address student well-being and access to services. 
Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, has filed Senate Bills 33 and 39 to expand allowable supports for at-risk students and study how schools can better use technology to support student safety and mental health.
Sen. Danica Roem, D-Manassas, has reintroduced Senate Bills 4 and 42 to expand access to school meals and address meal debt. SB 4 and its companion, HB 96, would make school breakfast free for all students, while SB 42 aims to prevent penalties tied to unpaid meal balances.
Lawmakers will also consider changes to student assessment and classroom rules. SB 16, filed by Sen. David Suetterlein, R-Roanoke County, would extend a temporary option allowing alternate assessments, while HB 36 by Del. Joshua Cole, D-Fredericksburg, would allow larger sixth-grade ensemble music classes.
In higher education, Feggans’ HB 56 would expand eligibility for free tuition under the Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program, with costs falling to institutions. 
As of Jan. 3, no bills had been filed to change how governors appoint members to governing boards at Virginia’s public colleges and universities, a flashpoint in the state’s higher education landscape for much of last year, culminating in a court battle between lawmakers and Youngki’s administration. Spanberger is expected to fill multiple vacancies after taking office Jan. 17.
 Elections and voting

Lawmakers have filed several election-related bills aimed at campaign finance transparency, voting rights and election administration.
House Bill 44, sponsored by Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, would require the Department of Elections to create a searchable, sortable public interface for campaign finance reports, allowing users to filter, export and analyze data on candidates, committees, contributors and spending. 
Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, is carrying two key measures. 
Senate Bill 34 would clarify that a finding of incapacity in guardianship or conservatorship proceedings does not automatically disqualify a person from voting, requiring a specific court finding that the individual lacks the capacity to understand the act of voting. 
Favola’s SB 58 would extend the deadline for receiving absentee ballots and related materials from noon to 5 p.m. on the third day after an election.
Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, introduced SB 52, which would expand the 90-day “quiet period” for voter list maintenance to all primary and general elections and extend timelines for registrars and voters responding to cancellation notices. 
A House companion, HB 28, has also been filed.
Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, filed SB 76 to move all primaries in presidential election years to the presidential primary date, allow earlier collection of petition signatures and adjust campaign finance deadlines accordingly.
HB 51, sponsored by Del. Rob Bloxom, R-Accomack, would allow some localities to reverse recent moves to November elections and return to holding local elections in May, potentially resulting in multiple election dates in a single year.
 Energy

Spanberger has made energy efficiency and affordability central to her first legislative session, including plans to rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and restore funding for weatherization projects.
If those funds return to the Resilient Virginia Revolving Fund, bills such as House Bill 214 would support local flood resiliency grants.
Spanberger is also backing expanded solar and energy storage. Legislation reintroduced by Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, would revise the Virginia Clean Economy Act to increase utility energy storage requirements and ease regulatory barriers. 
Other proposals she supports would give the State Corporation Commission more authority to review grid efficiency and limit unnecessary transmission line construction.
 Environment

Concerns about PFAS, or “forever chemicals,” contaminating Virginia waterways are prompting new legislative attention. 
Lawmakers are considering measures to require testing of biosolids used as fertilizer, a known pathway for PFAS contamination. Senate Bill 138 would require PFAS testing at wastewater treatment facilities and could lead to limits on allowable levels.
Debate over menhaden, a key forage fish, will also be revived, as environmental groups again call for a Chesapeake Bay–specific population study amid concerns about low fish numbers and broader ecosystem impacts.
Separately, Virginia has signed a renewed Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement, committing the state to pollution reduction benchmarks, expanded education efforts and continued funding to help farmers reduce runoff into the bay.
 Guns

As they did in 2020, Democrats are using their control of state government to advance a new slate of gun control legislation this session.
House Bill 217, re-introduced by Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, would ban the importation, sale, manufacture, purchase and transfer of assault firearms and large-capacity ammunition feeding devices, with limited exceptions. 
Violations would be Class 1 misdemeanors, with convictions triggering a three-year ban on firearm possession. The bill would also prohibit anyone under 21 from possessing or transferring an assault firearm.
Sen. Jennifer Carroll Foy, D-Prince William, sponsored Senate Bill 27 to establish standards of responsible conduct for firearm industry members, requiring safeguards to prevent unlawful sales and misuse. 
The bill would allow civil enforcement actions by the attorney general, local prosecutors or injured individuals.
Favola filed SB 38 to tighten firearm transfer rules for people subject to protective orders or convicted of domestic assault, adding age, residency and reporting requirements to ensure firearms are relinquished.
HB 106, sponsored by Del. Jason Ballard, R-Giles, would lower fees charged by local law enforcement for processing concealed handgun permit applications.
 Health care

A right-to-contraception bill vetoed last year is back as House Bill 6. 
Republicans had argued they might have supported the measure if it more closely resembled a Tennessee law that acknowledges a right to contraception without creating a legal entitlement. Virginia’s version passed the legislature but was vetoed by Youngkin.
Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, who is again carrying the bill, has said it would protect access to contraception if federal protections are rolled back. The proposal is also part of a broader debate occurring alongside a constitutional amendment to protect abortion rights.
Lawmakers will also again consider legislation to create a Prescription Drug Affordability Board. Bills carried by Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, and Del. Karrie Delaney, D-Fairfax, would establish a panel to analyze data and set payment limits on prescription drugs in state-sponsored health plans.
The proposal passed last year with bipartisan support, but was vetoed by Youngkin, who called it “noble in its intent” but raised concerns about medical innovation. 
Separately, lawmakers are revisiting concerns about outdated technology used by social service workers administering SNAP and Medicaid benefits. Feggans is carrying HB 66 to spur system upgrades as agencies prepare for increased workloads tied to recent federal changes.
 Housing

Housing bills vetoed by Youngkin last year could see a different outcome this session, as Spanberger has signaled support for policies aimed at housing affordability, stability and supply.
Among the measures already filed is House Bill 15, which would extend the grace period for late rent payments from five to 14 days, delaying when landlords can move to terminate a lease. 
HB 4 would allow local governments to establish a first right of refusal to purchase publicly funded affordable housing developments when affordability restrictions expire.
Lawmakers are also expected to revive proposals allowing faith-based organizations to build housing on land they own, an effort that failed last year but mirrors legislation introduced in Congress by U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va.
VanValkenburg said he plans to reintroduce bills encouraging housing along certain commercial corridors and urging local governments to address affordable housing shortages — proposals that previously drew resistance over state versus local authority.
 Taxes

Republican lawmakers have introduced several tax-related proposals this session, though it remains unclear if they will advance with Democrats controlling both chambers and the governor’s office.
House Bill 12, sponsored by Del. Joe McNamara, R-Roanoke County, would permanently extend Virginia’s higher standard deduction, setting it at $8,750 for single filers and $17,500 for married couples filing jointly. Under current law, those amounts are scheduled to drop sharply after the 2026 tax year.
McNamara is also carrying HB 13, which would eliminate the remaining 1% local sales tax on groceries and essential personal hygiene products beginning July 1. To offset the loss, the bill would require the state to reimburse cities and counties monthly for the forgone revenue.
Del. Tim Griffin, R-Bedford, has filed House Joint Resolution 14, a proposed constitutional amendment that would exempt one personally owned, noncommercial motor vehicle from state and local personal property taxes. 
The exemption would apply only to automobiles, motorcycles and pickup trucks and would take effect only for vehicles acquired after the amendment is approved.
Griffin is also sponsoring HJ 15, which would direct the Department of Taxation to study the potential impact of repealing Virginia’s individual income tax. The study would examine broader tax reforms needed to replace that revenue and report findings to lawmakers by the start of the 2027 session.
 Transportation

Transportation funding and safety are once again on the General Assembly’s agenda, with lawmakers eyeing long-term support for public transit and expanded traffic enforcement.
No bills have been filed yet, but a legislative subcommittee has discussed dedicating Virginia’s share of $460 million in new capital funding for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority starting in fiscal 2028, alongside Maryland and Washington, D.C., to stabilize service and support long-term investments.
Among the transportation measures already filed is Roem’s Senate Bill 41, to allow voluntary donations for highway safety improvements during online license or registration renewals. 
Sen. Jennifer Carroll Foy, D-Prince William, reintroduced SB 31 to require two qualified workers on freight trains, with a House companion carried by Del. Bonita Anthony, D-Norfolk.
Lawmakers have also filed multiple bills expanding automated traffic enforcement and updating who can certify speed camera violations, including Senate Bills 81, 84 and 59. 
Other proposals would allow single rear license plates and eliminate certain vehicle registration fees for disabled veterans or their unremarried surviving spouses.
 Workforce development

Strengthening Virginia’s workforce and bolstering the worker pipeline is top of mind for legislators this year. 
Sen. David Suetterlein, R-Roanoke County, introduced Senate Bill 10, which would allow 16- and 17-year-olds to participate in certain work programs if they are enrolled in registered apprenticeships or state-approved training programs, or hold required certifications or licenses.
Workforce development has long been a focus in Richmond, and Spanberger outlined plans last fall to strengthen career pathways, increase community college funding and better prepare students for emerging technologies.
More workforce-related proposals are expected as the session unfolds. 
 Measures on minimum wage, FOIA, child abuse, recalling delegates

Lawmakers have filed a mix of labor, transparency and social policy bills that often reflect sharp partisan divides.
Senate Bill 1, sponsored by Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, would raise Virginia’s minimum wage in stages to $15 an hour by Jan. 1, 2028. The bill would codify the $12.77 hourly wage set to take effect in 2026, raise it to $13.75 in 2027 and index future increases to inflation starting in 2029.
Roem introduced SB 56 to limit how much public bodies can charge for responding to records requests under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act. 
The bill would cap fees based on employee pay rates, clarify notice requirements and streamline court procedures when agencies seek more time or relief from fee limits.
House Bill 158, sponsored by Griffin, would expand the legal definition of child abuse or neglect to include cases in which a parent or guardian attempts to transition a child to a sex or gender other than the child’s “biological sex.”
Del. Lee Ware, R-Powhatan, filed HB 8, which would set rules for selecting and overseeing Virginia delegates to a potential constitutional convention under Article V of the U.S. Constitution. 
The bill would allow lawmakers to recall delegates, require them to follow legislative instructions, and impose criminal penalties for exceeding their authority.

(Mechelle Hankerson/Virginia Mercury)A resolution on how the state measures students’ performance in history and social science was delayed for two months during the Board of Education’s business meeting on Thursday, giving Virginia and social studies leaders time to reach a compromise.
Measuring student success helps address a number of factors, including ensuring students are meeting state academic standards, informing curriculum and improvements to teaching and learning, and encouraging critical thinking and civic knowledge, all of which align with the State Board of Education’s months-long discussions and accountability changes.

 Board Change

On Thursday, the board elected board member Mashea Ashton as board president to succeed Grace Creasey, who resigned in December before her  term was set to expire in June 2026.

However, the problem facing the board is determining how much flexibility social studies leaders will have once the combined subject of history and social science is added to the state’s Consolidated State Plan, the recognized accountability system, and ultimately approved by the board and the U.S. Department of Education. 
“We’re not opposed to accountability, but we want the option for performance assessments because it is what is better for students and more reflective of what our discipline goes in our defense, what historians do,” Danyael Graham, Virginia Social Studies Leaders Consortium president, said in an interview last week. “Historians don’t sit there and answer multiple-choice or select-response questions about all their historical knowledge. They’re developing arguments. They’re using evidence.”
In addition to expanding opportunities for students and incorporating JROTC leadership courses into the state plan, the board is considering adding U.S. History or Civics to the state accountability system for the 2027-28 school year. Virginia is preparing the update following last year’s redesign of the plan.
The federal government requires states to assess students only in math, reading, and science.
A January study published by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission found that the proposal could face challenges due to the current scarcity of qualified instructors and the logistical difficulty of fitting extra classes into existing schedules. 
Board member Beth Ackerman said at the board’s meeting last week that what makes her “nervous” about adding social studies to the accountability system is hearing concerns from the social studies community and from special education, “because they will also need significant time” to prepare new assessments. 
She said the board must consider requirements if the subject of history and social studies becomes an alternate assessment for students with significant cognitive disabilities. 
Given these concerns, Ackerman suggested, “Maybe we move forward and exclude social studies for now, but I really feel like we should yield to some of the concerns we’re hearing around social studies.”
Vice President Bill Hansen opposed the idea.
“I hear your concerns, and I appreciate them, and we’ll take them into account … but I just think we’ve got to proceed with what we have and get the input from folks,” Hansen said.

Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, who is also a teacher, threw his support behind adding history and social science to the accountability system into a letter shared with the board last summer. Recognizing this, the letter argued that although Virginia is “stronger than many other states in emphasizing social studies education,” the subject has still been “deprioritized” in recent years.
Todd Truitt, a parent who spoke at Thursday’s meeting, said he, too, supports the ESSA amendment, citing the value of standardized tests for ensuring schools teach essential historical knowledge and support educational equity. 
“Opposition to content-based standardized exams often rests on the assumption that critical thinking skills transfer independently of knowledge, yet cognitive science consistently shows that thinking is domain-specific and driven by the content students know, making these exams one of the few reliable ways to verify whether schools have taught this essential knowledge,” Truitt said.
Social studies leaders have advocated for flexible, performance-based local assessments. These allow schools to measure student learning in meaningful, varied ways, while maintaining alignment with state standards. Such assessments balance accountability with recognition that students learn and demonstrate knowledge differently.
Neely Minton, president-elect of the Virginia Social Studies Leaders Consortium, said the group supports accountability but argued that the amendment conflicts with last year’s approved House Bill 1957, which she said allows for local alternative assessments instead of standardized Standards of Learning tests.
Minton and other social studies leaders are concerned that moving the subject into the state’s accountability system will provide less flexibility and potentially rely on an older testing method that emphasizes rote memorization.
Virginia social studies leaders warn proposed testing shift could sideline critical thinking

“Returning to rote instruction and selected response testing will not solve the literacy crisis that we’re in; it will make it worse,” Minton said.
Since November, interest in local alternative assessments in history and social science has grown, sparking further dialogue between the state education agency and social studies leaders across the commonwealth.
Graham said she has been pleased to see the agency’s engagement on the subject, clarifying that history and social science courses differ from math because their progression is not “linear” and course sequencing varies. 
She maintained on Thursday that existing “rigorous, equitable, and scalable” assessment systems should be prioritized and called for greater transparency and collaboration in the amendment process.
“We want it done right,” Graham said in an interview. “If (history and social science) are in there, let’s take our time. Let’s do it right. Let’s not rush it just to say we got it in the ESSA Consolidated Plan.”
The board delayed any action to amend changes to the state accountability plan until March, when it meets for its work session and business meeting on March 25 and 26.

(Photo by Angela Breck for Maryland Matters)A multi-year attempt to create a Prescription Drug Affordability Board in Virginia will face a new test in 2026. 
The bipartisan proposal would create a special board of medical and health experts tasked with analyzing data to set payment limits on drug prices. Virginia would become the 12th state to have such a board if the law were to pass, but the concept is still novel and has drawn skepticism from a diverse range of opponents, including outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin.
When Youngkin vetoed the bill last year he called it “noble in intent” but suggested it could hinder medical innovation or discourage certain pharmaceutical companies from putting down stakes in the state. 
Other opponents, typically pharmaceutical manufacturing lobbyists or trade associations, have pointed to how Maryland’s PDAB has taken years to be fully operational after becoming the first state in the country to establish one in 2020. 
Virginia AARP Freedom Virginia — an affordability-focused advocacy group — have backed Virginia’s PDAB proposal each year and touted its potential as a key factor in reducing drug prices. Meanwhile, life sciences trade group Virginia Bio director John Newby called PDABs an “unproven experiment,” in a statement celebrating Youngkin’s veto last year.  
Late in 2025, however, Colorado’s PDAB became the first state to approve a cap on a drug. 
By capping the cost of a medication called Enbrel, which is used to treat autoimmune diseases, starting next year a ceiling will exist for how much a patient or insurer in the state has to pay for it. That vote had been years in the making and staved off a previous legal challenge. 
While the news of Colorado’s board setting a cap could spell success, the matter continues to be litigated. 
The board has most recently been sued for the second time by the company that manufactures Enbrel, with its first hearing supposed to happen this month — a full year before the price cap would kick in. 
The previous suit, filed when the board was still deliberating a cap on Enbrel, was dropped because the plaintiffs were not able to prove the board would cause damages. 
And Maryland, Virginia’s neighbor to the north, is another state with a PDAB catching national attention. 
As the first state to kick off PDABs nationwide, Maryland has served as an example of timely innovation as prescription drug prices have surged as well as a cautionary tale for states seeking a speedy solution, due to the time it’s taken to get off the ground. 
The stalled journey, however, was due to various factors. After passing legislation to create it in 2019, the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic spurred then-Gov. Larry Hogan to pull the board’s earmarked funding and not assign board members. 
When current Gov. Wes Moore started to get the ball rolling again by releasing those funds, the board then took a year and a half to set up a regulatory framework before settling on six drugs to consider for cost reduction. But the matter is not a done deal yet.
Maryland Matters reporter Danielle Brown, who has covered the state’s PDAB in recent years, noted thatColorado’s action “is pretty encouraging for a lot of the supporters.”
But she said opponents are “seeing this five-year lapse (in Maryland taking action) as kind of a sign that this is a lot of time, a lot of money that may not yield much in terms of out-of-pocket costs for consumers.”
But the savings to consumers is “yet to be seen,” she added, and can be a test for Maryland and other states that have enacted or are considering creating boards.  
Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger is still cautiously monitoring PDABs nationwide as a proposal here could make its way to her desk. 
The matter was absent from her health care affordability platform and she did not endorse the idea on the campaign trail. 
“I want to make sure that whatever we might implement in the future will be a best practice based on the successes or challenges that other states have faced,” she told The Mercury last year when asked what she thought about the PDAB proposal. 
When reached last week about the subject, her staff indicated the sentiment from last summer’s comment remains the same.
Still, state lawmakers plan to try again on their PDAB proposal in this year’s legislative session. Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, and Del. Karrie Delaney, D-Fairfax, will carry the bills again. 
“The problem is that the concept is just beginning to show progress in other states,” Deeds said, acknowledging some people’s skepticism.
But that progress also signals how the model can work.
Deeds said this year’s version of the bill could have a specific focus on drugs to treat rare diseases — for which medications can sometimes be most costly. Ultimately, Deeds hopes that Virginia’s PDAB, if it becomes a reality, can be successful and provide relief. 
“I want a bill that’s going to work and bring down costs. I think (Spanberger) does too,” he said.

Advocacy groups are laying out policies they want to see garner lawmakers’ support and the governor’s signature, with many familiar bills that failed in recent years.
With a hefty Democratic majority in the House of Delegates and a slimmer Democratic hold in the Senate, several bills that had previously been vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin that will make a return. Gov.-Elect Abigail Spanberger has already outlined multiple measures aimed at efficiency programs and reducing the need for transmission line buildouts that she plans to support.
The Commission of Electric Utility Regulation (CEUR), a group made up of legislators and citizen members, have presented a slate of legislative recommendations after months of public hearings that have gained support from various groups. Here are the key proposals.
 Affordability

The voters of Virginia spoke loud and clear last fall: making life more affordable is their priority concern. The commission suggests that there be more transparency around potential energy efficiencies and involuntary service disconnections through monthly reports to the State Corporation Commission. It also suggests extending the 2038 commitments for the companies to fund programs for low-income households.
Legislation from Sen. Kannan Srinivasan, D-Loudoun, also aims to urge the utilities to aid low-income households with upgrades to help reduce their power usage. The major companies already have programs in place to help homeowners get access to grants and other funds for efficiency upgrades.
 Regulation reform

Clean Virginia, a powerful clean energy lobbying group, is pushing lawmakers to pass utility regulation reforms. Some of the tweaks they recommend include directing the SCC to create a group to design performance-based regulations for utilities that they say would control costs and lessen vulnerability. The group plans to deliver recommendations for future legislation.
CEUR also recommends changing how utilities file their biannual integrated resource plans. The IRPs are what the utilities use to show their long-range projections on power usage from their customers and what power generation projects will be needed in order to retain grid reliability. There have been some debates over how the utilities calculate what customer bills could look like in the future and the SCC has ordered the companies to show two different methods of those calculations.
The commission wants to take a closer look at how the companies are calculating their projected load growth and how to ensure the numbers are accurate as data centers proliferate across the commonwealth. 
 Data centers

The ongoing debate around data centers centers on the tremendous amount of power they use, and how to ensure they are paying a fair share of the power generation. 
A recent rate case for Dominion Energy was seen as “a step in the right direction” by the Southern Environmental Law Center. The case created a new rate class for high load customers and locked them into 14-year contracts to make sure they pay for the energy they are projected to need, even if the projects don’t come to fruition or may not stay online for more than a few years.
Clean Virginia is recommending additional oversight, proposing the SCC review and create an approval process for large load users over 25 megawatts before they can get hooked up to the grid. The group said there needs to be more consideration of how adding these power-hungry facilities will have an impact on ratepayer’s bills and the energy infrastructure that would be needed to sustain grid reliability.
Along those lines, a bill filed by Del. Lee Ware, R-Powhatan, suggests that the SCC consider large load customers  voluntarily financing energy technologies as a way to speed up their connections. Another proposed bill from Del. Josh Thomas, D-Prince William, recommends the SCC having a review process for high load users over 25 MW to ensure the state has the infrastructure to meet their power needs. 
Lawmakers will also have to consider if they wish to keep or alter the current tax incentive for these users. There has been discussion of tightening the requirements for companies to meet in order to be eligible for the tax breaks. 
 Environment

On the environmental policy side, there are moves to expand the state’s efforts to reduce pollution that ends up in waterways. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation has laid out their priorities, which include maintaining funds for the agricultural cost share program that helps farmers implement best practices that reduce sediment and other pollutants from escaping their properties.
Despite signs pointing towards a tighter budget process this year, CBF also is urging the state to invest in the Community Flood Preparedness Fund as well as the Stormswater Local Assistance Fund. The group stresses how important it is to help coastal communities become more resilient against rising flood waters.
There is also a push by lawmakers and environmental groups to urge the Department of Environmental Quality to take a closer look at the source of forever chemicals ending up in rivers and streams. 
The General Assembly 2026 legislative session begins this Wednesday, Jan. 14.

What does that mean?
The Gold Dome. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
The yearly legislative session is when the representatives and senators Georgians elect pass new laws, so the Capitol will be buzzing for the next three months with politicians and lobbyists trying to make deals and get their priorities into law.
The session lasts 40 days, but not all in a row. Sometimes lawmakers take days off or set aside days just for committee meetings. One of the lawmakers’ first priorities will be to set a schedule for the year, and leaders from both chambers got a jumpstart on that when they released a proposed calendar Sunday.
Under the proposed schedule, lawmakers will eagerly wrap up their work on Thursday, April 2.
Georgia law prevents lawmakers from raising money for their campaigns during the session – the idea is to prevent even the appearance of pay-for-play politics.
And 2026 is set to be a seismic election year with Republican Gov. Brian Kemp term-limited from running again. This future vacancy at the top has caused a cascade effect of politicians running for higher office, especially in the state Senate.
Lawmakers who are not planning to upgrade their title are also under pressure because the entire House and Senate will be up for re-election in November.
A busy first day at the Capitol
Advocacy groups such as the ACLU of Georgia have planned events to kick off the first day of session. Alongside partner organizations like Indivisible Georgia Coalition, representatives from the ACLU of Georgia will hold training sessions, provide an update of ongoing court cases and preview their legislative priorities for the upcoming session.
Christopher Bruce. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“Georgians are telling legislators we need to emphasize people over politics, and that’s going to be the message that happens at the Capitol,” said Christopher Bruce, who works as the ACLU of Georgia’s policy and advocacy director.
Over 600 people have signed up to attend the “Pack the Capitol” event hosted by the ACLU and other advocacy groups, he added.
Faith leaders from different traditions will also be among the groups gathering at the Capitol Monday as the session kicks off. The event, which will include speeches and a group singing of “God Bless America,” is organized by First Five Freedoms and aims to promote civility and empathy.
Pastor Randy Rainwater with Grace New Hope Church in Lawrenceville will be among the faith leaders there to pray for state lawmakers.
“As a pastor, as someone who cares about people both in my congregation and out of my congregation, the wellbeing of us as Georgia citizens and as Americans depends so much on our unity,” Rainwater said. “And that’s what made us a nation. It’s what’s allowed us to survive for now 250 years. If we’re not a civil people, this doesn’t work.”
Can much be accomplished?
Rep. Michelle Au. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
With so many sitting lawmakers seeking higher office this year, there’s debate over whether much will be accomplished in the next few months.
And the dim prospects of a productive session can be frustrating for those who plan to walk into their respective chamber Monday with policy goals in mind.
For Rep. Michelle Au, the start of session represents a chance to put into action the plans she’s been developing since lawmakers adjourned last year. She likened returning to the Gold Dome for the start of the session to the excitement of going back to camp after time away, even as she acknowledged the election-year constraints that will likely limit how much gets done.
“I do think it’s going to be, in my mind, the more annoying confluence of having the inability to get a lot of stuff accomplished along with a lot of performance art and posturing and electioneering,” said Au, a Johns Creek Democrat and anesthesiologist who takes leave from her job during the session.
“So, there’s going to be more talking taking more time with less output,” she added.
House Speaker Jon Burns, a Newington Republican, speaks to reporters ahead of the 2026 legislative session. Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder
Speaking to reporters in the Capitol on Wednesday, House Speaker Jon Burns said he believes “meaningful legislation” can still be passed.
“There are a lot of things being said about how this session may not be productive,” he said. “I don’t agree. I think our job is to come here and perform, do our jobs, and I believe we’re going to pass meaningful legislation this session.
Burns said his top priority for the year will be to pass legislation aimed at boosting Georgia’s literacy rate, citing statistics showing that only a third of students read at a proficient level by the time they finish third grade.
With Georgians struggling to deal with rising costs of living, and with Democratic flips of a state House seat and two seats on the state board overseeing utility costs underscoring the importance of the economy on the minds of voters, the word “affordability” is likely to pass the lips of many a lawmaker in speeches this year.
Sen. Max Burns. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Senate Republicans want to help make life more affordable by reducing and eventually eliminating the state income tax by 2032, while Burns said the House will introduce a plan to cut property taxes. Details on both plans, including how the state and local governments can compensate for revenue losses, have yet to be publicly revealed.
Sen. Max Burns, a Sylvania Republican and chair of the Senate Higher Education Committee, said Republicans will be eyeing ways to make getting a degree in Georgia more affordable as well.
That could include creating needs-based financial aid for college students for the first time, Burns said or reducing the time it takes to graduate.
The average time it takes to earn a degree varies between University System of Georgia schools with an average of about four years and nine months system-wide. Georgia Tech students graduate the quickest on average at about four years and two months. Atlanta Metropolitan College has the longest average time to degree completion at six years and eight months.
“If we look at the challenge of affordability, it’s not necessarily the cost of tuition or the direct cost of education, it’s the ancillary costs that are really driving that, especially the cost of living and some of the fee structures,” he said. “But if we can compress graduation by a semester or two, then what you do is you really reduce the cost of education.”
Republicans control both chambers and the governor’s mansion, so what they say typically goes, though Democrats can try to wield some influence, especially when there is disagreement in the GOP ranks.
Sam Park. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
House Minority Whip Sam Park of Lawrenceville said that Democrats in the House will be focused on ensuring that every Georgia resident can afford necessities like child care, health care and housing.
“Health care, housing and education will be our areas of focus in which we’re really looking at affordability,” he said.
However, Park also said he is worried about Republican-led tax cuts and the potential reemergence of social issues dominating the Legislature during a year full of high-profile elections.
“Especially with my Republican colleagues, it seems that they’re very much focused on seeing who can out-MAGA each other, which I think is ultimately to the detriment of Georgians who are really struggling with this affordability crisis,” Park said.
Back from the dead
The Legislature runs on a two-year cycle, which means that bills that were introduced but not passed last year could be revived this year.
Some significant bills that could be roused from their slumber include:

A ban on puberty-blocking drugs for transgender minors which was dialed back in a House committee
A bill preventing state workers or their dependants from receiving gender-affirming care through the state health plan
A ban on diversity, equity and inclusion policies in schools and colleges that was grafted onto a bill dealing with sick days for teachers after it did not pass the Senate ahead of a legislative deadline
Duelling plans to deal with traffic cameras in school zones, either by putting new regulations on them or getting rid of them altogether.
A push to make hand-marked paper ballots the primary voting system across the state
A bill preventing political campaigns from knowingly publishing certain audio or AI-made materials within 90 days of an election.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)My smile at work was only a mask for the pain and fear I was carrying in my body. I am not new to the scourge, devastation, and loss of gun violence — but this was different. Very different. A cold-blooded murderer was on the loose in Providence, Rhode Island — my city.
After shooting and killing two students at Brown University and injuring nine others on Dec. 13, law enforcement — local, state and federal agents — frankly, no one knew where or who the shooter was.
I watched and listened intently to every press conference and news report about the manhunt, but the uncertainty — the where, the how, the when was deeply unsettling.
Brown University president announces trauma recovery initiative for campus community

It was Monday morning, the first school day after the horrific shooting. I woke up at 3 a.m., listening to my own breath and wondering. I quickly wrote an email to my assistant principal letting him know that I would not be able to stand at the door to welcome students. This was new for me. My role as a greeter sets the tone for the entire school day.
“I just woke up to the news that they released the person of interest detained in the horrific Brown University tragedy,” I wrote. “As a gun-violence survivor with a personal history of loss, I am not emotionally able to perform my door duties this morning. I went to bed feeling a sense of safety, but this news has left me unsettled and fearful.”
My assistant principal responded quickly — with care, thoughtfulness, and grace.
Throughout the week, administration and front office staff implicitly checked in on me. I felt seen and cared for in a way that made me feel safe — and in a way that allowed me to teach and care for my students.
As a teacher, my job is to show up for work, protect my students, remain calm, maintain routines, and teach — all while holding fear, courage, and resistance in my body. On the surface, this may seem easy. In reality, it is a herculean task.
I had no idea how good I was at masking my own feelings. I’ve always said I wear my emotions on my sleeve. Not this time. No one could see the pain and fear I was holding. I smiled. I attended meetings. I stayed busy regulating my own emotions while helping my sixth- and seventh-grade students regulate theirs, just days before school vacation. This is the quiet, unseen emotional labor of educators like me.










As a teacher, my job is to show up for work, protect my students, remain calm, maintain routines, and teach — all while holding fear, courage, and resistance in my body. On the surface, this may seem easy. In reality, it is a herculean task.


I thought about the students in Providence who were once on my class roster and whom we lost to gun violence. I remembered their names, their smiles and whispered prayers for them and their families. I thought of the Brown University students who were killed or injured. I whispered prayers for them, too — and for us. 
Yes, we have strong protocols in my school district. Yes, I have participated in countless active shooter drills, worked on gun violence prevention  policies as a former state legislator. But being a gun-violence survivor teaches vigilance.
Knowing that a cold-blooded murderer was targeting an educational institution in my city and that no one knew where he was — was nerve-wracking. As a teacher, I had to perform normalcy and predictability while carrying the weight of personal loss.
In quiet moments, I was not only responding to my own fear, but to the very real possibility that an active shooter could breach the doors of my school. With fear in my heart and courage in my mind, I was ready to protect my students with my body if I had to. I was ready.
I made it through four difficult school days not on my own. I made it through because my students kept me grounded — too young to fully absorb the gravity of the news cycle, still laughing, still learning.
My students are my heroes. They are the reason I show up — even in moments when I didn’t think I could.
For my fellow educators: If you are holding fear, grief, or memories in your body while still showing up for your students,  know this—you are not weak, and you are not alone.
Give yourself permission to pause, to ask for support, and to be human. Holding space for students does not mean abandoning yourself. Your presence matters—but so does your healing.

Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George's and Anne Arundel) discussing the upcoming 2026 legislative session. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Maryland House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) begins her first session leading the 141-member chamber Wednesday looking to balance a budget with a $1.5 billion deficit, provide affordable health care and protect immigrants.
All of it, she says, will be achieved against a backdrop of civility.
“We’re not Washington, D.C. We’re going to act appropriately. We’re going to make sure that we have civility, that we have decency and that we have respect,” Peña-Melnyk said during a recent interview in her Annapolis office.
“Those are things that you make a choice, that you have to be intentional about. I demand it, and I expect it. I set the example,” she said.
That doesn’t mean there won’t be tough discussions and decisions, particularly on the budget, where she does not expect tax increases to be part of any soluion. Part of the budget review process, she said, will be assessing where to make cuts and having the discipline to keep from spending on new programs the state can’t currently afford.
“We have to make sure that we take care of the programs that we have right now,” Peña-Melnyk said. “Maryland is required, unlike the federal government, to have a balanced budget. We will adjourn with a balanced budget.”
Another task will be assessing how the expansive tax and spending cuts package, the so-called One, Bg Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed into law July 4, will affect Maryland. Among other changes, the legislation Pena-Melnyk called the “big, awful bill,” increases state tax exemptions on federal returns, makes deep cuts to health care spending and bans Medicaid funding from health care providers “primarily engaged in family planning services, reproductive health, and related medical care.”
Maryland lost 25,000 federal jobs in 2025, latest data show

But Peña-Melnyk also understands the necessity of having a relationship with the federal government, noting that Maryland had the highest number of federal job losses in the nation last year at about 25,000.
“That impacts the bottom line,” she said. “So, as we look at this session, I’m going to be looking at everything through the angle of affordability, accountability and opportunity.”
“We’re going to make sure that we give relief to people that are struggling. For example, to pay their electric bill. That are struggling to be to put food on the table,” she said. “I am a balanced person, a respectful person, and we deal with very tough issues, but we’re going to find solutions.”
In terms of immigration policy, Peña-Melnyk supports the reintroduction of legislation to ban 287(g) agreements, which allow local police to perform certain immigration enforcement roles. She served as a co-sponsor last year of legislation sponsored by Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s), but the Senate stripped out the language blocking such agreements when it passed the so-called Maryland Values Act on the final day of the 2025 session.
Since then, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) has said he supports the bill, giving supporters new hope.
“I think it’s important, especially given the climate that we have presently in this country,” said Peña-Melnyk, a native of the Dominican Republic. “The states have to act. This is a way for us to tell our immigrant community, ‘We love you. You’re part of us. We see you. We hear you, and we want to give you protection,’ and that’s why this is important.”
As part of her agenda to focus on the “energy crisis,” Peña-Melnyk said there will be legislation to prevent utility companies from using ratepayer dollars on executive bonuses.
The legislature took aim at utility spending last year through the Next Generation Energy Act, an expansive bill that Gov. Wes Moore (D) signed into law in May. It bans investor-owned electric and gas companies from using ratepayer dollars to fund trade association memberships and private planes.










We’re going to make sure that we give relief to people that are struggling. For example, to pay their electric bill. That are struggling to be to put food on the table. I am a balanced person, a respectful person, and we deal with very tough issues, but we’re going to find solutions.


– House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George's and Anne Arundel, on on some of her goals for the session


“So many people are not able to afford to pay their energy bill. They’re struggling, and we have to make sure that we give them relief this session,” Peña-Melnyk said. The bill proposes “to make sure that bonuses that the CEOs get doesn’t come from the ratepayers. That’s one of our priorities.”
Some help
Some of the solutions this session, she said, will come from House standing committees.
“I have good people on these committees that bring experiences like I do [and] that work really hard like I do…. Do the homework like I do, and they care about their constituents like I do,” Peña-Melnyk said. “Do we have all the answers? No, but are we willing to roll our sleeves and work like crazy? Absolutely.”
The new speaker has already made several changes, including splitting the former House Health and Government Operations Committee into Health Committee, chaired by Del. Heather Bagnall (D-Anne Arundel), and a separate Labor, Elections and Government Committee, chaired by Del. Melissa Wells (D-Baltimore City).
Dels. J. Sandy Bartlett (D-Anne Arundel) and Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery), who served as vice chairs of the Judiciary and Ways and Means committees, respectively, have been elevated to chairs of those committees.
Del. Kris Valderrama (D-Prince George’s), who was elected to the House in 2006, the same year as Peña-Melnyk, will chair the Economic Matters Committee.
In 2026, affordable housing is needed ‘now more than ever,’ but getting there is the challenge

“I’m honored and humbled. I don’t pretend to know everything. I want to do my best and I want to work with the members,” Valderrama said Friday. “My number one thing in being in Annapolis is constituent services. Policy comes second to me. We are there to make policy, but I’m there to represent my constituents to the best that I can.”
‘Sense of responsibility’
As Peña-Melnyk sat on the dark leather chair inside her office, she tapped the arm rests and paid homage to former House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County), who was the first woman and first person of color ever elected to the position.
“She was a transformative leader when it came to education, addressing health disparities and affordability … she did so much,” Peña-Melnyk said. “It’s such a responsibility to make sure that I honor her legacy, but that I build on that. It’s important that she sat right here, and that I have to continue that work. It’s something that I respect and do not take lightly.”
Peña-Melnyk, who became the second woman to become speaker but the first Afro-Latina when she was elected Dec. 16, called it a “sense of responsibility.”
“It is such an enormous responsibility, not just for Afro-Latinos, Blacks, for everyone,” she said. “To be the leader of 141 people, to be someone that has to guide the House in a respectful way, and when we adjourn to make sure that we deliver for the people. That is how I see it.”
Her family was able to see her stand at the rostrum and lead the House chamber during the special session where she was elected last month. Once it was over, her family left and she stayed in Annapolis.
“They had lunch without me because I told them to go. I had a lot of work to do,” she said. “My family is used to it.”

Then, the gas ran out.
New natural gas connections in several municipalities throughout the region are paused, according to officials and developers. Liberty Utilities, the regulated company that serves as the region’s gas supplier, says it lacks the capacity to add more customers without upgrades that could take years, and millions of dollars, to realize. 
Local officials said the situation was an unexpected roadblock that threatened development they had worked hard to court under the assumption that gas service would be available to new homes and businesses.
“We found out the hard way,” said Pat Consentino, a member of the Tilton Select Board for nearly two decades and the town’s current land use coordinator. Within the last year, she said, plans for nearly 400 residences had been approved in the town. “We have a tremendous amount of development going on right now … but people, the developers, are going to the utilities and not getting gas.”
Municipalities in the lakes region including Franklin, Gilford, Laconia, Northfield, and Tilton are facing a pause on new connections, according to David Chunn, planning and zoning director for the city of Franklin. A spokesperson for Liberty declined to clarify which municipalities were affected when asked via email Jan. 6. However, at a meeting of the Tilton Select Board on Dec. 4, Liberty engineer Ian Crabtree said demand in the area was at the upper limit of what the company could supply with existing infrastructure.
The line that supplies the Lakes Region was originally constructed in the 1960s. Shortly after, the area’s population grew rapidly throughout the 1970s and ‘80s, Crabtree said. In the early 2000s, anticipating a capacity shortfall, the company began widening the line, but the project was never completed. Today, a stretch of about 10 miles of the original six-inch line remains.
Liberty’s preferred next step would be widening that stretch to a modern 12-inch line, Crabtree said, but that would be a “huge undertaking.” Representatives at the meeting estimated it could take upwards of five to seven years to complete the work.

The company operates the station as a supplement to the region’s strained gas network, which is linked to Concord with a line originally constructed in the 1960s. Even with the plant running near constantly in the winter and the pipeline transmitting as much gas as it can, the region is facing a capacity shortfall, Liberty representatives said at a meeting of the Tilton Select Board in December. (Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)
Where gas network does exist, access is not guaranteed
Natural gas service is somewhat uncommon in New Hampshire. About 1 in 5 households uses the fuel for home heating, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2023 American Community Survey. 
That’s because most of the state lacks natural gas infrastructure, said Don Kreis, New Hampshire’s consumer advocate. But the municipalities saying they’ve been hit with a moratorium do have access, falling within Liberty’s “franchise area,” or the region in which the utility can operate. The capacity shortfall, then, means the utility has “customers it can’t serve,” Kreis said.
It wasn’t the lack of gas that was the biggest problem in Franklin, Chunn said, but rather the lack of warning.
“The lack of capacity is a bummer, understandably,” he said. “My irritation is that it was allowed to get to this point, and it was known about many, many years in advance, and no notice was shared with anyone, as far as municipalities. … Many of us only learned about this through people coming to tell us about it, homeowners and property developers, as they encountered the issue. It would have been nice to know about this in advance, from the state regulators.”
Kreis said planning to ensure a utility can meet customer demand was the responsibility of the utility, not the state.
“It’s convenient to blame the government for having failed to plan, but it’s the utility’s job to plan and execute,” he said. 
And planning and executing a project as extensive as a pipeline expansion to the Lakes Region, he added, would be a significant investment.
“Liberty is a cash-strapped company. … They have limited capital resources, and they’re only willing to spend so much building facilities like pipelines.”
A tentative step toward expansion
In a Jan. 7 email, Liberty Utilities spokesperson Pamela Bellings said the company had begun the “design and engineering” phase for the next upgrade project, though she did not specify what that would entail.
Engineering, design, and permitting alone would likely take years, Crabtree said at the Dec. 4 meeting.
Liberty lawyer Mike Sheehan added then that simply planning the project was not the only hurdle. Another “limiting factor,” he said, would be whether such growth would be considered justified.
The cost of projects undertaken by utilities is distributed across all ratepayers in a system. In deciding whether to incur the cost of this project — which would affect rates for customers across the state, not just in the Lakes Region — the Public Utilities Commission and Liberty would have to consider whether such an investment is justified, Sheehan said. 
“That’s always the push-pull we have,” he said. 
During the meeting, Crabtree estimated such a project would cost in the “tens of millions.”
The land abutting the former Laconia State School and surrounding buildings is slated to be redeveloped in a project called “Laconia Village,” featuring about 2,000 housing units. City Planning Director Rob Mora said he is worried the units will become excessively expensive if the development cannot use natural gas as heat, but a pause on new gas connections in the Lakes Region could prevent those units from accessing the network.

Assessing options
Though the project would take years, local officials said they still believed it was important. Rob Mora, planning director for the city of Laconia, said that without more gas, the Lakes Region lacked the infrastructure to support the state’s goal of boosting the housing supply.
Mora said he worried higher costs of alternative fuels would raise local development out of the reach of those who need it most. 
“Especially if you’re trying to build larger-scale, you know, residential development, that’s really going to be for that ‘missing middle’ income bracket or that workforce development, those are going to be the people that are affected most by this, and those developments that are supporting those people,” he said. 
Mora pointed to the planned development of about 2,000 homes and adjacent commercial spaces at the site of the former Laconia State School, and said he worried costs would increase for future residents without natural gas. 
But as fully electrified development becomes more common, disregarding alternatives to gas heating might be a missed opportunity, said Sam Evans-Brown, executive director of Clean Energy New Hampshire. 
Given the long time frame for gas expansion, adapting both residential and industrial development plans to electricity instead of gas could be both faster and cost effective if done right, he said. 
“I would encourage them to get a lot more creative than just thinking, hey, how do we pressure Liberty to build more natural gas? Because even if that’s the solution they want, it’s going to take years, and I do think there’s been an enormous amount of innovation on the industrial electrification side of things.”
Electricity is expensive in New Hampshire, Evans-Brown said. But investing in a more efficient building envelope and heat pumps can bring down the cost, making an electrified building more feasible. 
New Hampshire’s first net-zero multifamily building was constructed in West Lebanon in 2019, with 29 units of housing for low-income individuals and families — all climate-controlled with electric heat pumps. 
“I disagree with the assessment that gas is the only way,” Evans-Brown said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Tilton-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-12 05:12:33.303759

More than 280 people in central Ohio were detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in one week last month, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. 
The arrests were made Dec. 16-21 during Operation Buckeye, which ICE launched in Dec. 16.
Ohio Immigrant Alliance reported last month that at least 214 people were arrested and were in detention as of Dec. 24. Ninety-three percent were men and 80% appear to be Latino, according to a report from the Ohio Immigrant Alliance. They said the actual number is likely higher.

“(ICE is) not here to make Columbus better,” Ohio Immigrant Alliance Executive Director Lynn Tramonte said in a statement last month. “They are bringing violence. When Columbus leaders said ICE makes our communities less safe, that is exactly what they meant.”
An ICE officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis on Wednesday. Good was a U.S. citizen who, according to reports, was operating as a “legal observer.” 
“We said ICE brings violence to our communities, and this is exactly what we meant,” Tramonte said in a statement Wednesday.
ICE did not respond to questions sent by the Ohio Capital Journal, but listed ten people who had been detained in the Columbus area with criminal charges through Operation Buckeye in a news release. 
The homeland security department listed eight people who had been detained with criminal backgrounds. 
“We operate in Ohio every day, but we recently surged our resources there under Operation Buckeye,” ICE Director Todd M. Lyons said in a statement. “Since Jan. 20, we’ve arrested drug traffickers, spousal abusers, thieves and worse.”
However, it’s unclear how many people ICE has detained have a criminal background.  
“The facts really bear out that who they’re picking up are people with no criminal records,” said Angela Plummer, executive director of Community Refugee & Immigration Services. 
Maqueli Eldredge, a paralegal at Legal Immigration Services in Dublin, said there are typically a few ICE reports every day, but there were more than 19 reports on Dec. 16.
“ICE has always been here in Columbus, but we’ve never seen anything like that,” she said. 
Legal Immigration Services in Dublin began realizing an ICE operation was underway when calls started coming in from people saying their husbands never came home or their their spouse’s car was found abandoned, Eldredge said.
One of their clients was detained in Dublin when ICE officers pulled her over, she said. 
“They don’t have any probable cause to pull over someone just because you have brown skin,” said Walter Messenger, a lawyer at Legal Immigration Services. “It’s just ridiculous that people have to go through this.”

ICE took a break over Christmas and New Year’s, but have started detaining people in the Columbus area again, Eldredge said. There were three ICE reports on Monday last week and five on Tuesday, she said.
“They’re still here,” Eldredge said. “They’re still detaining people. We have clients being very afraid of going to their ICE visits and getting detained. But if they don’t go, they are considered absconder.”
Some of their clients have stopped sending their children to school, she said. 
“They cannot go pick up the kids at school, or they’re afraid they’re just gonna take their kids,” Eldredge said. “It’s a tragedy. I don’t know how we’re gonna make it.”
Lack of space in detention centers became a problem for ICE last month, Plummer said. 
“The practicalities became a problem because there wasn’t enough place to put people they were detaining,” she said.
There are six Ohio detention facilities that contract with ICE to hold people who have been detained: Butler County Jail in Hamilton, the Seneca County Jail in Tiffin, the Geauga County Safety Center in Chardon, the Corrections Center of Northwest Ohio in Stryker, the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center in Youngstown, and the Mahoning County Justice Center in Youngstown.
Of those who were detained in Operation Buckeye, 137 were taken to the Butler County Jail, 61 went to the Corrections Center of Northwest Ohio, 10 went to the Seneca County Jail, three went to the Mahoning County Justice Center, one went to the Calhoun County Jail in Michigan, one went to the Hamilton County Jail, and one went to the Miami Valley Jail, according to an analysis by the Ohio Immigrant Alliance. 
Eldredge said their clients who are being detained at Butler County Jail say it’s overcrowded. 
“They cry,” she said. “They say there’s no food, too many people in the same cell.”
A few Ohio Democratic lawmakers sent a letter this week to the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections Director Annette Chambers-Smith asking the department to make sure there are safe conditions for people detained by ICE at Butler County Jail. 
There were 1,044 people in Butler County Jail as of Thursday. The general housing capacity for Butler County Jail is 844, even though ODRC recommends 756 as the housing capacity, according to a July ODRC inspection report.  
“This continued practice of exceeding safe capacity limits represents a fundamental failure to meet the state’s duty of care to those held in its facilities,” according to the letter, which was written by Ohio state Reps. Christine Cockley and Mark Sigrist, and Ohio state Sen. Bill DeMora.

(Photo by Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)When Washington, D.C., agreed to hand over billions in land and tax breaks for a new Commanders football stadium, experts thought it would long remain an outlier in sweetheart deals for sports teams.
But just months later, attention turned to Kansas, where officials in December announced plans to fund 60% of a new stadium for the NFL’s Kansas City Chiefs. The state committed to spending up to $1.8 billion — the largest-ever professional sports subsidy.
Geoffrey Propheter, who studies stadium deals as an associate professor in the School of Public Affairs at the University of Colorado Denver, thought the Commanders deal would stand out for years to come “for how ludicrous it was.”
The D.C. Council in September finalized a plan to dedicate more than $1 billion in public funds to move the Commanders some 7 miles from a suburb in Maryland to a new facility planned for the old RFK Stadium site.
The city’s deal, which offers free riverfront land and exclusive development rights, means the district could forgo between $6 billion and $25 billion in revenue over time, Propheter said. By his calculations, that makes the planned Commanders stadium project the most valuable package ever awarded to a sports team. The team is primarily owned by Josh Harris, an investor with a net worth above $11 billion who also owns majority stakes in the NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers and the NHL’s New Jersey Devils.
The stadium deals in Washington and Kansas — both involving relocations within the same metropolitan area — have set separate records for taxpayer subsidies to sports teams. They serve as further evidence that public officials are uninterested in curbing giveaways to billionaire team owners, despite decades of research suggesting stadiums are a wasteful use of limited tax dollars.
And the deals could further push up the public price tag for projects in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey, all of which are discussing new or upgraded venues for NFL and NHL teams.
‘Pure emotion’ frequently drives debates on sports stadium deals

“Kansas lawmakers have done every NFL team and every pro-subsidy lawmaker everywhere else in the country a huge favor, because now teams can look at the Kansas deal and say, ‘Hey, what we’re asking for is not nearly as bad or as crazy or stupid as what Kansas is offering,’” Propheter said. “So now we’ve just pushed the expectation upward.”
Decades of research has found stadium subsidies are a poor investment of public dollars. Yet the median, inflation-adjusted stadium subsidy amount has ballooned over time.
The Chiefs deal is poised to surpass the $1.48 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars awarded to Montreal’s Olympic Stadium, opened in 1976, marking it as the costliest outlay ever in the U.S. and Canada, said J.C. Bradbury, a Kennesaw State University economics professor who researches stadium subsidies.
Adjusted to 2024 dollars, the median stadium subsidy for projects that opened in the 2010s was about $400 million. That increased to $605 million for projects slated to open in the 2020s. Already, 2030s-era projects have reached a median of $825 million, he said.
“There are many different ways we can measure these deals,” he said, “but by any metric, the recent Chiefs and Commanders deals are historically high.”
The Kansas deal
Kansas officials pushed aggressively to lure the Chiefs some 20 miles from their longtime home at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri.
Officials maintained the new stadium would spur billions of dollars in economic activity despite serious questions from experts and local officials about taxpayers’ ability to cover the massive new debt.
“Quite frankly, I believe [it is] the biggest economic win we’ll ever have in the state of Kansas,” Republican state House Speaker Dan Hawkins said last month.
Chiefs’ move to Kansas leaves experts grappling with possible revenue drain, massive unknowns

But officials also acknowledged the pursuit was about more than economics: Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly said landing the NFL team would make Kansas a tourist destination, help retain young people and defy stereotypes of Kansas as a flyover state.
“And what could be cooler than being home to the Kansas City Chiefs?” she said.
Kansas officials, the Chiefs and the Commanders did not respond to Stateline’s questions about the deals.
The Chiefs are owned by the Hunt family of Texas, one of the nation’s wealthiest families, estimated by Forbes to be worth nearly $25 billion.
As both the Chiefs and MLB’s Kansas City Royals — also in Missouri — openly weighed new stadiums in 2024, lawmakers in Topeka passed legislation amplifying an already lucrative tax incentive program to lure a pro sports team across State Line Road.
To fund Kansas’ expected $1.8 billion share of the new Chiefs stadium, state officials will divert sales taxes from a wide swath of the metropolitan area to pay back stadium debt. Officials say that won’t cause tax increases, but those tax diversions could cut deep into other city and state spending priorities.
Neil deMause, a journalist who has written extensively about stadium subsidies, said Kansas was effectively “negotiating against itself,” since Missouri was not prepared to offer such a lucrative deal. The same situation was true in Washington, he said, as it became clear that Maryland and Virginia, which were also vying for the new stadium, would not offer billions in free land and other benefits.
The new Chiefs stadium will be owned by the state, meaning the team won’t be subject to property taxes, a lucrative perk. The Chiefs will pay rent, but those funds will go into an account that can be used for ongoing facility maintenance and security. The state will also contribute millions to that fund every year.
The Chiefs will keep all revenue from ticket sales, parking and concessions, including for nonfootball events such as concerts and Final Four basketball games.
‘Painful day’: Missouri officials react to Chiefs announcing move to Kansas

In Missouri, the Chiefs had previously committed $126 million in funding for education, transportation, health care and other community benefits over a 40-year period. But no such arrangement has been announced in Kansas.
In a nonbinding 33-page term sheet released by the state, the team agreed to set aside $3 million per year for a community impact fund. That fund, though, is controlled by the Chiefs, who can spend it on charitable endeavors or on profit-generating, team-branded ventures like fitness clubs.
The Chiefs also agreed to match their current charitable and volunteer efforts in Missouri, but neither the team nor Kansas officials answered questions on how that provision would be calculated or enforced.
Kansas will receive some access to its stadium for events including graduation ceremonies and free concerts, but those are subject to team-determined availability, and the state must cover all costs.
State officials are guaranteed one stadium suite for most events. But the term sheet notes that state officials must pay for their own food, except for free soda and water.
“They could have at least held out for free jerseys or something,” deMause said.
‘It’s about panic’
The lopsided deal in Kansas will likely boost efforts by other team owners looking to update their facilities, deMause said.
“For whatever reason, we’re in a moment where team owners feel entitled to demand a lot more billions of dollars than anybody else has,” he said. “And the more they get away with that, the more their fellow owners are going to be emboldened to ask for the same thing.”
In Illinois, lawmakers have discussed for years an effort to relocate the NFL’s Chicago Bears from Soldier Field to a new site along Lake Michigan in Chicago or in the suburb of Arlington Heights. For decades, the team has been primarily owned by the McCaskey family. Last month, Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren cited a lack of “legislative partnership” in announcing the team would explore a potential stadium in neighboring Indiana.










We’re in a moment where team owners feel entitled to demand a lot more billions of dollars than anybody else has.


– Neil deMause, a journalist who has written about stadium subsidies


That news received an icy reception from Illinois lawmakers, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.
“I don’t believe it’s a real threat,” said Illinois state Rep. Kam Buckner, a Democrat whose district includes parts of Chicago’s South Side. Buckner said lawmakers have been pushing the team to provide a more detailed proposal before approving a package of taxpayer-funded site and infrastructure improvements.
Buckner said lawmakers in Springfield watched the Kansas stadium deal closely, but are determined not to follow a similar route.
“What happened in Kansas is exactly what Illinois should not do,” he said. “Kansas is preparing to hand billions of public dollars to one of the wealthiest ownership families in professional sports history — not for schools, not for transit, not for housing, but to subsidize a stadium for a team that’s already printing money.”
Buckner said his constituents have a long list of legislative priorities — ranging from health care to affordability issues — ahead of professional sports.
A devout Bears fan, Buckner said he won’t be drawn into a “hostage negotiation” with the team.
“It’s about panic. It’s about fear,” he said. “It’s about this system that we’ve created, where, if you don’t overpay, a billionaire might just take his toys and leave town, and folks are scared of that.”

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
The city of St. Albans recently bought the longtime office building of the local newspaper. Officials want to build apartments there – but first, the place needs work, and a new state program could help foot the bill. 
Dirty soil must be cleaned up on the site of the former Saint Albans Messenger printing press, and water, sewer and parking need upgrades before the city can court a developer to build the 14 homes and ground floor commercial space that officials envision, said St. Albans City Manager Dominic Cloud.
To finance that site work, local officials plan to turn to a new state program: The Community and Housing Infrastructure Program, or CHIP, which allows municipalities and developers to borrow money for infrastructure like roads, sidewalks and sewers for a housing development – and then use the property tax revenue boost from the new homes to help pay back the debt. 
The program could unleash $2 billion in infrastructure spending over the next decade. 
The initiative officially launches this month, after lawmakers and Gov. Phil Scott authorized its creation last summer. State officials opened a pre-application interest form and have kicked off a series of training sessions to drum up interest from municipal leaders and homebuilders.

“We basically have a once in a generation opportunity here,” said Jessica Hartleben, executive director of the Vermont Economic Progress Council, which oversees the program. 
CHIP is essentially a scaled-down version of Vermont’s existing tax increment financing program and is aimed at smaller towns. The Vermont League of Cities and Towns is standing up technical assistance to support municipalities in applying.    
As the program gets off the ground, bigger municipalities with plenty of TIF experience – like St. Albans – have begun eyeing it for projects that fall beyond their existing TIF districts. But some smaller towns have begun to register their interest, too. 
The Rutland County town of Fair Haven recently acquired a 24-acre former race track donated by a co-founder of the Castleton-based lighting company Hubbardton Forge. The town plans to utilize CHIP and ultimately spur the construction of middle-income homes for sale on the site, the Rutland Herald reported in late December.
Housing built via CHIP must be used as primary homes while the infrastructure debt gets paid off. Projects with a certain amount of affordable units get incentives, like the ability to retain a higher level of tax revenue. The local selectboard or city council will need to hold a public hearing on a municipality’s project before plans advance.
CHIP faced considerable scrutiny before its passage last legislative session. Democrats in the House pushed for more guardrails around the initiative, arguing that any new development that might have occurred even without help from the tax incentive would result in foregone property tax revenue to the overstretched Education Fund. Its loudest proponents – including the Scott administration and a new pro-housing lobby – argued that boosting the state’s overall housing supply would help spread the burden of high education costs.
When the market itself isn’t producing enough housing, local governments should play an active role in building more homes, said Cloud, from St. Albans.
“The city can use all the tools that the Legislature has given us to level the playing field and get the projects that we want,” he said. “The Messenger building is a great example of that.”
Applications for CHIP will open by the end of January, according to Hartleben.

(Photo by Jackyenjoyphotography/Getty Images)Four New Hampshire hospitals are among the more than 700 across the United States at risk of closing due to financial struggles, according to a December report from the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform.
The report does not identify which hospitals. Harold Miller, president and CEO of the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, acknowledged in an email exchange with the Bulletin that some of the data is not up to date, due to reporting delays, and a lot can change in a few years for a small hospital. Miller also said the report didn’t take into consideration which hospitals are part of larger health systems that can insulate them from financial challenges.
The center’s data shows four rural hospitals with negative operating margins. Concord Hospital-Laconia, Concord Hospital’s affiliate in the Lakes Region, was operating at a minus-7.7% margin, as of 2024, the most recent data available. Littleton Regional Healthcare, which recently announced plans to be acquired by Dartmouth Health, was operating at a minus-6.9% margin. Cheshire Medical Center in Keene, which has been affiliated with Dartmouth Health for over a decade, was operating at a minus-2.6% margin. And Cottage Hospital in Woodsville was operating at a minus-0.1% margin.
The Bulletin reached out to all four hospitals for comment.
“Although Cheshire Medical Center has had operating losses, we closed FY25 with a positive operating margin due to increased clinical volumes across the organization,” Joe Perras, CEO & President of Cheshire Medical Center, said in a statement to the Bulletin. “In our case, fortunately, Cheshire is a member of the Dartmouth Health system, which puts us in a stronger position, albeit challenged. Barring some unforeseen circumstance impacting the entire health system, the risk of closure is of no concern due to our affiliation with the Dartmouth Health system.”
Bob Nutter, CEO of Littleton Regional Healthcare, said in an email that the implementation of a new electronic health records system made their fiscal year 2024 “challenging,” but maintained “our overall financial footing remains solid.”
“The challenges LRH experienced were anticipated to some degree and not atypical,” he said. “In most instances, organizations can expect to experience similar challenges while navigating the complexities of converting EHRs (electronic health records).”
Nutter said financial challenges were not the motivation behind the hospital deciding to join Dartmouth Health.
“At the very beginning and through the affiliation process, our goal has been to ensure that high-quality, local health care remains strong for generations to come,” he said. “We are moving towards affiliating with Dartmouth Health because they share our vision, mission, and values. Financial issues have never been a driver for affiliating.”
Across the nation, more than 100 rural hospitals have closed over the past decade, according to the report. The 756 rural hospitals currently at risk of following suit, per the report, represent a third of all rural hospitals in the country. Of the 756, the report identified 323 at “immediate risk” of closing, including three of the four in New Hampshire.
The Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, which is based in Pittsburgh, blames health insurance companies for the hospitals’ financial challenges. Private health insurance plans, the report argues, are paying too little for patient services. The center also reports that hospitals lose money treating uninsured patients and those on Medicaid, though at a lower rate than privately insured patients.
The report emphasized how, in rural communities, many hospitals are a patient’s only option within their local community for services such as imaging or laboratory tests and primary care. That means when a rural hospital closes, patients are often forced to travel far for care, even in life-threatening situations.
While he acknowledged the challenging financial position rural hospitals are in, Steve Ahnen, president of the New Hampshire Hospital Association, told the Bulletin he wouldn’t go as far as the report in his own estimation.
“I don’t know enough about the methodology relative to who’s at risk of closure,” Ahnen said. “Financial challenges are very, very real, but I don’t know that there is a hospital in New Hampshire that is at risk of closure today. ”
Ahnen believes the more realistic threat is that hospitals are forced to reduce services.
The New Hampshire Hospital Association put out a report of its own in 2025 about the financial challenges Granite State hospitals are facing. That report found that seven hospitals, both rural and nonrural, had negative operating margins. It also reported that operating expenses rose 44% from 2019 to 2024 and labor costs rose 36.1%.
Ahnen cited a number of factors making it difficult for rural hospitals to function.
He decried how private insurers covering Medicare Advantage patients are denying coverage that traditional Medicare plans cover. Indeed, the U.S. Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General has repeatedly cited Medicare Advantage insurers for delaying or denying services that should be covered.
Ahnen also noted the difficult labor market in New Hampshire. The hospital association’s report highlighted that across the state’s health care industry, hospitals had a 13.1% vacancy rate for all positions. For registered nurses, the rate was 16.8% and for certified or licensed nurse assistants it was 15.9%. He urged policy makers to work on creating talent pipelines for these communities.
Lastly, Ahnen noted that challenges with rural EMS systems mean that hospitals often have to absorb the costs of housing patients who are waiting for ambulances or other transportation to move them.

(Photo by Glen Stubbe/Minnesota Reformer)Thousands took to the streets to protest a masked federal officer’s point-blank shooting Wednesday of a 37-year-old woman in Minnesota. As they did, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials didn’t address allegations of persistent violence by officers in Ohio.
One, a supervisor, has been charged after dozens of police calls alleging domestic violence against his much younger, noncitizen partner. Another was convicted of forcing a vulnerable immigrant to have sex with him.
ICE’s regional media office was asked by the Ohio Capital Journal more than two weeks ago whether it knew the supervisor’s history, but after asking for more time to respond, has not yet responded.
In Minneapolis, an unidentified ICE agent shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in the face Wednesday morning while she was behind the wheel of her SUV. Just after, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and later President Donald Trump claimed that Good was trying to run over the masked agent. 
But a New York Times analysis contradicted that claim. It displayed video evidence showing that Good was steering her vehicle away from the agent when he shot through her windshield mere feet away.
The analysis also showed agents blocking a man who said he was a doctor from assisting Good before medical help arrived. And it showed the shooter and other masked agents speeding away.
There are long-standing questions about the adequacy of the training ICE agents receive. And when Trump this year ramped up hiring to support his mass-deportation plans, people with criminal records and other disqualifications were hired without being adequately vetted.
Even so, Trump eased training and recruitment standards, and offered bonuses of up to $50,000, to attract more people. That raises fears among critics that things will get worse at an agency they say has long lacked adequate accountability and oversight.
In Ohio, immigrant advocates have been asking how ICE didn’t know about chronic, extreme allegations of domestic violence against Samuel Saxon, assistant field office director of the agency’s Enforcement and Removal Operations Cincinnati Suboffice.

In December, Saxon, 47, was arraigned on charges of attacking the woman he lived with and putting her in a chokehold after a neighbor shot video of part of the incident, prosecutors said.
Over the course of a year, police had been called to the residence about 23 times. In 2018, Saxon’s partner suffered a broken nose, and in April, she suffered a broken pelvis, WXIX reported prosecutors as saying.
Saxon began his relationship with the woman, a noncitizen, when she was 18 and he was in his 40’s, the station reported.
Saxon is also charged in federal court with lying to a federal investigator. 
In an interview with a Homeland Security special agent and a Cincinnati police officer, Saxon denied being in physical contact with his partner when the alleged attack took place. Saxon laughed as he said that — and at other junctures in the interview, according to a partial transcript that was included in his criminal complaint.
In one, he laughed as he referred to a completely separate incident.
“Do you want to hear the accusation that we got today?” the Cincinnati police officer asked.
“That’s fine. I mean, I imagine — now that you’re telling me all this, it’s not about the dude at the Mexican place, so [laughs],” Saxon said, according to the transcript.
Saxon’s federal public defender didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
ICE’s Midwest media office was asked on Dec. 26 whether it knew about Saxon’s history. On Dec. 29, it asked for more time to respond. As of Thursday, it still hadn’t.
Lynn Tramonte, founder of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance, said it’s impossible that ICE officials didn’t know about allegations against Saxon, a supervisor in one of the agency’s field offices.
In an email referring to published allegations against Saxon, she said:
“There’s no way ICE was unaware of Saxon’s history of violence. His victim had broken bones that required surgery… The police came to his home 23 times in less than a year and a half. He had a DUI.

“One of his bosses even called the police to do a welfare check when he didn’t show up for work, and they found him holding a knife. His supervisor admitted he was a ‘loose cannon.’ This went on for years, ICE knew about it, and they kept promoting Saxon instead of firing him. That’s not how a law enforcement agency should operate.”
Saxon’s arrest comes after a federal jury in 2024 convicted Andrew Golobic, an ICE deportation officer in Cincinnati, of extorting sex from a noncitizen woman over whom he had power. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison last March.
In a press release announcing his conviction, the U.S. Justice Department said that Golobic exploited the woman even though he had a special responsibility to protect people who had already been victimized.
“In his role, Golobic supervised immigrants with vulnerable backgrounds including those fleeing violence, exploitation, and sexual assault,” it said. 
“Golobic knew he had power over women under his supervision. Golobic had discretion over the degree of freedom and movement afforded to participants under his supervision.”
In justifying mass detentions and deportations, Trump and his administration have claimed they’re getting rid of violent criminals. But a November analysis by the Cato Institute found that just 5% of detainees had been convicted of violent crimes, while 73% have no convictions at all.
Tramonte said Trump and his subordinates should look closer to home if they want to fight violent crime.
“I find it ironic that we’re constantly hearing DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin make up lies about immigrants, calling every single one a criminal, yet we haven’t heard a word from DHS about the dangerous crimes that ICE agents are committing,” she said. 
Of Saxon, she added, “If he was an immigrant, DHS would have posted his mugshot all over the media by now. Instead, they are avoiding questions from the media because he’s one of their own, and there’s no excuse for keeping him in his position for so long. There’s something very rotten at the Cincinnati ICE office, and hiding from the truth doesn’t change it.”

In a recent ruling from the Ohio First District Court of Appeals, a lawsuit over the 2019 Ohio Senate Bill 23 law, which created the state’s near-total abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest among other provisions, was sent back to a trial court.
The trial court had previously rejected both the law’s abortion ban after six weeks’ gestation and the other provisions related to abortion care that were passed along with it.
The appellate court judges said the unconstitutionality of the abortion ban was not in dispute during the appeal.
Instead, the appeal focused on provisions such as those that required physicians to check for a fetal or embryonic cardiac activity before conducting an abortion, and record-keeping requirements.
The First District said the appeal was “less about abortion, and more about civil procedure and the equitable authority of Ohio’s courts.”
The case stemmed from a lawsuit in the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas, where women’s health clinics and the ACLU of Ohio sued the state.
The law had been entangled in court battles since it was signed into law by Gov. Mike DeWine in 2019, first being put on hold while Roe vs. Wade was still in place, and then being put into active law for several months in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade.
Activists then sued and the law was blocked again by the Hamilton County court. The lawsuit against the law was bolstered after 57% of Ohio voters in 2023 passed a reproductive rights amendment to the Ohio Constitution.
In October 2024, Hamilton County Judge Christian Jenkins permanently overturned the six-week abortion ban and the provisions that went with S.B. 23, citing the constitutional amendment as one of the reasons for striking down the law.
“For even after a majority of Ohio’s voters … presumably both women and men – approved an amendment to the Ohio Constitution protecting the right to pre-viability abortion on Oct. 8, 2023, the (Ohio) Attorney General urges this court to leave ‘untouched’ all but one provision of the so-called ‘Heartbeat Act’ clearly rejected by Ohio voters,” Jenkins wrote in his 2024 decision.
Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost’s office decided not to fight the rejection of the six-week abortion ban itself, but instead has argued to the appeals court that not all of S.B. 23 should be declared unconstitutional, and some of the provisions in the bill even existed before being added to the law, so some of the law should be allowed to remain intact.
They also argued that the challengers of the law never presented an argument that provisions other than the abortion ban were unconstitutional.
Senate Bill 23 included a “severability” clause, which is a legal concept that allows parts of legislation to continue, even if other parts of the law have been struck down by a court or removed.

As the appellate court put it, severability involves interpreting the law in a way that asks, “what should the court understand the law to be, given that the unconstitutional provision cannot be enforced?”
It is that severability clause that was the main argument by the state in oral arguments to the First District Court of Appeals last September.
Ohio Deputy Solicitor General Stephen Carney said striking down the six-week abortion ban “did not create a super abortion exception” applying to all other parts of the law, and upholding the trial court decision would impact every other law, regardless of subject, passed in the state.
An attorney for the health clinics and abortion rights advocates said the provisions shouldn’t be allowed, because their role was to enforce and uphold the abortion ban that had been struck down.
“Those don’t just stand on their own; they have no meaning without the rest of the ban in place,” said attorney Cassie Mitchell in September.
The appellate court agreed with the state that the lower court should not have ruled that the provisions outside of the ban should be struck down. The judges said the other provisions “are presumptively constitutional.”
“The allegations in (the lawsuit challenger’s) complaint centered around the harm plaintiffs and others would suffer under (the six-week abortion) ban, but not under the disputed provisions,” the court wrote in its decision.
The attorney general’s office was “pleased to see the appeals court agree with what we said all along – it is important for courts and parties to follow procedural rules.”
“Here, proper procedure was not followed, so the appeals court ordered a do-over in the trial court,” a spokesperson for Yost stated.
The clinics and pro-abortion advocates in the case said they were glad to see the court keep the six-week abortion ban under wraps.
“Ohioans have unequivocally rejected politicians’ attempts to ban abortion, and the ruling is a step in the right direction to continue protecting the right for all people in our state to make choices over their own personal medical decisions,” according to a joint statement. “Abortion remains legal in Ohio up to 21 weeks (and) six days of pregnancy.”

(iStock / Getty Images Plus)The Ohio Department of Health has warned residents about a new outbreak of measles identified in Cuyahoga County.
This past Thursday, the department announced the first measles cases of 2026, three children from a household in the Northeast Ohio county.
The state health department said all the children were unvaccinated at the time, and had traveled outside Ohio to “an area in the United States with an ongoing measles outbreak.”
“The fact that we have measles cases in Ohio underlines the importance of being fully vaccinated,” said Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff, director of the Ohio Department of Health. “This disease can be very serious, but it is also preventable.”
Ohio has had three years over the last two decades where measles numbers rose above single digits: last year’s 44 cases, 2022’s 90, and a 2014 outbreak of 382 cases tied to an Amish community with limited vaccinations.
The 2014 case happened after the Ohio residents took a mission trip to the Philippines, a country that was experiencing an active spread with thousands of cases. The Ohio outbreak made national headlines and caught the attention of medical researchers.

Outside of 2025, 2022, and 2014, Ohio has seen only 27 cases since 2000, according to state data. Measles was declared “eliminated” in the United States in 2000, according to the CDC, meaning the continuous spread of the disease hadn’t occurred in more than a year.
“This was thanks to a highly effective vaccination program in the United States, as well as better measles control in the Americas region,” the CDC stated on their website.
With measles cases now increasing in states across the country, that eliminated status could be in doubt, especially as vaccination rates decline as well.
The overall vaccination rates of kindergartners has gone down, according to the federal agency, but in the 2024-2025 school year, about 286,000 U.S. kindergartners attended school without documentation of the immunization for measles – called the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.
In Ohio, CDC data showed 88.3% MMR vaccination coverage among kindergartners for that school year. The rate was down from the previous year, when coverage was shown at 89.2%.
The decline also comes at a time when Trump administration officials have reduced the number of vaccines recommended for children, though the most recent changes left the recommendation for the MMR vaccine in place.
The Ohio Department of Health said Thursday that while measles is extremely contagious, spread through coughing and sneezing, the MMR vaccine is “very safe and effective.”
Receiving the two doses of the vaccine, as the CDC currently recommends, is 97% effective, and the risk of getting sick is “very low” if Ohioans are up to date, according to the state.
“If people are not protected against the disease, nine out of 10 people who are exposed will become ill,” the state health department stated.
The infection can live for up to two hours in the air, and people infected with measles can spread it starting four days before a rash appears, and continue spreading it until four days after.
Symptoms other than a rash include a high fever, runny nose, cough, loss of appetite, and red, watery eyes.
Complications can occur, most commonly in children younger than 5, adults older than 20, pregnant individuals, and those with compromised immune systems.
Measles complications can include diarrhea and ear infections, along with pneumonia, which the state health department is the most common cause of death in young children with the disease.

A state court has extended a temporary block on Ohio’s plan to tap unclaimed funds to help pay for a new Cleveland Browns stadium in Brook Park — along with other sports and cultural facilities across the state.
A temporary restraining order preventing the state from moving money around was set to expire at 5 p.m. Thursday. Now it will stay in place, while the court weighs whether to approve a preliminary injunction to block the state from taking permanent ownership of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion in misplaced money while a legal battle plays out.
“The TRO’s going to remain in effect until this preliminary injunction hearing is decided,” said Jennifer Hunt, a Franklin County Common Pleas Court magistrate who presided over a hearing in Columbus on Thursday.
“So the status quo will stay in place?” asked Jeff Crossman, one of the lawyers representing Ohioans with unclaimed funds.
“Yes,” Hunt said.
That unclaimed funds at the center of this fight are from old bank accounts, insurance policies, uncashed checks, utility deposits and other sources. The state is sitting on nearly $5 billion that belongs to people, businesses, nonprofits and local government entities.
The Ohio General Assembly voted last year to move unclaimed funds the state has been holding for at least a decade into a new fund dedicated to sports and cultural facilities.
The first $1 billion originally was scheduled to transfer into that sports and cultural facilities fund on Jan. 1, with $600 million of it earmarked as a grant for the new Browns stadium project in Brook Park. But a Franklin County judge issued the temporary restraining order on Dec. 23, delaying the move.
Lawyers representing Ohioans with unclaimed funds are fighting the state’s move, calling it an unconstitutional taking of private property that will ultimately benefit the Browns and team owner Haslam Sports Group. Those attorneys, led by Marc Dann and Jeff Crossman of DannLaw, also argue that Ohio needs to do much more to notify people about their unclaimed funds before cutting off their rights to the money.
They’re asking a Franklin County Common Pleas Court judge to maintain the status quo by issuing a preliminary injunction.
“Isn’t there a tension now between the state’s purpose of reuniting owners with their property — and using that money to transfer into another account to pay for sports facilities?” Crossman said during Thursday’s hearing.
Attorneys for the state, meanwhile, argue that people with unclaimed funds that have been sitting for more than a decade have had ample time to file claims. They assert that the General Assembly’s recent changes to the state’s unclaimed funds program don’t violate the Ohio or U.S. constitutions.
And they’re fighting the preliminary injunction request.
The state’s lawyers say the division of unclaimed funds still has plenty of money left to fulfill claims. They’ve pointed out that anyone whose missing money gets claimed by the state this year can still seek repayment until Jan. 1, 2036, under a grace period created by state lawmakers.
Going forward, people will have a decade to file claims and get paid. The clock will start ticking when a bank or other business turns missing money or property over to the state, which acts as custodian — a lost and found for owners.
It’s unclear when Franklin County Common Pleas Court Judge Julie Lynch will make a decision about the preliminary injunction.
A separate, but similar, lawsuit is playing out in federal court over the state’s plan to set a clock — for the first time — on people’s ability to claim their missing money. In December, a federal judge declined to issue a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to keep the state from moving the money.
The lawyers representing Ohioans with unclaimed funds appealed — and asked the appeals court to approve an injunction.
On Thursday, the appeals court declined to do that. In a two-page order, the court said “plaintiffs have not even remotely shown that they face irreparable harm absent an injunction.”
A spokesman for the Browns declined to comment on the litigation Thursday afternoon. But he said the team remains confident in its timeline for the Brook Park stadium project, with a groundbreaking expected this year.

Hush stripped Emporia State University for parts, firing tenured faculty and overseeing an exodus of students. He thankfully departed at the end of 2025, with the Board of Regents hiring an experienced university administrator to replace him. Hush, it must be noted, had no advanced degrees or experience in running a college.
Kansas legislative leaders looked at the smoldering crater of ESU and decided: We want that for all Kansas schools.











That’s right, they’ve voted to pay Hush $10,000 a month for five months to help lawmakers “be very careful and prudent with the dollars in our budget,” in the words of House Speaker Dan Hawkins, R-Wichita. This comes after legislative budget writers made noise last month about supposedly wasteful spending by institutions of higher education.











I’ll grant Hush this: He can instantly identify $50,000 of excess spending.
His consulting salary.
It’s difficult to look at Hush’s hiring, along with budget committee chatter, and not come to a dreary conclusion: Hawkins, Senate President Ty Masterson and their allies in legislative leadership mean to kneecap higher education in Kansas. In the process, they hope to leave state universities weaker and poorer and their students dumber.
There are politically practical reasons for this. College towns like Lawrence and Manhattan routinely vote for Democrats. Even college towns like Pittsburg and Hays look less red than their surrounding areas. The two main parties have separated along educational lines, and healthy universities threaten Republican leaders’ political project.
If too many people go to Kansas universities, too many Democrats will be elected. So Masterson, Hawkins and their ilk mean to destroy universities to preserve their political power.
Call it the knucklehead agenda.
I must make myself clear early in this column. I don’t believe that all or even most Republicans subscribe to that approach. I don’t believe that all or even most Republicans want such policy outcomes.They’re not knuckleheads, and they don’t want anyone else to be a knucklehead either.
I am instead highlighting a small number of powerful Kansas Republicans who serve in the Legislature. Masterson and Hawkins are among them, as are allies who chair or sit on key committees.
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, left, and Senate President Ty Masterson speak during a Jan. 8, 2026, legislative meeting. They voted to hire former Emporia State University president Ken Hush as a consultant on higher education budgets. (Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
These Republicans, as we have seen repeatedly over the past several years, have priorities more in line with national conservative news media and President Donald Trump‘s administration then any traditional form of Kansas Republicanism.
They’re the ones who wanted to redistrict to push out U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids. And they’re the ones who want to either destroy or remake universities into rightwing propaganda mills.











This might sound overwrought, except for the fact that it is happening in other states, too. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and his conservative allies have reshaped the formerly liberal New College. Professors and students have left, and the state has poured money into the school to keep it viable (much as Kansas lawmakers sent an extra $18 million to Emporia State to balance the books).











In Texas, legislators have barred a swath of subjects from even being taught. Texas A&M University informed a professor this month that he cannot teach Plato. Why? The ancient Greek’s writings don’t match officials’ ideas about race and gender.
So no, conservative ideologues don’t want to restore classical education. They want to preserve their antediluvian political project.
Attempts to follow a similar playbook in Emporia didn’t work either. Enrollment dropped for several years (it rebounded slightly in 2025), and the university is handing out record scholarships to entice students. Special giveaways from the Legislature kept the whole enterprise from collapsing. To reiterate: Emporia State hasn’t saved money. It has benefited from ideological largesse.
This is happening. It is real. Universities will be targeted and brought to heel. Republican politicians want to ensure that the next generation of college graduates — if they graduate at all — will quickly and uncomplainingly administer the Gilded Age fantasies of our billionaire class.
No one who runs a university in Kansas can say what I just wrote. No high-ranking Democrat in the House or Senate can say it either. In either case, they can’t talk about what’s going on because Hawkins and Masterson and their ilk will punish them for doing so. Look at what happened after Democratic Rep. Ford Carr raised concerns about racism last year.
But I’m not an elected official, and I’m not a university administrator. I’m just putting down what I see.
Beyond students, the greatest victims in this all are principled and courageous conservatives. Public thinkers such as William F. Buckley Jr. and Norman Podhoretz, George Will and Thomas Sowell, believed in the superiority of their ideas without the necessity of silencing opposing views. They engaged in persuasion and public debate.
Modern conservative leaders in Kansas no longer believe in such values. They don’t want discussion or compromise. They want to accumulate power, and they want to deploy that power against political enemies.
If it means creating a state full of knuckleheads, so be it. They already control of most of the Statehouse.

To many policymakers in Ohio, this is a key public policy issue. Last year, Gov. Mike DeWine urged university officials to ramp-up recruitment efforts to “keep more talent in the state of Ohio.”
There is some truth to the benefits of population growth to population vitality. 
New people means new ideas, new businesses, new consumers. I like living in a city with a vibrant immigrant community where I can eat foods from places like the Philippines and go to karaoke nights where people sing Brazilian standards. 
I also like having friends from states ranging from Pennsylvania to California who have different backgrounds and life experiences from me.
But population decline can be a symptom as much as a cause of quality of life problems, if not more. 
The slowest-growing states in the country, West Virginia and Mississippi, are also states that struggle with the highest poverty rates, lowest educational attainment, and lowest life expectancies.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Understanding causality is hard here, though. 
Surely people with higher education and income have more ability to move from state to state, meaning part of what is causing these poor statistics is just losing people who are better off. 
On the other hand, there are reasons they are leaving, too, that could be attributed to quality of life.
Then there are the exceptional states like Vermont, which is one of the slowest growing states in the country despite having one of the lowest poverty rates and some of the highest educational attainment and life expectancies among U.S. states. 
Clearly there is something happening with Vermont. Meanwhile, Montana had bottom-five population growth in 2024, but is around the middle of the country when it comes to poverty, education, and life expectancy.
So what should we make of Ohio’s population growth trajectory? 
Compared to the rest of the country, Ohio has a high poverty rate (top half of U.S. states), low bachelor’s degree attainment (bottom half of U.S. states), and low life expectancy (bottom half of U.S. states). That means Ohio looks a lot more like the Mississippis and West Virginias of the country than it looks like Vermont and Montana. 
If this is the case, population decline could be an indicator for deeper quality of life problems in the state.
Ultimately, these other statistics matter more to Ohio’s trajectory than population growth. 
If Ohio lost 700,000 residents on net due to births, natural deaths, and migration rates but the poverty rate declined, bachelor’s degree attainment improved, and life expectancies rose, I think pretty much everyone would agree the state would be better off than it was before. 
Targeting public policy toward reducing poverty, increasing educational attainment, and improving public health will likely lead to a more well-off state population than one that focuses squarely on population growth. 
Let’s realize that quality of life is the most important consideration for Ohio residents, not how many people decide to move in or out of the state.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Nebraska’s high school curriculum standards do not make George Orwell’s “1984” mandatory reading. The state, however, allows latitude to local districts so the novel might show up on an English class syllabus because reading the book would cover many of the bases spelled out in Nebraska’s standards for critical reading. 
For those who get that chance and those who already have, one line from Orwell’s masterpiece has taken on a haunting patina as it intersects with headlines from today’s and yesterday’s news: “The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.”
We call Orwell’s “doublethink,” accepting two contradictory ideas as in “War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength,” cognitive dissonance, a psychological malady. Even as artificial intelligence challenges us to ferret out “slop” generated by large language models and deepfake videos, we can, for the most part, still believe what we see. 
That’s why when a number of videos reveal the same thing — that a Minneapolis woman, 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, does not appear to be trying to run over a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent when, claiming self-defense, he shot and killed her — our vision does not square with what the feds are feeding us. That includes a view from the shooter’s perspective.
In a federal rush to judgment — calling Good, “that woman,” a “professional agitator,” part of a “sinister left-wing movement” and in the act of committing “domestic terrorism” — the president, vice president, Homeland Security secretary and White House spokeswoman painted a picture the actual pictures do not support, essentially asking us to reject what we saw and heard. 
We’ve been here before. The videotaped beating of Rodney King after a traffic stop following a high-speed chase in Los Angeles in 1991 stunned us. The grainy video shot from the balcony of a nearby apartment showed LAPD officers relentlessly pounding King with nightsticks. 
Four of the officers went on trial for use of excessive force. Their defense centered on King posing a threat — that his erratic behavior and aggressive demeanor before the video justified the savage beating. But the images we saw were of a man offering no resistance being pummeled 33 times with night sticks, tased twice and kicked repeatedly for over four minutes. As you know, the officers were acquitted, and the City of Angels burned for the next five days.
In May of 2020 a Minneapolis police officer knelt on the neck of George Floyd for nine minutes to restrain him after his arrest for passing a counterfeit $20 bill. The “restraint” killed Floyd. At the officer’s trial, part of his defense was that the kneeling was necessary and “objectively reasonable,” even when Floyd became motionless. Our eyes and ears saw something else, thanks to an alert citizen, as did the jury that convicted the police officer, sentencing him to over 30 years in prison.
Having just passed the five-year anniversary of a violent mob storming the nation’s Capitol to undo the results of a free and fair election because of a lie, we again are asked to disbelieve what we saw and heard. The White House website, updated just last week, insists the 2020 presidential election was rigged and now places blame for the Jan. 6 insurrection on U.S. Capitol Police for escalating peaceful protests into “chaos” and on Democrats who “staged the real insurrection by certifying a fraud-ridden election.” The site goes on to accuse then-Vice President Mike Pence of “cowardice and sabotage” as he oversaw the eventual certification of the election results, his constitutional duty.
On his first day in office, the president pardoned over 1,500 people for their role in riots that severely damaged the Capitol and risked undoing the republic.
Meanwhile, as of this writing, the FBI is blocking local authorities in Minneapolis from access to evidence as it investigates the killing of Good. The city’s schools closed for the balance of the week according to Minnesota Public Radio News after ICE agents showed up on a high school’s property, handcuffed two staff members and tackled people at dismissal. 
As you recall, Winston Smith, Orwell’s protagonist in “1984,” works in the Ministry of Truth, where he alters historical tracts and documents to align the past with the Party’s current vision. Incumbent on all of us in today’s world where political, industrial, cultural, religious and technological leaders, with and without AI, commonly mislead, misinform and lie to their advantage, we must all be our own ministers of truth, our own debunkers of doublethink.
To that end, perhaps Nebraska high school curriculum standards should make “1984” mandatory. Better yet, today’s headlines should make it required reading for us all.

But, the housing market has experienced a lot of highs and lows over the past few years, and many buyers are sitting on the sidelines wondering if now is the right time for them to buy.
Here are a few questions and considerations to determine where you are in your homebuying journey and your next steps to securing the keys to your new home.
When is the right time to buy?
The market is ever-changing, and there’s a lot you can’t control. So focus on what you can control, which is your financial readiness, because the best time to buy is when you’re financially prepared to. Rates aren’t the only thing impacting housing affordability, and educating yourself on the homebuying process  and making informed decisions may help you find additional areas to save.
If buyers are concerned about daily rate fluctuations, consumers might be able to lock in today’s rate while they shop around. For instance, Chase’s Homebuyer Advantage with Lock and Shop program allows borrowers who are eligible to lock in their rate for 90 days while they begin the homebuying process. They also may be eligible for a one time option to lower their rate if rates improve. 
How do I know if I am financially ready for homeownership?
Homeownership is a dream for many, but most people don’t know that their dreams may be within reach. Here are some signs you may be ready to take on homeownership:
            •           Your financial health is sound. This might look like having a regular, dependable source of income, having a good credit score—lenders typically look for a score of 620 and above—and having a low debt-to-income ratio. This allows lenders to better gauge how much you may be able to afford.
            •           You understand the true cost of homeownership: This might look like understanding not only your borrowing capacity but also the monthly payment. You’re also prepared for the additional costs of buying a home, such as closing costs, property taxes, homeowners association fees, among other costs, as well as ongoing maintenance or repairs. Look for financial tools like the Chase affordability calculator to help determine buying power, based on income, and preferred monthly loan payments.
            •           Your personal goals and timelines match up: Think about your upcoming life events and whether it makes sense to own a home, such as retiring, relocating or a growing family.
What else can I do to save on the costs of homeownership?
A big misconception is that you have to put 20% of the total purchase price of the home down, but some loan types offer low down payment options—such as FHA and VA loans. For example, Chase’s DreamMaker Mortgage has flexible credit guidelines and down payments as low as 3%.
Find local assistance programs to help reduce items like closing costs, down payments or interest rates. There are assistance programs at the local, state, and national levels to support homebuyers on their path to homeownership. You can checkout tools like the Homebuyer Assistance Finder that helps you research and find additional assistance programs you may qualify for, such as Chase’s Homebuyer Grant which offers up to $5,000 in qualifying neighborhoods.
Also, don’t be shy to shop around for your loan — make lenders compete for your business. Check in with more than one lender and compare and contrast terms to get the best deal possible.

The 2026 Florida Legislative Session kicks off tomorrow.
You psyched? I know I am.
We can witness the majesty of democracy at work, the glory of our constitutional system, the sheer fabulousness of our elected representatives as they conduct the People’s Business.
My top priority — yours, too, I’m sure — is the state bird.
Mockingbirds are usually about ten inches in length, with a fifteen-inch wingspan, grayish upper portions, white undersides, and white patches on the tail and wings.Via FL Department of State
Our state avian is the Northern Mockingbird, a noisy and ill-mannered little bastard who likes to pick fights with other critters.
We’ve been stuck with this gray, aggressive, song-plagiarizing critter since 1927.
But perhaps not for much longer.
Rep. Jim Mooney, R-Islamorada, has once again filed a bill to replace the mockingbird with the flamingo.
He insists the change is vital: “If you ask people around the state of Florida what’s the state bird, very few people ever say the mockingbird. They’ll say the flamingo, they might say a pelican.”
Mooney reasons that, because flamingos feature on Florida postcards, the plastic variety are stuck into Florida lawns and appear on the Florida Lottery logo, it must replace the mockingbird.
Like the mockingbird, the flamingo is native to Florida, although in the early 20th century we damn near hunted it to extinction, “harvesting” its pretty feathers to adorn the hats of fashionable ladies.
“The reality of it is the flamingo represents Florida,” he says. “It always has since I was a kid.”
The mockingbird is also the official bird of some other states, so it’s not special enough for the special state of Florida.
Nevertheless, it has its defenders, including several North Florida lawmakers who feel the flamingo, all sleek pinkness and skinny supermodel legs, is a South Florida thing unrepresentative of the state’s non-pastel regions.
The only time a flamingo comes near the Panhandle is when a storm blows one up here.
‘Evil little bird’
Mooney’s biggest problem, however, may be Marion Hammer, former NRA president and longtime NRA lobbyist.
The woman feels very strongly about the m-bird.
“Mockingbirds have exceptional vocal abilities,” she says, “and can mimic songs of other birds, and the noise of mechanical devices like sports cars and tones on cellphones.”
Flamingos, on the other hand, produce a kind of nasal honk.
Florida Scrub-Jay viaFlorida Fish and WildlifeConservation Commission
Perhaps to mollify the anti-flamingo contingent, Mooney’s bill would also name the Florida Scrub Jay the state’s official songbird.
The scrub jay is the only bird endemic to Florida; its presence on our peninsula goes back 2 million years.
It’s clever and sports sky blue feathers: a lovely little critter beloved by all who see it.
Almost all.
As Coach Lee Corso, another famous Floridian, liked to say, “Not so fast, my friend!”
The Hammer hates the scrub jay, calling it an “evil little bird” whose kind “steal other birds’ eggs and kill the babies of other birds.”
Worse, because the scrub jay is friendly and will eat seeds and nuts out of your hand, she says it has a “welfare mentality.”
Really, really bad, the scrub jay is a threatened species, which means tree-huggers and their radical leftist Audubon Society ilk want to protect its shrinking habitat and stop decent Christian developers from paving over it.
The fate of Mooney’s bill may depend on whether the Hammer decides to oppose it.
Remember, she’s armed.
Suffer the little children
While we’re on the subject  of “welfare mentality,” Speaker of the House Daniel Perez is pushing a brace of bills to punish people who insist on being poor.
Or a child or old or pregnant or disabled or all the above.
Following the example of the huge bill Donald Trump calls “beautiful” and most Americans call “ugly,” Perez wants to cut aid to what Jesus (remember him?) called “the least among us.”
Perez and his pet House Republicans will tighten SNAP eligibility and slash Medicaid and Florida’s low-cost children’s health insurance program.
He says it’s to save money.
Fewer kids will have access to care. And thanks to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and our science-challenged state surgeon general, far fewer will be vaccinated.
You know what will happen: A non-immunized, no longer insured child gets measles or chicken pox or RSV, infects a whole classroom of other children, and has to go to the Emergency Room, thus costing everybody a lot more than if the child could get treated without bankrupting the parents.
Speaker Perez calls this “protecting taxpayer dollars.”
Also on the health beat, Rep. Jeff Holcomb, R-Spring Hill, wants to allow you to get ivermectin at your neighborhood Walgreen’s. No age restrictions, no prescription necessary.
Ivermectin, in case you have forgotten, is an anti-parasitic drug, good for round worms, hook worms, whipworms, and head lice.
What it’s not good for, according to reputable clinical trials, is COVID-19, despite quacks across the nation claiming it is.
Sojourners
At this point, you may be wondering if the Legislature plans to do anything to improve transparency, accountability, and the lives of ordinary citizens.
There are a few promising bills.
Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, wants ICE to take off the masks and wear visible IDs when they’re going around terrorizing people.
Given that ICE seems to enjoy apprehending anyone they don’t like the look of, including U.S. citizens, you’d think it was only fair — constitutional, even — for them to show identification.
As for the detainees, other lawmakers think it might be an idea to keep better track of them. FDLE has a database of a sort, logging “suspected unauthorized alien encounters.”
Senate Minority Leader Lori Berman, D-Boca Raton, wants a more comprehensive public database of who gets detained and how, where they were born, where they’re being held, and if they’re moved to another prison.
Right now, if someone is held in one of the state’s Sites of Penal Alliteration — ”Alligator Alcatraz,” “Deportation Depot” — their families and their lawyers may not be able to locate them.
However, as long as Gov. Ron DeSantis can keep claiming Florida is under a “state of emergency” (renewed for the 19th time in December), legislative oversight can be ignored, detainees can be abused in vile facilities, and the state can build all the “Alligator Alcatrazes” it wants.
No accountability.
According to DeSantis, hordes of rampaging undocumented types “remain within the State of Florida;” therefore he needs king-like powers to make sure they’re not running around mowing lawns and mopping nursing home floors.
Sen. Tina Polsky, D-Boca Raton says, “The state of emergency has allowed the governor to skirt more than two dozen state laws, including those related to requirements for competitive bidding, oversight of excessive spending, proper licensing, public transparency, and safety restrictions.”
People, Florida government IS the emergency.
Fetal personhood
Of the 20,000 arrested in Florida last year, a third had some kind of criminal conviction — anything from shoplifting to assault. The others either had no criminal past or else had been charged with heinous offenses such as driving without a license.
Some of those hauled in by ICE have pending asylum claims — they’re here legally. Others are United States citizens.
The worst of the worst, y’all.
Don’t expect anything to happen with these immigration-related proposals.
They’re sponsored by Democrats.
The ruling majority is likely to ignore them completely in favor of bills promoting hatred, cruelty, and destruction.
Rep. Shane Abbott, R-DeFuniak Springs, thinks a family member should be able to sue anyone who aids a woman in getting an abortion, even if, 1. The woman wants the abortion; and 2. The abortion takes place in a state or country where it’s perfectly legal.
Parents could also sue over the “wrongful death” of what SB 164 refers to as “a member of the species Homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.”
This is a fetal personhood bill.
The persistent Sen. Erin Grall, R-Vero Beach, files it every year, hell-bent on criminalizing miscarriages, medical abortions, perhaps even contraceptives such as IUDs.
It would essentially give a fetus the same legal status as the woman who carries it.
If that’s not enough to make you consider moving to Tierra del Fuego, check out Sen. Stan McClain’s bid to make pollution great again.
Environmental plunder
SB 479 would stop uppity local governments from enacting their own water quality and wetlands protection rules.
Those rules make developers sad.
County and city governments across the state know something McClain and his ilk don’t get: Floridians like nature.
They want to protect local ecosystems.
They want clean water.
Wetlands are critical to clean water.
But this bill would let the Department of Environmental “Protection” decide who gets to pollute and where.
Of course, what they’ll decide is to let the developers who own state government lock, stock, and barrel haul off and build that huge new subdivision.
Never mind the run-off.
Did I mention McClain’s a residential contractor?
Perhaps he’d like to do some business in scrub jay habitat. The little sucker isn’t monetizing it.
And once that land has roads and houses and Starbucks, Publixes, and Wawas, Marion Hammer won’t ever have to worry about that bird again.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC12185.jpg,,,2026-01-12 00:12:09.892877
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-12 05:02:48+00:00,CT Mirror,"HB 8002: The good, the confusing, the dysfunctional",Tim Hollister and Andrea Gomes,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/12/cts-new-housing-law-hb8002-the-good-the-confusing-the-dysfunctional/,"CT's new housing law has many good provisions, but also sections that are confusing, and some that conflict with existing law.","This three-part series of articles summarizes “November Special Session Public Act 25-1,”  Connecticut’s new housing law, commonly referred to as HB 8002. 
This first of three pieces reviews what the Act does not do; its most beneficial provisions (most of which are not directly related to housing production); and two important study committees from which the Act requires reports in early 2026. Both have potential to improve or obstruct affordable housing. 
Part Two, tomorrow, will discuss the new Council on Housing Development and the Act’s housing programs: parking rules; transit-oriented communities; conversions of commercial and mixed-use zones to middle housing; priority housing development zones; Department of Housing-led developments; and tweaks to § 8-30g’s moratorium rules.  
Part Three will address the Act’s new regime of municipal and regional housing growth plans; and opportunities for developers and the General Assembly in 2026.
As we explain below, overall, the Act has many good provisions, but also too many sections that are confusing, and some that conflict with existing law and will likely be dysfunctional in practice.
What the act does not do
The Act does not tinker with, much less overhaul, the core problem of our land-use system:  169 towns, each exercising the broad discretionary powers of General Statutes § 8-2, the Zoning Enabling Act.  
In September 2024, Tim Hollister, a co-author of this article, wrote about how our system preserves the parochial status quo of exclusionary regulation and economic segregation.  
He stated that the legislature should recognize how towns are using their land-use authority to prevent lower-cost housing production; devise a list of powers and procedures to be purged or pruned; and then summon the political will to revise the state-local balance of delegated authority.  The new Act does little to address this goal, and in fact creates more roadblocks to progress.  The Act refers to financial incentives to amend zoning regulations but those “carrots” are not yet spelled out, and the Act otherwise contains no zoning regulation revision mandates.  There are no bold initiatives similar to what other states have adopted in recent years.
Continuing a statewide trend years in the making, the Act reconfirms a central role for General Statutes § 8-30g, the affordable housing statute, not only by leaving it substantively unchanged but also by adopting, in the new housing programs, several measures that utilize standards taken from § 8-30g, such as specifying when land-use commissions must demonstrate a public health or safety basis for denying permits (the § 8-30g standard), rather than the traditional standard of “health, safety, and the general welfare.”  The new Act recognizes that § 8-30g is now embedded in dozens of local housing programs and is here to stay.
The Act incentivizes municipalities to work with the Connecticut Municipal Development Authority (CMDA), created in 2019, funded in 2024, and now up-and-running.  That program encourages development agreements that will commit towns to affordable and multi-family development, mainly in transit-oriented locations.  However, the Act creates several new housing programs that will ostensibly compete and maybe conflict with the CMDA program, and with little explanation as to how the revised package of programs should work together.
A non-transparent process that led to poor drafting
Simply put, the new Act is replete with provisions that are confusing at best and others that, while relatively clear, display misunderstandings of existing Connecticut land-use law and establish new standards and procedures that will conflict with existing statutes, caselaw, and practice.
How did this happen? After the proposed text of the new Act was introduced at the November 2025 special session as House Bill 8002 (the bill vetoed by the Gov, Ned Lamont in June 2025 was House Bill 5002), the proponents tried to justify its immediate adoption, without public hearings or time for vetting the text, by explaining that the legislature had held numerous hearings on an array of housing issues during the 2025 regular session.  But this fact does not justify House Bill 8002 being made public on November 7 and then, under an “emergency certification,” voted on just days later.
Though no one in leadership has said so, the apparent emergency was avoiding giving opponents of the bill time to pick at it line by line, section by section.  Also, H.B. 8002, 53 sections and 107 pages, was not introduced as an amendment to H.B. 5002 but as a brand new document, such that comparing H.B. 8002 to H.B. 5002, much less in five days, was essentially impossible.   So, the new Act did not receive any public hearings or review of its wording.  As a result, the Act contains errors, misstatements, and several provisions that conflict with existing law and create impossible standards.
We intend no disrespect to the drafters.  They had a tough job.  Our point is that the final product could have been vastly improved with time for scrutiny.
Program notes
The good parts of the Act are mainly the holdovers from H.B. 5002 –provisions that were not the reasons for the governor’s June 2025 veto.  These provisions recognize that our affordable housing crisis has many facets and requires multiple approaches.
As you are reading this, most of the Act’s provisions are already in effect, adopted “from passage” on November 26 or effective January 1, 2026. Effective from passage are the sections creating the new Council on Housing Development; committees to study the § 8-30g Ten Percent List and sewer/wastewater policies; a pilot program of mobile showers and laundry facilities for the homeless; and priority access to environmental remediation funding for municipalities that adopt zoning regulations allowing conversion of commercial building to residential use.  
The only provisions delayed to July 1, 2026 are revisions to General Statutes § 8-2s regarding conversion of land zoned commercial or mixed-use to “transit community middle housing,” and the new standards for parking in residential developments.
On the other hand, a defining feature of the new Act is its extended timelines, in the form of far-out or unstated deadlines.  Future guidance on multiple matters will be issued by the Office of Policy and Management (OPM) and the Department of Housing (DOH).  The all-important housing growth plans will not be filed until 2028 and 2029.
Another notable point is the dispersion of authority over housing development to OPM instead of DOH.  It is hard to discern the basis for this shift, but going forward, OPM will be more of a major player in affordable housing development than previously.  This feature is also curious because, of course, a central theme of the governor’s office in 2025 was that municipalities, not the state, should “take the lead” in planning and zoning for affordable housing. In fact, while the Act does not force municipalities to adopt zoning regulations, overall the Act creates pervasive state agency oversight of the supposedly voluntary local and regional programs it introduces.
When reviewing our summaries below, the reader should pay attention to several provisions that address just “housing,” not specifically subsidized or affordable housing.  This may be a subtle shift forced by opponents of the prior bill’s tight focus on affordable units.
The Act contains 53 sections, but because most are now in effect and being codified into the General Statutes, we have included only minimal references to sections and subsections.
Finally, please bear in mind the variety of audiences we are addressing in these articles.  Many in local government and the development community need to understand the at-times-eyewatering procedural details, so we have tried to strike a balance between being complete and accurate but not going overboard with minutia.
Changes to existing housing programs
The Act makes these improvements to existing programs:

For the homeless population, creating a two-year pilot program of mobile vans with showers and health care service; and a permanent ban on “hostile architecture,” meaning physical obstacles that prevent the homeless from sitting or resting (Sections 23 and 26);
Modifying of rental assistance and voucher programs, including allowing non-profit entities to administer such programs and expanding the geographic areas where households use financial assistance (Section 28, 29);
Additional protections of renters and tenants in the eviction process (Sections 37-39);
Requiring about 30 cities and towns with a population between 15,000 and 25,000 to establish a fair rent commission or join a multi-town or regional commission (Section 35);
Extending existing protection of mobile manufactured homes and mobile home parks from zoning regulations that treat them differently from single-family, multi-family, and cluster housing, to homes narrower than 22 feet wide, provided that the home is built in compliance with federal safety standards (Section 18);
Banning the use of certain formulas and algorithms to calculate or set rents (Section 32);
Requiring additional reporting by municipal housing authorities about such matters as rental prices in relation to household income (Section 44); and
Authorizing the State Attorney General’s office to enforce the state’s fair housing and anti-discrimination laws in the same manner as the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities (CHRO) (Section 31).

Financial programs
The Act’s primary financial incentive is a grants-in-aid program administered by OPM to assist municipalities with costs of housing-related construction and infrastructure (Section 15).  However, no amount of funding has been specified, and OPM will issue details at some unspecified later time.  To be eligible for grants, a municipality must be in compliance with its housing growth plan or its regional council plan (to be explained in Part Three of this series); have in place a development agreement with the Connecticut Municipal Development Authority; or “meet additional criteria” to be developed by OPM.
Every good Act needs a “sleeper” provision, a section that seems innocuous but could have outsized impact.  The Act adds to the public school construction cost reimbursement program a five percentage point increase if the municipality is in compliance with its municipal or regional housing growth plan; has qualified as a transit-oriented community under the Act; or has entered into a development agreement with the CMDA.  If the school construction cost is, for example, $50 million, five percent could be a substantial financial incentive (Section 46).
In addition, the Act contains:

A modest income tax credit, based on household income limits, for first-time home buyers (Sections 1-3);
Expansion of CHFA’s Smart Rate Pilot Interest Rate Reduction Program, to provide additional help to mortgage borrowers (Section 36);
Additional funds for regional planning agencies to help them provide technical help with planning, development, stormwater control, and flood management (Section 30);
Direction to the DOH to establish an Affordable Housing Real Estate Investment Trust pilot program, to provide grants to municipalities with a population of 130,000 to 140,000, which apparently means New Haven and Stamford (Section 43);
Authorization to OPM to provide grants to regional councils of government to support public transit, bicycle, and pedestrian infrastructure (Section 25);
Direction to the DOH to establish a program by which union pension funds may “coinvest” in affordable housing development and thereby “create employment opportunities in the construction industry” (Section 34); and
DOH also is given new authority to make grants to municipalities of less than 50,000 for development of middle housing (Section 27).

Land use procedural reform
The Act eliminates the two-thirds “supermajority vote” provision that kicks in if adjacent property owners file a so-called “protest petition” to oppose a zone change application (these petitions are an antiquated exclusionary zoning tool), in favor of a simple majority vote (as is otherwise now required of all zone change applications), and an increase in the minimum amount of land abutting the zone change that the protest petitioners must own in order to file, from 20 to 50 percent (Section 24).  
The Act also clarifies which municipal body can vote to opt out of the 2021 standards for accessory apartments (Section 22).
Further study
The Act establishes two committees that will file reports in the 2026 legislative session and could be very important to affordable housing.  
The first is an interagency task force to study the state’s wastewater and sewer programs and the powers of municipal sewer commissions (Section 33).  Sewers are a well-established and frequently-used mechanism to prevent multi-family and affordable housing development, so this group has an opportunity to curb misuse of sewers to block housing.  
Second is a committee to study the § 8-30g “Ten Percent List,” by which DOH counts each municipality’s total affordable housing stock and exempts from § 8-30g those with more than ten percent affordable (Section 42).  
It seems inevitable that every municipality that wants to be shielded from § 8-30g application without having to produce any new housing will descend on this committee and argue that the current system has “failed” and/or is unfair. The committee should resist this pressure.  
The Ten Percent List was established in the original 1989 § 8-30g legislation to exempt about 30 of our 169 towns that had the highest percentages of existing affordable, deed-restricted, or subsidized units.  The ten percent threshold is, of course, a policy-driven number, but it has worked as intended for 35 years.  This committee should dismiss the naysayers who assert that other towns, not theirs, should shoulder the responsibility for affordable housing. 
Tim Hollister and Andrea Gomes are land use attorneys at the Hartford office of Hinckley Allen.  They both work regularly on affordable housing development.  
In 2022-23, Hollister co-chaired a statewide working group tasked by the legislature with reviewing all of the affordable housing plans (so-called “§ 8-30j plans”) prepared by nearly all municipalities and providing recommendations on how such plans could be improved.  In September 2024, he published here a five-part series about affordable housing reform and in July 2025, a two-part series explaining House Bill 5002, the one vetoed by the governor in June 2025, and what could be done to fix it.
Gomes regularly represents clients before local and state agencies and in state court. She has assisted with obtaining municipal approvals and litigating affordable housing matters and property disputes such as quiet title actions, easement disputes, nuisance actions, and adverse possession cases. 
Attorney Raphael Podolsky also contributed to this series.

But over the last decade, Connecticut’s largest cities have repeatedly demonstrated that our system is far too vulnerable to manipulation — especially when it comes to absentee ballots.
Bridgeport has become the national poster child for absentee-ballot abuse. Surveillance footage showing individuals depositing stacks of ballots into drop boxes during a contested mayoral primary forced a court to order a do-over election — a stunning acknowledgment that the integrity of the process had been compromised. That case produced multiple arrests and over a hundred criminal counts, including allegations of unlawful possession of absentee ballots and organized ballot “harvesting.”

Timothy Herbst

Stamford has seen its own high-profile failures. A years-long investigation into the 2015 municipal election revealed forged absentee-ballot applications and ballots. A former Democratic city chairman was convicted of multiple felonies; a former city clerk faced penalties for improper handling of ballots. These were not technical violations — they were deliberate abuses carried out by individuals entrusted with civic responsibility.
New Haven has faced documented cases involving fraudulent petition signatures and campaign-related election crimes, adding yet another layer to the pattern of misconduct in Connecticut’s urban political machines.
What ties these incidents together is not geography, but method. Time after time, the abuses involve absentee ballots — and most often, party operatives and campaign workers who handle ballots they shouldn’t. The public record speaks plainly: in the cities where ballot fraud has been documented, it has overwhelmingly involved local Democratic organizations and political insiders who exploited weak rules and minimal enforcement.
This isn’t about partisanship. It’s about honesty. And honesty requires acknowledging that Connecticut’s current laws do not deter organized schemes. When the worst offenders face fines or probation, not jail time, it sends a clear message: the risk is worth it, and the consequences are tolerable.
If Connecticut is serious about restoring election integrity, we need to strengthen absentee-ballot laws — and we must finally adopt a statewide voter ID requirement.
Voter ID is a necessary part of the solution
For all the debate, the truth is straightforward: the cities that have seen the most documented election abuses are the ones with the least safeguards. A uniform, statewide voter ID law — requiring a simple, government-issued photo ID at the polls — would bring Connecticut in line with the overwhelming majority of states and close one more avenue for misrepresentation.
Most Americans, including majorities of Democrats, Independents, and Republicans, support voter ID. It protects honest voters without stopping eligible voters from participating. If we are tightening absentee-ballot rules, it makes no sense to leave our in-person voting rules unchanged. Integrity requires consistency.
Five reforms Connecticut must enact now

Strengthen penalties for unlawful ballot possession and organized “harvesting.”Repeated or coordinated handling of absentee ballots should be a felony with real prison exposure, not a fine or suspended sentence.
Ban third-party ballot collection except for narrow categories of authorized agents. If a ballot leaves a voter’s hands, there must be a clear, provable chain of custody — no exceptions, no gray zones.
Require rapid referral of evidence to prosecutors. When the State Elections Enforcement Commission identifies likely misconduct, the case should move to the Chief State’s Attorney within 30 days, with mandatory evidence preservation.
Create enhanced penalties for public employees and officials who abuse their office. When registrars, clerks, or municipal employees engage in ballot misconduct, the law should mandate immediate suspension and heightened criminal penalties.
Secure ballot drop boxes and improve public notice.  Drop boxes should be monitored, alarmed, and clearly marked with warnings that illegal ballot collection is a crime. Public education must be proactive, not reactive.

The stakes could not be higher
Democracy is not self-enforcing. It relies on rules we trust and institutions we believe in. When voters in Bridgeport, Stamford, or New Haven see ballots mishandled, forged, or collected illegally, confidence collapses — not just in those cities, but statewide.
Connecticut cannot keep treating each scandal as an isolated event. The pattern is real, the damage is cumulative, and the public’s patience is running out. Strengthening absentee-ballot laws, adopting voter ID, and imposing meaningful penalties are not partisan measures. They are basic safeguards needed to ensure that every voter — regardless of party or ZIP code — can trust that their vote counts exactly once, and only once.
If we wait for the next scandal, it will be too late. The legislature should act now.

Since President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20, ICE arrests have soared in Maryland and across the country. (Photo by Immigration and Customs Enforcement)The GoFundMe page Julia Leverone created in February for legal fees and bond payments to get Minoska Maldonado-Deras out of Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody was successful, helping to get her out of custody and back with her family in Carroll County.
That’s until Maldonado-Deras, a cousin of Leverone’s husband, was hauled back into  custody during an appointment with ICE in October. She’s now in an ICE detention facility in Lousiana, and the GoFundMe page is back in business.
Maldonado-Deras was “doing everything she was supposed to do” following her first detainment, said her husband, Patrick Sortino, including probation meetings with ICE.
Sortino, a U.S. citizen, says he doesn’t have “any straight answers,” about what will happen to his wife, whether she will be granted bail or deported to Honduras — her native country that she has not been to in nearly 20 years.
“This was her new life, you know — here,” Sortino said. “We were hoping to spend the holidays together.”
Maldonado-Deras is one of the more 3,200 people in Maryland who were arrested by ICE from Jan. 21, 2025, the day after President Donald Trump returned to office, through Oct. 15, 2025. The data comes from the Deportation Data Project.
What comes after the ICE arrest video?

All told, ICE had arrested 3,308 people in Maryland from Jan. 1 to Oct.15, 2025, the last date that for which the Deportation Data Project provided numbers. That compares to 1,353 for all of 2024 and 387 for the last four months of 2023, according to the data.
ICE did not respond to Maryland Matters’ request for data.
Only one-third (1,073) of those arrested in Maryland had criminal convictions, and 50.9% (1,652) had no criminal charges whatsoever. The remaining 519 have or had criminal charges pending at the time of their detention.
“The administration comes out promising to deport millions and millions of illegal criminals, and what they’ve done instead is started picking up moms and grandfathers … who have no criminal convictions,” said Ben Messer, a senior immigration attorney at Wilkes Legal.
Nearly all of those detained originally went to holding rooms or field offices in Maryland, most often in Baltimore, with many then transferred to out-of-state locations — some being thousands of miles away.
Messer says there are more people asking for help since the Trump administration took over in January, but the ways that attorneys are able to help are dwindling because of the administration “closing off areas of relief.”
“Some people who would have had a case before are going to be unable to succeed under drastic changes in interpretation of law,” Messer said. “The cases that do remain are just quite a bit more difficult for the same reason.”
BWI protests fell short, but airline will still end deportation flights

There has been a “bloodbath” of immigration court judges due to actions by the Board of Immigration Appeals and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Messer said. Judges who have previously represented immigrants or worked at pro-immigrant organizations have been fired, he said, with some of them being replaced by military lawyers.
“We have a few of these temporary immigration judges now in our area — the DMV [D.C., Maryland, Virginia] — and they’ve supposedly gotten a crash course in immigration law, but none of them have any experience in it,” Messer said.
Messer noted that the Board of Immigration Appeals and Bondi’s decision to overturn “decades of practice and precedent” by determining that anyone who came to the U.S. without a visa does not have bond eligibility — a decision which many federal courts have rejected — as one of the new challenges.
The Justice Department, in a statement, disagreed with Messer’s assessment, saying the new interpretations of the law are common sense.
“The Executive Office for Immigration Review is restoring integrity to the immigration adjudication system, and Board of Immigration Appeals decisions reflect straightforward interpretations of clear statutory language,” a Justice Department spokesperson said in a statement.
“President Trump and the Department of Justice will continue to enforce the law as it is written to defend and protect the safety and security of the American people,” the statement said.

(Photo courtesy EPA Clean Air Markets)Montgomery County is about to make one of the most important environmental and public health decisions in decades: How to manage our municipal solid waste, whether to continue burning it at the Dickerson incinerator or transition to sending it to a vetted regional landfill.
This choice will shape our public health, climate goals, environmental justice commitments and the county’s ability to reduce total waste for years to come.
To make the best decision, we need a full and accurate picture of the impacts. The recent Friends of Sligo Creek report (SCR) presents only part of that picture and overlooks key facts. Having worked with the county as a community advocate for over 10 years, I hope to clarify those gaps so we can choose the option that does the least harm.
Solid waste management is complex. Responsible decisions require accurate comparisons of risks and benefits, something the SCR did not provide. I contributed to a comprehensive report  – Beyond Incineration – commissioned by the county executive that evaluated all available waste management options using a peer-reviewed life cycle analysis (MEBCalc) with public health and environmental justice criteria to identify the least-harm option. Many of the SCR’s conclusions do not align with those findings. Find a point-by-point review of this report here.

The SCR notes that the incinerator meets all but one EPA limit for emissions. This is not accurate. First, with regard to greenhouse gases, there are NO limits on carbon dioxide from incinerators in federal regs and there are no scrubbers in place.
Regarding toxic emissions, our incinerator not only exceeds the EPA limits for hydrogen chloride, it produces more than double the nitrogen oxides that any new incinerator would have to meet. Even more alarmingly, a Nov. 11 report by the incinerator operator, Reworld, revealed that the annual stack test showed dioxin and furan levels nearly double EPA limits. These are two of the deadliest substances known to science – there is no safe established limit. These toxins could have been streaming undetected into our airshed for the past 12 months.
For the rest, “meeting limits” does not mean our incinerator’s emissions are safe. The report relies on older studies to suggest the incinerator’s toxic emissions pose “negligible” health risk. Current health science recognizes the danger of cumulative exposure from multiple pollution sources.
The SCR also does not compare the incinerator directly to modern landfills. Our incinerator emits far more toxic pollutants — including mercury, dioxins, sulfur dioxide, arsenic, beryllium, lead, nitrogen oxides and fine particulate matter — than the landfills evaluated in the county’s study.
On environmental justice, the report raises concerns about landfills nationally but does not note that the Montgomery County report evaluated 42 regional landfills and found five that met every equity and performance criterion. We emit approximately 600,000 tons of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) annually. The top 10 landfills the Beyond Incineration report vetted emit an average of half that, much of which is methane. Gas capture rates would have to go as low as 30% for CO2e to be close to the incinerator’s. With health and environmental impacts added, not just climate impacts, incineration is still worse than landfilling even if there is 0% gas capture (see chart here).
The SCR also suggests keeping waste disposal “close to home.” While proximity can matter, it should not outweigh health and safety. The incinerator’s emissions affect communities near the facility and downwind. We send more than 150,000 tons of toxic ash each year to a majority-Black community outside Richmond, Virginia. Ceasing incineration would end this burden for both communities.
Vetted landfills pose the lowest pollution and toxic exposure risks for both Montgomery County and the receiving community.
Notably, Montgomery County is not planning to rely on landfilling alone. The county is already piloting countywide food-scrap composting and Save-As-You-Throw pricing. These strategies will significantly reduce the volume of waste ultimately buried. Thus, landfilling is part of a structured transition to significantly reduce waste overall and reduce costs. A Department of Environmental Protection report in July showed that moving to straight landfill will have slightly increased costs in the first year, but over the following years costs will drop considerably.
After years of study, the county concluded that closing the incinerator and using well-vetted landfills while expanding waste-reduction programs reduces toxic emissions, lowers climate impacts, protects vulnerable communities and aligns with long-term sustainability goals. I applaud our county leaders for moving toward a solution based on current science, best practices in waste management, modern health research, and a commitment to fairness for all communities touched by our waste disposal system.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/52469466397_e9d1353222_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-12 06:12:23.844289

Jerrod Baetsch stood with an American flag upside down — a sign of distress — as a north wind blew in the face of protesters lining a Red River bridge connecting Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota. 
“To stay at home felt useless,” Baetsch said of joining Saturday’s protest of the shooting of Renee Good, a mother who was killed Wednesday by Jonathan Ross, an ICE agent in Minneapolis.

The demonstrations follow thousands of ICE agents deployed to neighboring Minnesota. Good’s wife, Rebecca Good, told the Washington Post they were supporting neighbors before the ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good. Video of the incident shows Renee Good’s vehicle blocking traffic and ICE officers approaching the vehicle, with one officer ordering her to exit her vehicle. Ross fired as Good pulled the vehicle forward.
Baetsch said any actions by Good in her vehicle did not justify the use of deadly force. 
The crowd observed a moment of silence for Good after gathering near a Statue of Liberty replica on the Fargo end of the Veterans Memorial Bridge.

Speaking to the crowd, Colby Montigue of Fargo, urged people to continue to protest, organize and run for office. 
“This doesn’t stop until we do the work,” said Montigue, a member of the Red River Valley Democratic Socialists of America. 
Minnesota officials announced Friday they’re collecting evidence in an investigation of the shooting and are asking the public to submit information.
In Bismarck, demonstrators lined Boulevard Avenue on Sunday to rally outside the Capitol during an event called ICE Out for Good.
Cherie Schumacher, a volunteer organizer for Missouri River Indivisible, said there were a lot of hateful comments made on social media ahead of the Bismarck event, to the point that “it was actually kind of scary to go.”
Most people driving by had positive responses, Schumacher said, except for someone who drove by and fired what she described as foam BBs at participants as the event was ending. Schumacher said she was hit in the shoulder and someone else was hit in the back.
“They were just these little tiny foam things, so there was no harm to us,” she said. “But it’s sending a message anytime someone points anything at you to target you.”

The predawn fire Saturday reduced the Beth Israel Congregation’s library and administrative offices to charred ruins and left smoke damage throughout the building. The destruction occurred in the same part of the building that was damaged when Ku Klux Klan members bombed the temple in 1967 because of the rabbi’s outspoken support of civil rights. 
Local and federal law enforcement made an arrest Saturday night after the suspect was found at a Jackson hospital with burns that were not life-threatening, said Charles Felton, a chief investigator with the Jackson Fire Department.

The fire was ruled an arson, meaning it was intentionally set. By Sunday afternoon, law enforcement had not released the suspect’s name, the exact charges he will face or a possible motive. It was not immediately clear whether investigators consider this a hate crime. 
A Mississippi Today reporter watched a segment of the congregation’s security-camera footage only hours before the arrest was announced Saturday. It showed a person wearing a hooded shirt and a mask over most of his face. The person was holding what appears to be a plastic container while dousing the inside of the lobby with liquid, including a wall adorned with the synagogue’s Tree of Life, an installation that marks special occasions for congregants such as bar and bat mitzvahs.
The video footage has become part of a joint federal, state and local investigation.

The fire was reported shortly after 3 a.m. Saturday, and firefighters extinguished it before sunrise. No congregants or firefighters were injured.
Beth Israel’s congregation president, Zach Shemper, said in a statement Sunday that damage assessment continues, and several churches have extended offers for Beth Israel congregants to use their buildings for worship space. He said the congregation has established a donation fund for rebuilding, with a link on the congregation’s website.
“We are a resilient people,” Shemper said. “With support from our community, we will rebuild.”
Jewish congregations have been attacked in the U.S. in the past several years, including in Pittsburgh, the San Diego area and Colleyville, Texas. The attacks have come amid a rise in  anti-Semitic rhetoric in public spaces and on social media.
News of the fire at Beth Israel prompted an outpouring of support from the Jackson metro area, including from Mayor John Horhn and local religious leaders.
The Rev. CJ Rhodes, pastor of Mount Helm Baptist Church in downtown Jackson, said on social media Sunday that Beth Israel Congregation “holds a sacred place in Jackson’s moral history” because of its courageous support of the Civil Rights Movement. 
Rhodes also said that attacks on houses of worship “strike at the heart of our shared moral life.” He called on people to pray for the Beth Israel Congregation and stand in solidarity with them.
“An injury to one faith community is a concern for us all,” Rhodes said.

Mississippi also has a history of bombings at Black churches. Those reached a peak during the Civil Rights Movement, including the June 1964 arson of Mount Zion Church in Neshoba County — a Ku Klux Klan conspiracy that drew civil rights workers Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman to the area to investigate the fire. 
Chaney was Black, and Goodman and Schwerner were Jewish. After the three young men were jailed a few hours in Philadelphia on an accusation that Chaney was speeding, they were released. Waiting Klansmen chased them on a rural highway, pulled them over and shot them to death. 
Beth Israel is Jackson’s only synagogue, with about 150 families. The congregation does not have a count of individual members but says a family could be one person or multiple people.

Two Torahs were destroyed and five were damaged in the flames that erupted during Shabbat, the weekly Jewish day of rest, according to temple leaders. One Torah that survived the Holocaust was in a glass case and was undamaged in the fire.
The day after the fire, Beth Israel held children’s Sunday school at a museum in Jackson. 
News of the fire drew international attention, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center is among several groups condemning the attack. 
“We owe gratitude to law enforcement for their swift response, and to civic and religious leaders from other faiths who made it clear that the Jewish community would not stand alone,” the center’s CEO, Jim Berk said in a statement Sunday. “Their leadership is a signal that hate will be met head-on, not met with silence.”

Four different Salesianum players scored in double figures defeating the Buccaneers, 80-71, Friday night.
 
WILMINGTON — With just over four minutes to play in the third quarter, Salesianum freshman Braelin Sosa stole the ball and drove toward the basket. A pair of defenders stopped his momentum forcing him to pass to the top of the key where senior Dominic Downs was awaiting the pass. Downs caught the pass and knocked down his third three-pointer of the game giving Sallies a 19-point lead they never relinquished. 
Salesianum handed Caravel its first loss of the season defeating the Buccaneers, 80-71, January 9 at Birkenheuer Memorial Gymnasium. 
The Buccaneers bounced back following Downs’ three-pointer by scoring six straight points to cut into the Sallies lead. The Sals ended the quarter on a 7-2 scoring run bumping their lead to 17 points going into the final frame.
At the start of the fourth quarter, Caravel mounted another strong comeback attempt. Junior Niquon Lee scored the first seven points of the quarter hitting shots from all three levels of the court. Lee started the fourth quarter with a three from the left corner, moved into the mid-range for his next bucket and then scored at the rim to cut the Sallies lead to ten. A steal and fastbreak score by senior Michael Sheehan brought the Salesianum lead to single digits for the first time since early in the third quarter. 
Salesianum senior Latrell Wright ended the 9-0 Caravel run with a right handed layup getting the score through a foul. Wright made the free throw, increasing the Sallies lead back to double figures. 
Like it was for most of the game, the fourth quarter moved quickly with both teams getting good looks at the basket. The Buccaneers cut the Sallies lead down to eight with a little over a minute remaining, but a strong performance from Salesianum at the free throw line — six for eight in the last 1:30 — kept Caravel from earning its ninth victory of the season and continuing its undefeated start to the year.
Downs finished as Sallies’ leading scorer with 17 points on three made three-pointers. Fellow seniors Kevin Coleman and Mark Brown finished in double figures along with freshman Braelin Sosa who ended with ten points. Lee was the game’s leading scorer with 20 points, eight of those coming in the fourth quarter. Sheehan finished the game with 16 points along with sophomore Prince McKnight.
Sallies will play twice next week taking on Middletown on Tuesday before returning for a two game home stand that begins on Friday against Odessa.

He was 79.
Codey’s family announced the news on Facebook, calling him “a beloved husband, father and grandfather.”
“New Jersey lost a remarkable public servant who touched the lives of all who knew him,” they said.
Codey, a Democrat, retired from the New Jersey Legislature in January 2024, capping 50 years as a member of the body representing parts of Essex County. He was first elected to the state Assembly in 1973 and became a state senator in 1982. He served as acting governor starting in 2004 following the resignation of Gov. Jim McGreevey, and again for nearly a month when Gov. Jon Corzine was injured in a car crash in 2007.
Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) called Codey “a remarkable public servant.”
“Dick Codey lived his life with humility, compassion and a deep sense of responsibility. He spoke the truth when others wouldn’t and he fought tirelessly to improve the lives of the people of New Jersey during his record-setting 50 years of service in the Legislature and as Governor. He gained the trust and respect of other public officials and made friends with Presidents just as easily as he did with strangers in all-night diners,” Scutari said.
Sen. Anthony Bucco (R-Morris), the Senate’s minority leader, said he is “heartbroken” over the loss.
“We worked together on many important issues that helped move New Jersey forward, and I came to know him as a true friend and someone who led with humility, kindness, and humor. He leaves behind a lasting legacy of service and integrity that will be felt for generations. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and all those whose lives he touched during this very difficult time,” Bucco said.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s top law enforcement official wants lawmakers to stiffen penalties for selling drugs in prison and making deepfake pornography, to create consumer protections for DNA data, and to give internet crime investigators swifter access to suspects’ user data.
Those bills are among the 10 proposed by Attorney General Marty Jackley for the 2026 legislative session that begins Tuesday at the Capitol in Pierre.
In a news release Wednesday, Jackley said the package “focuses on many issues this office has dealt with in the past year” and that he looks forward to “working with the governor and legislators during the session on these important opportunities to protect South Dakota.”
Lawmakers have endorsed most of Jackley’s proposals during each legislative session since his ascent to a second stint as attorney general in the 2022 general election.
Some proposals have seen tweaks, however, including one in 2025 that attempted to affix felony penalties for the failure of state employee supervisors to report employee misconduct. Lawmakers passed that bill, but ultimately opted for misdemeanor penalties.
Here are summaries of this year’s proposals.
Senate Bill 17: Foreign political donations
This bill would bar political candidates in South Dakota from accepting donations from foreign nationals. It aims to amend an existing law that prohibits campaign contributions from states, state agencies, foreign governments, federal agencies or the federal government. One violation could net a year in jail and a $2,000 fine. Two or more violations in a single year could draw up to two years in prison.
Senate Bill 41: Deepfakes
This bill targets “deepfake” pornography, created with digital technology to resemble a real person without that person’s consent. The bill would amend an existing law, adding a definition of “digitally fabricated material” and making it a crime to “create, disclose, disseminate, distribute, or sell” such material when it depicts a nonconsenting person in a “state of nudity,” or engaged in any manner of sexual act.
Senate Bill 42: Prison drugs
Currently, possession of controlled substances in prison — by inmates or staff members — is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. This bill would up the penalty to a maximum of 15 years. The bill would also update the state’s drug ingestion statutes to make it a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison, for an inmate or parolee to fail a drug test for controlled substances. Ingestion of a controlled substance was a felony for everyone until last year, when lawmakers voted to make first- and second-offense ingestion a misdemeanor. Jackley opposed that move.
Senate Bill 43: Digital currency seizures
Currently, law enforcement is empowered to seize money and property with suspected ties to felony crimes during criminal investigations. This bill would add “digital currency” like Bitcoin to law enforcement’s list of assets seizable during criminal investigations.
Senate Bill 44: Internet crimes
This bill would let the attorney general or a designee ask a Hughes County judge to subpoena information on internet users suspected of crimes against children or human trafficking. Hughes County judges would be able to issue those subpoenas regardless of where a crime took place, where the suspect’s internet service provider might be located, or where the subpoena would be enforced. The multi-agency Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force is headquartered in Pierre, which is in Hughes County.
Senate Bill 45: Marijuana-like intoxicants
Selling products made with the marijuana-like intoxicant known as delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (Delta-9 THC-A on product labels) to anyone younger than 21 could draw up to two years in prison under the terms of this bill. Buying THC-A products for or sharing them with a person under 21 would also be forbidden. Other products containing pot-like compounds, including Delta-8 THC or THC-O, are already covered by the provisions of the law SB 45 seeks to amend.
Senate Bill 46: Public meeting agendas
This bill would require agendas for open public meetings to list every item to be discussed. Each agenda item would also need to be “described in sufficient detail to reasonably inform the public of any official business or public policy intended to be considered at the meeting.” Violations would be punishable by up to 30 days in jail and a $500 fine.
Senate Bill 47: Closed sessions of public meetings
This bill would revise the rules for closed-door executive sessions during public meetings. It would add a handful of items, such as discussions of cybersecurity and talk of ammunition locations, to the list of acceptable reasons to go into executive session. The bill would also require that votes to enter an executive session and the section of law justifying the session be logged in the meeting minutes. Violations could draw up to 30 days in jail and a $500 fine.
Senate Bill 48: Advance meeting notices
This bill would “clarify” that agendas for public meetings of state agencies or commissions must be posted online 72 hours in advance of a meeting, not counting Saturdays, Sundays or legal holidays. Current law requires a 72-hour notice at the “principal office of the board, commission, or department holding the meeting” but doesn’t specify the timing for posting an online agenda. Violations of the law could draw up to 30 days in jail and a $500 fine.
Senate Bill 49: DNA data
This one is designed to protect consumer privacy as it relates to DNA data. It says that any person or organization that collects DNA has to spell out privacy policies and tell consumers upfront if their DNA will be shared with any partner organization. It would be illegal to share or sell DNA data to others without the express consent of the person who provided it, unless the data is “de-identified” and shared for research purposes alone. DNA collectors would also be required to let people access their own data and delete it upon request. Violations could draw civil penalties of up to $5,000 per violation. The rules wouldn’t apply for colleges, research institutions or forensic laboratories, or to data collected for medical purposes.

Linda McMahon, the nation’s secretary of education, says public schools are failing.
In November, she promised a “hard reset” of the system in which more than 80% of U.S. children learn. But rather than invest in public education, she has been working to dismantle the Department of Education and enact wholesale changes to how public schools operate.
“Our final mission as a department is to fully empower states to carry the torch of our educational renaissance,” she said at a November press conference.
To help her carry out these and other goals, McMahon has brought at least 20 advisers from ultraconservative think tanks and advocacy groups who share her skepticism of the value of public education and seek deep changes, including instilling Christian values into public schools.
ProPublica reporters Jennifer Smith Richards and Megan O’Matz spent months reporting and reviewing dozens of hours of video to understand the ideals and ambitions of those pulling the levers of power in federal education policy. They found a concerted push to shrink public school systems by steering taxpayer dollars to private, religious and charter schools, as well as options like homeschooling. The Education Department did not respond to a detailed list of questions from ProPublica.
They also found top officials expressing a vision for the remaining public schools that rejects the separation of church and state and promotes a pro-America vision of history, an “uplifting portrayal of the nation’s founding ideals.” Critics argue the “patriotic” curricula downplay the legacy of slavery and paper over episodes of discrimination.
Since its establishment in 1979, the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights has served as an enforcer of anti-discrimination laws in schools and colleges around the country. It’s the place parents turn to when they believe their schools failed to protect children from discrimination or to provide access to an equal education under the law.
The Trump administration laid off much of the office’s staff in its first months and prioritized investigations into schools that allegedly discriminated against white and Jewish students and accommodated transgender students. McMahon and the department have framed this as a course correction in line with efforts to be more efficient and curb diversity, equity and inclusion policies from prior administrations. It has left little recourse for those seeking to defend the rights of students with disabilities, students of color and those facing sex discrimination.

(Photo by Tom Banse)The days might be numbered for your next Puget Sound ferry ride to be a fleeting offline oasis, free from the incessant demands of email, pop-up ads and doomscrolling. 
Washington State Ferries is yielding to requests from commuters for internet access, which the state Legislature heard and turned into an order for a Wi-Fi pilot project.
In a newly published report to the Legislature, the ferry system laid out its plans for a limited trial of free Wi-Fi at one terminal (Bremerton) and on one ferry, the Chimacum. Installation of antennas and routers is slated for this spring to facilitate a Wi-Fi test period during the summer.
Traveler demand and reviews, along with the availability of future state funding, will determine if a wider rollout happens. The ferry system offered pay-to-use Wi-Fi hotspots previously, but discontinued that partnership in 2016 due to poor performance and low uptake. 
“The public expects to have internet access,” Poulsbo Mayor Becky Erickson wrote in a letter to the head of Washington State Ferries more than a year ago. “For many individuals, internet access is crucial for carrying out their daily tasks efficiently. The absence of internet access on ferries or the Bainbridge Island terminal decreases productivity.”
Cellular data signals sometimes drop out in the middle of the Sound. WSF reported there are also dead zones around bends in Rich Passage on the Seattle-Bremerton route. The San Juan Islands also suffer from cell service dead zones.
The city manager of Bainbridge Island sent in a nearly identical letter after getting unanimous backing from the city council. Similar sentiments filtered up to the state Senate through Kitsap County’s legislators. The result was a 2025 transportation budget proviso that directed the ferry system to give public Wi-Fi another try.
“We do want people to be able to work from the boat if that’s important to them,” explained Senate Transportation Committee Chair Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, in an interview last week.
However, the legislative directive to the ferry system had a catch. It said to carry out the new Wi-Fi pilot project “within existing resources,” which meant no extra money. Thus, the cash-strapped agency told lawmakers this winter it had to focus the tryout on one terminal and one vessel.
“Bremerton is strategically selected because it represents one of the system’s longest sailings, where customer demand for internet connectivity is likely higher, and where the physical layout of the terminal provides a manageable platform for initial installation,” the WSF project outline said.
The ferry Chimacum was chosen not only because it serves Bremerton, but because it has a scheduled maintenance layup in March that aligns nicely to do the hotspot installation with minimal extra disruption.
Technology choices
Satellite-based internet provider Starlink is making rapid inroads with airlines and major cruise lines based on having stable and fast service. The Alaska Marine Highway System recently chose Starlink to provide internet connectivity on the ferry assigned to the Bellingham-Southeast Alaska route.
Starlink has a rising Washington-grown competitor in Amazon Leo, another satellite-based internet vendor. But neither of these two companies will be considered for the ferryboat Wi-Fi deployment on Puget Sound this year. 
“For the first phase of this pilot, we are focusing on cellular data connectivity rather than satellite-based internet. Cellular connectivity is significantly more cost-effective,” ferry system spokesman Justin Fujioka said in an email. “Satellite-based solutions, such as low-Earth orbit providers, may be evaluated in the future.”
Fujioka added that the state’s ferries are equipped with commercial-grade antennas that are more powerful than consumer mobile devices. That could give the onboard Wi-Fi network a leg up over your personal cellular data plan, but Fujioka said slowdowns or brief dropouts could still happen. The ferry system’s previous, ultimately unsatisfying onboard Wi-Fi provider Boingo relied on terrestrial cellular data too, a decade ago.
The deployment schedule provided to the Legislature calls for free Wi-Fi to debut in May and last through August. In September, ferry workers expect to crunch the data on customer usage, technical performance and reliability.
Then they will toss the ball back to management and legislators to decide whether Wi-Fi will be offered permanently, and if so, whether to expand it across more terminals and vessels. A permanent Wi-Fi offering would not necessarily be free of charge. It could be tiered or subscription-based, WSF said.
A key legislator who holds sway over the ferry system budget said the estimated multi-million dollar price tag to roll out Wi-Fi systemwide caught his eye. State House Transportation Committee Chair Jake Fey, D-Tacoma, sounded skeptical about greenlighting big spending for new internet infrastructure and ongoing operational costs in light of all the other needs the beleaguered ferry system has.
“Given that it didn’t work before, I don’t think this would rate” for future funding, Fey said in an interview. “If this came back as uncertain that it would be profitable or break even, I would say another day, not now.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ferry-Chimacum-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-11 07:11:41.176244

One variation of an old saying goes, “If ifs and ands were pots and pans, there’d be no work for tinkers,” and another goes, “If a frog had wings he wouldn’t bump his backside when he jumps.”
Those sayings are meant to dissuade people from hypothesizing about an event that is not likely to happen.
They are adages for a reason. They hold elements of truth.
Despite the warnings established by those adages, it is still worth noting that if the Mississippi electorate follows the pattern established by voters in other states in recent elections – even in solidly Republican areas – the Mississippi contest for the U.S. Senate later this year could be closer than expected.
Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, a close ally of President Donald Trump, is a heavy favorite to win reelection this November and continue serving in the nation’s Capitol as Mississippi’s junior senator. Heck, a Democrat has not won a statewide election in Mississippi since Jim Hood garnered reelection as attorney general in 2015.
But in 10 special elections, granted district elections not state contests, held across the country since Dec. 9, Democrats have performed on average 13% better than they did in the previous elections in those same districts.
Even in statewide elections – gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia – the Democrat did better in 2025 than in the previous election in 2021– by 9.4% in Virginia and by 5.6% in New Jersey.
If (there is that word) the Democrat running against Hyde-Smith could do as well this November, the election would be exceedingly close and she could even lose.
In her last election in 2020, she defeated Democrat Mike Espy 54% to 44%. When the pair ran against each other in a special election in 2018 months after Hyde-Smith had been appointed to temporarily fill the Senate seat, Espy garnered 46.4% of the vote.

This time around, Lowndes District Attorney Scott Colom is the favorite to win the Democratic primary on March 10 and face Hyde-Smith in November. He faces opposition from Albert Littell and Priscilla W. Till. Hyde-Smith, for that matter, is being challenged in the Republican primary by Sarah Adlakha and Andrew Smith. 
Ty Pinkins, who has run for statewide office in the past as a Democrat, will be vying in the Senate contest in the November general election as an independent, creating an additional headwind for the Democratic nominee. 
Democrats have exceeded their performances in recent elections presumably because of voter disenchantment with Republican President Trump.

A key question is whether voters in Mississippi, where Trump has historically been popular, feel the same disenchantment?
Trump faces various headwinds right now. Many voters are still struggling with economic woes. Plus, Trump still faces questions concerning his closeness to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and the fact that the U.S. Department of Justice seems to be violating the law to slow-walk the release of files that perhaps could shed light on that relationship. Then, there are questions about Trump’s strange obsession with controlling or acquiring other countries, even making threats of military action against longtime allies.
And there is always the issue of his inappropriate comments regarding the deaths of people he did not like. 
Will all of those issues and others impact elections in Mississippi, like they have affected elections in other states?
Heck, even in Mississippi, there was at least one recent special election where the Democrat did much better than in past contests.
In a Nov.10  special election in state Senate District 19 in northwest Mississippi, incumbent Kevin Blackwell won by only 6.6%. In the 2023 regular election, Blackwell won by a sizable margin of 31.4%. Granted, Blackwell ran in 2025 in a new court-ordered district that increased the percentage of Black voters, who tend to vote Democratic, but the increase was minimal from 25.4% to 27.5%.
If (there is that word again) those election trends hold true, Hyde-Smith could be in for a challenge this November.

Can we be friends?
Abigail Ulager, 16, Hinesburg
Why don’t we become friends?
We can carry one another through storms,
and catch each other when we fall.
The only thing is:
I’m weak,
and no matter how much I want to lift you up,
I don’t think I can.
Never mind that,
we can still be friends.
We can shine lights when the clouds hide the sun,
and show each other that the shadows aren’t all that scary after all.
I’m scared of your shadows too,
and I don’t know how to light up the darkness.
Maybe we can’t be friends… 
because what’s the point of doing something
if it’s not going to be any good?
But she, with brown hair,
twinkled her bright eyes.  
I don’t remember what she said
as she gently took my hand;
all I know is that she smiled 
like we would never die.
So maybe I can’t carry you across the raging ocean, 
or make the blackness white –
you’ll need someone else for that.
I’m no doctor, 
and I don’t know how to make your wounds hurt less.
But I will be here
with open ears and open arms,
because I don’t know how to make it better
but I have a shoulder on which you can cry
and a heart that yearns to laugh.
So, can we be friends?
I don’t have much to offer,
and will probably mess up a billion times.
But I really want to stand here,
my hands holding on to yours 
and yours resting in mine.

(Photo by Aneri Pattani/KFF Health News)NEW ORLEANS — From the outside, the abandoned Family Dollar store in the Lower 9th Ward looks intimidating. It’s covered in graffiti, with aluminum cans and trash dotting the parking lot. It sits on a street with other empty lots and decayed buildings — symbols of the lasting devastation this neighborhood, one of the city’s poorest, has endured since Hurricane Katrina.
But inside, the store is a welcoming oasis. Twinkly string lights adorn racks of donated clothing. Shelves and bins overflow with children’s books, allergy medications, and toiletries. Curtains cordon off one side of the room, where there’s a stage for musicians and a neon sign depicting roller skates for weekly free skate nights.
The space is part free thrift store, part over-the-counter pharmacy, part punk show venue — and wholly “a radical community center,” said Dan Bingler, who runs the place.
Bingler is a waiter and bartender in the city who founded a mutual-aid organization called the Greater New Orleans Caring Collective. He said the building owners allow him to use the space as long as he pays the water, electricity, and trash bills.
On Monday evenings, volunteers from other community organizations show up — some used to set up in the parking lot before Bingler opened the store. They offer free testing for sexually transmitted infections, basic medical care, hot meals, and sterile syringes and other supplies for people who use drugs.
The purpose of the space is simple, Bingler said: “We’re going to make sure we provide for the community.”
Although it’s been open for a few years now, the space has become even more crucial to this community in recent months, with the Trump administration slashing funding for many social service organizations and taking an aggressive approach to homelessness and drug use. In Washington, D.C., the administration has bulldozed tents to push people living on the street to leave the city. Nationally, it has called for people who use drugs to be forced into treatment. It has decried harm reduction — practices that public health experts say keep people who use drugs safe and alive but that critics say promote illegal drug use.

The community space in New Orleans — named the Fred Hampton Free Store after the famous Black Panther activist known for bringing together diverse groups to fight for social reforms — aims to be a haven among this sea of changes.
 
It doesn’t receive federal funding, state or local grants, or money from foundations, Bingler said. It’s simply neighbors helping neighbors, he said, tearing up and adding, “It’s a really beautiful thing to be able to share all this space.”
All items inside are provided by people or organizations in the community. Bingler said one time a local hotel undergoing renovations donated 50 flat-screen TVs.
On nights the store is open, often more than 100 people visit, Bingler said.
One fall evening, dozens of people browsed for free clothing and over-the-counter medications. Others sat on the grass outside, chatting while keeping an eye on their bicycles or grocery carts full of possessions.
James Beshears stopped by the harm reduction group in the parking lot to get sterile supplies he uses to inject heroin and fentanyl. He said he’d been in treatment for years but relapsed after his doctor moved away and he was referred to a clinic that charged $250 a day. Street drugs were cheaper than treatment, he said.
He wants to stop. But until he can find affordable care, places like the free store keep him going. Without it, he said, he’d have “one foot in the grave.”
Another man in the parking lot was waiting for the arrival of Aquil Bey, a paramedic and former Green Beret well known for helping people overcome obstacles to getting health care. As soon as the man spotted Bey’s black Jeep, he ran up.
“I’ve got stage 4 kidney disease,” the man said, adding that he was scheduled for treatments at a hospital but was struggling to get there.
“Do me a favor,” Bey said as he unloaded folding tables and medical equipment from his car. “When our team gets here, come and see us. Maybe we can get you transportation.”
Bey is the founder of Freestanding Communities, a volunteer-run organization that provides free basic medical care and referrals for people who are homeless, using drugs, or part of other vulnerable communities. The group has a steady presence at the free store.
That day, Bey and his team connected the man needing kidney disease treatment to reduced-cost transit programs. They also did blood pressure and blood sugar checks for anyone who wanted them, cleaned infected wounds, and called clinics to make appointments for patients without phones.

A man with a leg injury mentioned he was sleeping on the concrete floor of an abandoned naval base. Bey noticed the free store’s furniture section had a mattress. He and another volunteer hauled it out, strapped it to the top of a car, and delivered it to where the man was sleeping.
 
“We’re just trying to find all these barriers” that people face and “find ways to fix them,” Bey said.
The clinic at the free store helped Stephen Wiltz connect with addiction care. He grew up in the Lower 9th Ward and had been using drugs since he was 10.
Fed up with discrimination from doctors who blamed him for his addiction, Wiltz said, he was reluctant to go to any treatment facility. But after years of knowing the volunteers at the free store, he trusted them to point him in the right direction.
At 56, Wiltz was in sustained recovery for the first time in his life, he said during a phone interview in the fall.
Those volunteers “cared for people who didn’t have nobody to care for them,” he said.
As the sun went down that fall evening at the store, a punk band started setting up for a show across the room from the medical clinic. Lights dimmed and music blared — a reminder that this was not your everyday clinic or community center.
Bey continued consulting with a patient who had gout.
“I get used to the sound,” Bey said of the rapid drums and loud power chords. “I like it sometimes.”

A viral video posted just after Christmas spurred an avalanche of news coverage, changes from the Trump administration, and congressional hearings that appeared to indicate that a massive trove of child care fraud was just uncovered in Minnesota.
Much of it has been misleading.
The video by right-wing YouTuber Nick Shirley posted Dec. 26 purports to show that various Minneapolis day cares run by Somali Americans are not providing services to children despite receiving public funding. Although the video has already been debunked by investigators, the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have seized on it. Vice President JD Vance said Shirley “has done far more useful journalism than any of the winners of the 2024 [Pulitzer Prizes].”
The fallout has been massive. In the past week, the Trump administration has frozen child care payments to five Democratic-run states and ramped up reporting requirements for all states receiving child care funds to cover services for the lowest-income kids. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, has suspended his reelection campaign over it.
But the real story behind child care fraud in Minnesota is far less nefarious.
Here’s what we actually know about child care fraud in Minnesota and elsewhere, and how day cares and families may be impacted by the new changes.
What does Nick Shirley uncover in his video?
Nothing conclusive. The video shows Shirley visiting day cares run by Somali Americans, sometimes under the false pretense of trying to enroll a child. In a couple of instances, workers do open the door but seem immediately suspicious when it’s clear Shirley is recording them and refuse to let him in or give him more information.
Because some of the sites appear closed and Shirley doesn’t see any children, he declares this as proof of fraud at these facilities.
Most child care centers are locked and have obscured doors or windows for children’s safety. Children are also kept in classrooms and would not likely be visible from a reception area. One of the day cares in the video told several news outlets that it did not grant Shirley entrance because he showed up with a handful of masked men, which raised suspicions that the men were agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. At least one of the centers was closed at the time Shirley arrived because it opens later in the day to serve the children of second-shift workers.

Is there a history of child care fraud in the state?
Yes, but it’s not as widespread as Shirley claims.
The federal government sends money to states to subsidize the cost of care for very low-income children, and some states put additional funds into that system. In Minnesota, it’s known as the Child Care Assistance Program, or CCAP. Centers that accept children on subsidies will bill the state for the cost of caring for those kids.
In 2019, a state investigation found that there was probably several million dollars in child care fraud taking place within that system, where centers were billing for children they were not providing services for. Investigators believed the level of child care fraud in the state was more than the $5 million to $6 million prosecutors had been able to prove until that point.
By 2019, state prosecutors had charged at least a dozen Minnesotans and centers with defrauding the state’s child care program in the prior five years.
After the 2019 report was issued, the state tightened oversight, including creating the Department of Children, Youth and Families to take over child care licensing, oversight and auditing. Last year, Minnesota passed a law to criminalize kickbacks for child care program enrollment referrals.
A 2025 report by the federal Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General found that issues with overpayments continue in the state. The inspector general sampled 1,155 child care centers and found that 11 percent of the payments made to those centers in 2023 had errors.
But that doesn’t necessarily mean there was fraud. Improper payments is an umbrella term that could include fraud.
For example, “an improper payment is a child was present for 40 hours and somehow the state paid only for 30 hours. Fraud is when you’re charging for kids that were never enrolled,” explained Danielle Ewen, a national child care expert.
An 11 percent rate puts Minnesota above the permissible 10% threshold established by the federal government, Ewen said. On average nationwide, the rate is 4%.
So while child care fraud is something Minnesota has been working to reduce in recent years, “these are not new issues, but they are being repackaged and they are being promoted in ways to make it seem like there is an epidemic,” said Elliot Haspel, a national child care expert, on a call with reporters this week.

Is there evidence of large-scale child care fraud nationwide?
No.
According to a 2020 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, only seven states since 2013 have had errors in more than 10 percent of their child care fund payments. That also does not mean there is necessarily fraud, but rather errors in overbilling.
The federal Office of Child Care did not respond to questions about The 19th about which states are above the threshold.
What did state investigators find when they investigated the day cares in the videos?
State investigators conducted unannounced visits at the day cares in the viral video over the past six months as part of the typical licensing and auditing process, according to Tikki Brown, the commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Children, Youth and Families. An analysis of publicly available inspection records by The 19th found that most of the centers had unannounced inspections as recently as October, November or December.
After the video was posted, investigators from the state Office of Inspector General conducted compliance visits to nine of the 10 centers in the video (one of the centers in the video has been closed for several years and has not received funds in that time). They found normal operations and children at all but one, which had not yet opened for the day. Further investigations are being conducted into four of the nine facilities, but the state has not said what exactly it’s investigating.
Most of the centers in the video did have numerous state licensing violations against them regarding cleanliness, staff supervision and some recordkeeping around immunizations and allergies. But none of the violations against the centers were regarding fraud, according to state enforcement records.
Quality Learning Center, the center most prominently featured in the video because one of its signs misspelled learning, closed this week. Another center in the video, Mako Childcare Center, has been closed since 2022, the Minnesota Department of Children, Youth and Families said.
There is evidence of one of the day cares in the video having a connection to prior fraud investigations. Fowsiya Hassan, the CEO of Minnesota Best Childcare Center, previously owned another day care called Sunshine Child Care Center that was raided in 2022 as part of an overbilling fraud investigation. No charges were brought.
Hassan sued the state last year over the raid, which led to the closure of Sunshine, claiming “licensing and fraud investigations in Minnesota have long been disproportionately targeted against Somalis.”
How can I check if my child’s day care has been inspected and audited?
Every state is federally mandated to publicly report the results of inspections at licensed child care centers (including the dates of the inspections), and day cares are required to undergo at least one unannounced inspection a year. In Minnesota, that information can be found at the state’s Licensing Information Lookup tool.
To find information on your state, visit The 19th’s child care safety dashboard which has a link to each state’s dashboard of child care providers.
Why was the Somali community targeted?
David Hoch, the lobbyist and former right-wing candidate for Minnesota attorney general who serves as the main source in Shirley’s video, received information on the centers from Republican staffers in Minnesota.
Hoch has had a particular focus on the Somali community and fraud for some time. In a now-deleted Instagram account, Hoch posted almost exclusively about the Somali community, according to reporting in The Intercept.
“EVERY Somali in MN is engaged in fraud. ALL of them,” Hoch posted.  “Even the Blacks have had enough of the demon Muslims,” he said in November.
Over the years, whistleblowers alleged that the fraud money in Minnesota’s child care system was being used to fund the Somali terrorist organization al-Shabab. The 2019 Office of the Legislative Auditor investigation found those claims to be unsubstantiated.
The Somali community has been a particular target of President Donald Trump, who has claimed that “much of the Minnesota Fraud, up to 90%, is caused by people that came into our Country, illegally, from Somalia.”
The president last month called Somali immigrants “garbage” who he doesn’t want in the country.
Minnesota has the largest Somali population in the United States, and child care has historically been an industry that employs large numbers of immigrants. About 1 in 5 child care workers are immigrant women.
Since Shirley’s video, there have been numerous reports of people harassing Somali-run day cares and businesses either through in-person visits demanding to see children, or through threatening phone calls. At least one center was broken into.
Day cares in Minnesota have reported concerns for children and staff safety, particularly as ICE activity in the state has ramped up.
Dawn Uribe, the owner of four Spanish-immersion preschools in Minnesota, said she “really can’t overstate how afraid” her all-immigrant staff is since the video was posted even though all have work authorization and most are citizens or permanent residents.
“We are really preparing for the next couple of weeks for people to be calling off [work] and not coming,” Uribe said.
What is the child care funding freeze and who is impacted by it?
After the video was released, the Trump administration announced a funding freeze to five Democratic-run states: Minnesota, California, Colorado, New York and Illinois. The freeze would stop federal child care funds from flowing to states to cover care for low-income children. It was also pausing $7.3 billion in funding for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which supports low-income families, in those five states.
The five states impacted sued the administration over the freeze arguing that withholding the funds from low-income and vulnerable families would cause “immediate and devastating impacts.” On Friday, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to release the funds while the case is pending.
Officials had previously said funds would be released “only when states prove they are being spent legitimately.”
In Minnesota, state officials had until Friday to provide additional documentation, including Social Security numbers for all of the estimated 23,000 children who receive child care funds in the state, to the federal Department of Health and Human Services.
The state has informed providers that it has “several months” of reserves to cover care for those children should federal funds be frozen, so child care centers and families have not been impacted directly.
It’s unclear what evidence the Trump administration had to justify freezing funds to California, Colorado, New York and Illinois. In a letter to Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, Alex Adams, the assistant secretary for the Administration for Children and Families, said the Trump administration was “concerned by the potential for extensive and systemic fraud in Illinois” and added that it has reason to believe the state is “illicitly providing illegal aliens with CCDF benefits intended for American citizens and lawful permanent residents.”
Nationally, every state will also now have to submit additional documentation to access child care dollars, a process that could slow payments to centers and increase the risk of day cares cutting staff or limiting operations.
Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, declined to comment on any of the questions from The 19th.
“For too long, Democrat-led states and Governors have been complicit in allowing massive amounts of fraud to occur under their watch,” he said in a statement. “Under the Trump Administration, we are ensuring that federal taxpayer dollars are being used for legitimate purposes.”
Are there other impacts from the freeze?
National child care experts said there is a lot of confusion around exactly what data the federal government is requiring states to submit, and whether it’s even data states have on hand to provide.
For providers and families, there is a lot of uncertainty on what happens next and whether a freeze could still occur.
Freezing child care funding can lead day cares to cut staff, close classrooms or close entirely because many don’t have reserves to continue operations. During the government shutdown at the end of 2025, for example, numerous Head Start child care programs that rely on federal funding closed in at least 13 states.
Kylie Cooper, a director of a child care center in the Twin Cities, said that the families who face the most uncertainty are those with the fewest resources if their child care options fall through.
“These are the families who absolutely need [it],” she said. “They likely don’t have PTO or benefits in place with their employers if they have to take a day off work for child care. There’s not a support system.”
About 95 percent of the families who receive assistance in her program are headed by single mothers.
“If that freeze were to go into effect there are a whole lot of centers that run on a very thin margin and most of their kids are CCAP,” Cooper said. “They would last less than a month before they’re closing their doors.”

(Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)The two candidates most likely to be Colorado’s next governor shared a stage for the first time at a union hall Saturday just north of Denver, addressing a crowd of Democrats eager to hear about the party’s path forward under President Donald Trump’s second administration.
U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, both Democrats, took questions from moderators and audience members in a forum hosted by the Colorado Young Democrats at the headquarters of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 68.
Bennet began the event by acknowledging Renee Good, the Colorado-born woman who was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis on Wednesday, sparking protests around the state and nation. Weiser called Good’s killing a “painful reminder” of what can happen “when we fail to train officers for the work they need to do safely.”

In their first face-to-face appearance ahead of the June 30 primary for governor, both Democrats promised to stand up to Trump and make Colorado a more affordable place to live.
“We are living at a momentous time in Colorado history and American history,” Bennet said. “We are living at a time when we have some of the worst income inequality and wealth inequality that we’ve seen as a nation in a hundred years, and your generation is going to bear the cost of that, if we don’t act quickly to deal with it.”
“I’m here as the child and grandchild of Holocaust survivors, liberated by U.S. soldiers, who made a decision to come to America and build a life for themselves, to get union jobs and opportunity,” Weiser said. “And that’s what I want for everyone here.”
Heavily favored
But the two candidates sparred repeatedly over their differences in approach throughout their 30 minutes onstage together. Weiser criticized Bennet’s votes in favor of several Trump Cabinet nominees and a super PAC supporting Bennet’s campaign that has received donations from billionaires and dark money groups.
“Colorado and America want fighters — people who meet the moment,”  said Weiser, who touted the 50 lawsuits his office has filed against the Trump administration since last January. “And I’ve shown as attorney general what that looks like.”
Bennet twice objected to being “lectured” by Weiser about resisting Trump, dismissing the attorney general’s raft of legal actions against the administration — many of which are brought jointly by the attorneys general of numerous Democratic-led states — as “signing on to other people’s lawsuits.”
“My opponent spends a lot of time talking about — fight, fight, fight, lawsuit, lawsuit, lawsuit,” Bennet said. “But what we really need in this nation, in addition to fighting Trump, is a vision for what the future is going to look like.”
Weiser, a former law professor, is serving his second term as attorney general after he was first elected in 2018.
Bennet is a former Denver Public Schools superintendent who was appointed to the Senate by Gov. Bill Ritter in 2009. He ran unsuccessfully for president in 2020 before winning reelection to a third full term in 2022.
The winner of the primary between Weiser and Bennet will be heavily favored to win the general election in November. Coloradans have only elected one Republican governor in the last 50 years. Democrats have won every statewide election held in the last eight years by an average of more than 10 percentage points, and are widely expected to gain ground in a favorable midterm election year.
Democratic Gov. Jared Polis is term-limited.

That’s one of the few areas of bipartisan consensus left in a state that sometimes feels as polarized as the rest of the country. 
But every year — especially the ones when their name is on the ballot — the state’s elected officials and candidates flock to tiny Gillett in southeast Arkansas for its annual Coon Supper. They join hundreds of people in a school gymnasium to eat the mammal. Or at least the politicians pretend to.
“I think that’s kind of the strategy,” conceded Republican U.S. Sen. John Boozman, who began attending the annual event when the state was considered solidly blue. “You brag about eating coon, but you don’t say when you ate it.”
When asked whether he enjoyed eating raccoon meat, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe said: “No, but I ate it. Because you were expected to.”
The supper is one of those quirks of Arkansas politics that’s somehow stood the test of time. In an era where retail politicking is replaced with six-figure ad buys and dueling messages on X, it’s one of the few truly required stops left for the state’s politicians. 
You can skip a debate or two, you can miss a festival, but God help you if you don’t make time for this supper.
That was certainly the case on Saturday night, as hundreds packed the gymnasium for this year’s supper. Rows of tables were filled with attendees _ including a few wearing raccoon skin hats _ who sat down to help themselves to the titular main course, as well as brisket, sweet potatoes and rice. Politicians on hand included Republican U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton and Hallie Shoffner, who’s running for the Democratic nomination to challenge him this year.
Technically, the dinner is a nonpolitical event. Officeholders can speak, but non-officeholders cannot. That’s at least on the official program. 
Once a fundraiser for high school athletics, the event now raises money for college scholarships. Gillett High School is no longer open, but the school’s gymnasium is still used for the dinner.
The political lore surrounding the supper is legendary. Former President Bill Clinton often tells the tale about crash-landing in an airplane with the late Sen. Dale Bumpers on the way to the supper. The two arrived at the supper unharmed, and thus a favorite political story was born.
During 2014’s multimillion-dollar Senate fight between then-incumbent Mark Pryor and challenger Tom Cotton, the Gillett event drew swarms of national media. Pryor brought several Senate colleagues, including Dick Durbin of Illinois and Angus King of Maine. 
Glasses with the event’s familiar black-and-orange logo are a badge of honor for the state’s politicos and reporters. I still have mine from the first one I attended 20 years ago, and a ballcap adorned with images of pawprints and a camouflage bill.
By the way, I ate raccoon at all three  suppers I’ve attended. It’s not something I’d recommend as part of one’s regular diet.
Proof that the author ate some of the raccoon meat served at this year’s event (Andrew DeMillo/Arkansas Advocate)
Beebe recounts how in his first political race, for the state Senate district that included Gillett, the incumbent he was challenging went to a party before the supper at the late Marion Berry’s home and saw nearly everyone in attendance wearing a Beebe campaign button.
The incumbent dropped out about a month after seeing that.
Berry, whose congressional district included Gillett, said he wouldn’t have had a political career if it weren’t for the supper.
Berry, who passed away in 2023, was known for the parties he would hold before the supper with friends and supporters. Attendees would mingle, enjoy their “adult beverages,” and munch on food that’s not normally considered roadkill.
Berry’s family members, friends and former aides now use the pre-party as a fundraiser for a public service scholarship in Berry’s name for Arkansas State University students. The event is now held at the Berry farm shop, a short drive from the supper. Signs from the late Berry’s congressional campaigns adorn the shop and are used to help visitors find the party.
“It’s just such a unique environment,” said Gabe Holmstrom, a former Berry staffer and one of the organizers of the pre-supper party. “It’s this metal farm shop in the middle of a bean field in early January and you just have all these folks showing up.”
The supper and pre-party event in many ways is a scene from a bygone era, though with modern flourishes that include participants taking selfies for social media.
There are still some semi-required stops for politicians around the state such as the Hope Watermelon Festival and the Slovak Oyster Supper, but the Coon Supper has seemed to withstand most of the changes in Arkansas politics.
Boozman said the decline in such gatherings is “emblematic” of a larger problem: fewer people going out to gather in person to meet at places like civic clubs.
“It’s sad these things are in decline now,” Boozman said.

Fourteen months after crashing at the 2024 Killington World Cup, the Burke Mountain Academy graduate turned most-winning Alpine racer in history is again ascending — just in time for her fourth Olympics.

The last time many Vermonters saw Mikaela Shiffrin, the Alpine ski racer was standing atop Killington’s Superstar trail, seemingly a minute away from scoring an unprecedented 100th World Cup win.
Then, figuratively and literally, she went downhill fast.
The Burke Mountain Academy graduate had snagged the lead in the first of two giant-slalom runs on Nov. 30, 2024, only to follow up by slipping, somersaulting and slamming into a fence 12 seconds from the finish line.
Some 20,000 spectators went silent as the two-time Olympic gold medalist was rushed away on a rescue sled. They and 2 million national television viewers wouldn’t learn more until the skier took to Instagram at dusk from the nearby Rutland Regional Medical Center.
“I am so sorry to scare everybody,” Shiffrin said in a selfie video as she revealed an abdominal wound with a playful “ay, ay, ay.”
Fourteen months later, the 30-year-old is again on the rise in advance of next month’s Winter Olympics in Italy. Commentators point to her opening five-race winning streak this World Cup season. People with closer ties add that just returning to competition was a feat in itself.
“She’s been the best in the world for a long time, but given everything that has happened, to stay there is one of her most impressive accomplishments,” says Willy Booker, head of Shiffrin’s alma mater in the Northeast Kingdom.
Shiffrin graduated from the grade 8-12 ski school in 2013, the same year she became the youngest U.S. woman (at 17) to win a slalom world championship. Moving on to the Olympics, she scored slalom gold in 2014 and giant slalom gold and Alpine combined silver in 2018. A year later, she became the first skier to claim World Cup victories in all six disciplines — slalom, giant slalom, parallel slalom, alpine combined, super-G and downhill.
Booker, a onetime competitor himself, was at Killington on the 2024 Thanksgiving weekend when Shiffrin rocketed through the first of two runs of the giant slalom — a race down and around a series of gates — sparking the crowd to buzz about a potential new peak: a never-before-seen 100th World Cup win.

“It was amazing, building towards this crescendo,” Booker recalls of the anticipation.
Come the second round, NBC sportscasters spoke of especially icy course conditions just before Shiffrin launched from the start at 50 mph.
“She’s nervous, she’s a little bit stiff, and why would you not be?” commentator Picabo Street said on air. “But she’s forward, she’s leaning into it.” 
That’s when Shiffrin slipped, struck two gates, lost a ski, slammed into a fence and went scarily still — all in five seconds.

“Nobody knew how bad it was,” Booker remembers of the sudden hush.
Medics transported Shiffrin about 15 miles west to Rutland Regional Medical Center, where hospital spokespeople maintained patient confidentiality even as the athlete and her crew set up cameras in the emergency room.
Shiffrin posted on social media that night, then appeared on NBC from Killington the next day.
“We’re just not totally sure how I got punctured,” she told viewers of the stab wound that missed perforating her colon by millimeters. “Very lucky to not have worse injuries.”
But Shiffrin added that it hurt to breathe, let alone move — similar to how she felt after the accidental death of her 65-year-old father in 2020 and her failure to medal after three falls in the 2022 Olympics.
After Killington, some would sit out the rest of the season, especially with the concluding world championships less than 10 weeks away. But Shiffrin was determined to return, even after fluid buildup and infection-signaling fever and chills forced her into surgery two weeks later.
Developing a step-by-step rehabilitation plan, the skier focused first on simply standing, then walking, then easy exercises and, after four weeks, stepping into ski boots and snow.
Two months after her crash, Shiffrin raced the World Cup slalom in Courchevel, France, on Jan. 30, 2025, finishing a seemingly confidence-building 10th. But she continued to struggle off the course, seeing occasional flashes of imagined stumbles and spills.
A therapist viewed the visions as signs of post-traumatic stress disorder before sharing words from the late children’s television star Mister Rogers: “What’s mentionable is manageable.” And so Shiffrin expanded her recovery efforts from body to mind.
“A lot of it is trust that with time and practice and exposure, clarity will come back,” the athlete recalled in a recent self-produced video series, “Moving Right Along,” on her YouTube channel.
Shiffrin went on to ski at the February world championships in Saalbach, Austria, placing fifth in the slalom and helping the U.S. team win a combined event. She capped the month a week later in Sestriere, Italy, by finally scoring her 100th World Cup victory.
Since then, Shiffrin has increased her World Cup total to 106. Students and staff at Burke Mountain Academy are set to watch her attempt to add to her medal count at next month’s Olympics.
“There is a huge amount of pride,” Booker says. “They go to the same school as the greatest ski racer of all time.”
One who has little else to prove — yet, in her estimation, still more to gain.
“I’ve been doing this for a while, but I’m still learning new things,” Shiffrin concluded in her video series. “There’s new exciting adventures always just around the corner, and I’m looking forward to seeing what’s next.”

Although the idea may be new to Vermont, it’s not entirely unheard of in the country, said Rep. Leanne Harple, D-Glover, a member of the House Committee on Education.

Isa Harrington, a South Burlington High School student, is a firm believer in the democratic process — even though she hasn’t had a chance to exercise her rights to the fullest extent yet, as she is only 17.
Still, the right to vote has been heavy on her mind since the summer months, when she joined the Governor’s Institute at Champlain College, which gave her some firsthand experience into just how powerful youth action can be. So powerful that a bill, spearheaded by Harrington and the student group, set to hit the House floor this legislative session is, for the first time in the state, attempting to give student representatives on school boards a binding vote on issues that come before the elected body.
Although the idea may be new to the state, it’s not entirely unheard of in the country, said Rep. Leanne Harple, D-Glover, a member of the House Committee on Education, who plans to sponsor the proposed legislation this session.
“In Maryland, eight of the state’s 24 local school districts have student board members with the right to cast votes,” she said. “This is not completely new territory that the students just made up.”
Harrington is heavily involved in school happenings, especially as a member of the student council. She says that although opportunities are available for students to become involved, it can, at times, seem more like an illusion of power.
“Student voice just doesn’t have as much power as it should when it comes to making decisions regarding education,” Harrington said. “It’s really hard to make policy that is for the students if you don’t have student input on what is necessary. And so often, what happens is there are policies that are being enacted that are focusing on the wrong priorities.”
The South Burlington School Board has historically had two student representatives, a junior and a senior from the high school, to represent the student body on the board. While those seats had never been able to cast a vote — even a non-binding one — this year, senior Ally Leduc and junior Momin Waqar, broached the topic with the board, who ultimately agreed to allow the students to cast a non-binding vote on issues.
But Waqar and Leduc explained that even having this added responsibility of taking an unofficial vote has added a new level of seriousness to their roles. Being a student representative is a hefty time commitment, and Waqar noted that having a binding vote in the future could add even more time commitments.
“If we’re also given a binding vote, then it’s our responsibility to be on top of that work, to stay informed on everything we’re voting on,” Waqar said. “Even when we got our non-binding vote, it was a really important conversation we had about being able to abstain from the vote if you’re not fully aware of what’s going on.”
Overall, both students agree that having a binding vote could be a step in the right direction to bring student perspective into the conversation, but details still need to be fleshed out before the duo takes a firm stance on the issue. They are, however, putting a lot of thought into both sides of the debate — as any responsible representative would.
Harrington touted Waqar and Leduc as excellent representations of the student body, but said their dedication is only one small glimpse into how passionate students are becoming about cultural, social and political issues — especially ones that affect their education.
“What you’re seeing more recently is that students are turning out,” she said. “You’re seeing an increase in young people who are participating in protests, getting engaged with their school boards, with their communities. They’re taking these steps to be involved. And that’s super important in general, to having a community, a country, a state, where everyone feels that their voice is being represented. It’s kind of foundational.”
The student body is, after all, the future, Harrington said. And that’s a responsibility she doesn’t take lightly. But she isn’t naive about the fact that others may not have the same ideas as she does, and for her, that’s OK, because that’s also part of the democratic process. She just hopes this opens more doors for students to have a seat at that table.
She noted that the conversation is especially timely given the current landscape of Vermont’s public education system. New legislation passed last year has promised that how schools are funded and governed is going to change in the coming years.
“I think helping create this platform for myself to prove that it was possible has made a whole world of difference in increasing the conviction I already had that it is so important for students to be able to make these changes,” Harrington said.
The bill, still in early draft form, dictates that school district boards include voting student members in grades nine, 10, 11 and 12 and non-voting members in grades seven and eight. The appointment would be overseen by the superintendent of the district through a process outlined by the given school board.
Harple, who is also a teacher at Hazen Union High School, noted that while she has heard from some legislators about an interest in co-sponsoring the bill, she is aware that there is likely to be some pushback.
But the ethos of the effort itself is worth it.
“This was legislation that students came up with, where they identified a problem, that they didn’t think they had a strong enough voice and huge decisions that are being made right now are affecting the future of their education,” Harple said. “And when asked to find a solution, they came up with the solution. And I was like, ‘That’s actually not a bad idea. I’m going to see it through.’ And that itself is a reason to see this through, that students are doing this work. We should help them see if they can get this into law.”

It’s one example of shifts in Congress he’s dealt with.","In a year filled with power struggles between Congress and the White House, Jim Himes is one of the small group of lawmakers who have felt the brunt of it.
That came into stark relief last weekend after the U.S. strike on Venezuela and the capture of its president. As a high-ranking official on the House Intelligence Committee, Himes is one of the “Gang of Eight” who traditionally get some of the earliest information about major military operations.
Yet he was left in the dark for days.
So Himes, who represents Connecticut’s 4th District in the southwestern portion of the state, has had to learn to navigate not only the challenges of serving in the Democratic minority but also in a Congress that the executive branch increasingly bypasses on some military and federal spending issues, despite Congress’ constitutional authority.
But despite the Venezuela snub, the Democratic minorities in Congress and the broader challenges to democracy here and abroad, Himes says he’s still in the game and still able to wield power as a top Democrat on a key committee. 
That’s partly because the sands are slowly shifting in Washington.
Back in January 2025, “that was a pretty defeated moment, and almost all the Republicans were 100% Donald Trump,” Himes said in an interview from his Washington, D.C., office last week. “That’s changed, partly because of the result of the November elections.”
“So politics is back because Republicans know that if they are unquestioning in their support of Donald Trump, they’re going to get shellacked” in the midterm elections this fall, he said. 
‘Dangerous and unprecedented’
Himes went into the past year with some expectations of how President Donald Trump might operate in his second term, given his experiences the last time. But that has looked different, he said, with the vast expansion of executive powers. He argued the current administration has taken it to a “dangerous and unprecedented place.”
“A lot of this stuff is just picking up a baseball bat and hitting yourself in the head,” he said, running through a list of threats Trump has made regarding other countries in the wake of Venezuela. “We get nothing for that, and it hurts us.”
When Himes was preparing for Trump to take office almost a year ago, he devised a system of when to engage and decipher what was serious and what was just rhetorical bluster. At the time, he wrote off Trump’s comments about Greenland, calling it “obvious nonsense.”
Given Trump’s repeated overtures about the autonomous island that’s part of Denmark, the congressman said, he’s coming around to the plausibility of it becoming a reality, even as some downplay or rebuff the possibility of taking Greenland by military force.
Himes sees his job through different lenses, with varying degrees of interference. On the issues that are more Connecticut-specific — transportation and infrastructure chief among them — he said they’re “grinding away pretty well,” even with issues like the stop-work order at Revolution Wind. But from the vantage point of national security — the bulk of his job in D.C. — it’s “much more of a mixed bag.”
If you as a citizen decide that this is a Yankees-Red Sox game and the other side is evil and treasonous and seditious and you are the sole arbiter of truth, we’ll have an authoritarian government.U.S. Rep. Jim Himes
Serving in the minority party typically comes with its limitations, especially with Republicans’ political trifecta of the White House and both chambers of Congress. Yet the GOP’s narrow majorities means they need to take Democrats into account, given their votes are needed on most legislation, particularly in the Senate.
While some elements of his job involving intelligence matters have been hindered, other things haven’t changed as he had anticipated at the start of 2025. And he still feels like he’s able to assert himself.
“I don’t feel like I have no effect. And I worried about that a year ago. Republicans can’t ignore Democrats entirely,” Himes said, whether it’s on an annual defense policy bill or appropriations. “So I don’t feel irrelevant on a lot of things.”
The role of the Intelligence Committee
Because of his prominent role in Congress, Himes has repeatedly found himself at the forefront of major foreign policy matters with wide-ranging implications.
As a member of the “Gang of Eight,” a group of the Republican and Democratic leaders in the House and Senate plus the chairs and ranking members of both intelligence committees, Himes typically gets a heads-up on major military actions.
The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has oversight over U.S. intelligence agencies as well as some issues concerning the Pentagon and other government agencies. He’s served on that committee since 2013 and was elevated to ranking member in 2023.

But for Democratic leaders who are usually privy to such information, Himes said, he hadn’t received any communication from White House officials in the days since the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife until the Monday evening briefing with the Gang of Eight.
Lawmakers pushed back on the administration for not notifying Congress before the attack. But Trump officials defended the decision, saying it could have compromised the operation and put U.S. troops at risk. That has become more common of presidential administrations, led by both Democrats and Republicans. One recent example is former President Barack Obama not seeking congressional authorization or providing Congress a heads-up before bombing Libya in 2011.
“Presidents of both parties have long relied on their constitutional authority to act when foreign actors pose a direct threat to the safety and security of the United States and its people. President Trump did exactly that,” the Connecticut Republican Party said in a statement after the capture of Maduro, specifically naming Himes and a few other Connecticut Democrats for “playing politics.”
This wasn’t the first time Himes learned of significant military action through other channels.
When the U.S. launched strikes on nuclear facilities in Iran last June, Himes learned of the news through social media.
It was nearly déjà vu last weekend. Himes told NPR’s “Morning Edition” his wife woke him up on last Saturday, saying, “You won’t believe what’s happening.”
While he has said it was successful as a military and tactical mission, Himes called it “illegal” and “unwise.” And after sitting in on briefings, it was clear to him that officials had no plans for what to do after. 
But from a morality standpoint, it’s a bit more nuanced, because Maduro is a “bad, bad guy.”
As the administration maps out its next moves in the region, officials like Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of War Pete Hegseth have defended their approach.
“Our military is prepared to continue this,” Hegseth told reporters after Wednesday’s Venezuela briefings with all members of Congress. “The president, when he speaks, he means it. He’s not messing around. We are an administration of action to advance our interests, and that is on full display.”
In his own words, Trump made it clear how he views the limitations of his own powers, particularly abroad.

“Yeah, there is one thing. My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me,” Trump said in an interview with The New York Times on Wednesday.
Even so, Himes said, he’s had small victories, particularly in the intelligence community — including some he can’t discuss, given the classified nature of the job. He said he helped add a measure into the National Defense Authorization Act that supported the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Trump’s administration has been skeptical of NATO, and the alliance faces a potential crisis if the U.S. seizes Greenland. 
Himes’ role in it all
When it comes to Congress’ war powers, Himes acknowledged that administrations led by both parties have been chipping away at that for years.
In defending Trump, Republicans argued that Democrats didn’t take issue when their own party had taken unilateral action, like when the Obama administration intervened in Libya in 2011. At the time, Himes voted to limit further military action in the region.
“The other thing as a member of Congress that is really irritating is that we’re a participant in the now 100-year-long argument over who gets to approve the commitment of our troops,” Himes said. “Now the Constitution to me is pretty clear, but to be fair, we’ve had this argument with presidents of both parties.” 
But he argued the Trump administration has taken that to a new level.
That has left him to reflect on his role as a member of Congress and as a top member of the intelligence committee — even in more hyperbolic terms.

“In looking at the administration’s planned intelligence activities, I’ve had deep moral qualms, and I have expressed those, and I think I’ve had some effect on altering programs in ways that are not to my satisfaction but at least move, in my opinion, those programs in the right direction,” Himes said.
When speaking at the Connecticut Mirror’s “In the Room” event back in April, he mused about whether he’d need to break the law by speaking publicly about classified information, if it meant holding the administration accountable, in extreme circumstances. The hypothetical scenario he gave at the time was if Trump mobilized the CIA to target an American within the country.
He stands by the comments he made but said there’s a blurred line because “you got to think about policy disagreements differently than you think about clear moral stands.”
“If you had something that was legal and profoundly immoral, I’d be like ‘OK, what do I do?’ Himes said. “And in some ways, that’s the failsafe, right? If the administration, which I think has been authoritarian and beyond the pale, if it spun in a far darker direction, I would not be looking to compromise with that.”
Over the past year, Himes has mused about a democracy sliding closer to authoritarian system. Himes said it’s incumbent on everyone, including Democrats, to figure out why some Americans are turning away from it.
“It’s in dramatic retreat in the United States, and it’s in retreat all over the world,” Himes said. “That’s a belief that democracy is not providing for them. And we have some self-soul-searching to do in that regard.”
“If you as a citizen decide that this is a Yankees-Red Sox game and the other side is evil and treasonous and seditious and you are the sole arbiter of truth,” he said, “we’ll have an authoritarian government.” 
Small shifts in Congress
Trump is at the end of the first year of his second term, but Himes sees the tide slowly turning with elections on the horizon. That has given the self-described optimist some glimmers of hope — among them, those sporadic moments when Republicans have been more willing to buck the president.
To Himes, it’s a byproduct of the election cycle.
Last week, Congress pushed back repeatedly at the White House as it sought to reassert itself on policy fronts and matters of national security.
For example, the GOP-controlled Senate gave a rare rebuke of Trump as it voted for a war powers resolution to rein in Trump on Venezuela. Under that bill, Trump would need approval from Congress before further engaging in military action in the region.
And nearly a dozen House Republicans joined Democrats to pass the revival of lapsed pandemic-era enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans, as Trump has given mixed messaging on how to proceed with health care. 
On the same day, the House sought to override Trump’s vetoes on bills with overwhelming support, although those efforts fell short, with enough Republicans blocking the effort.
But Himes isn’t shy about criticizing his own party, which he says still needs to learn “how to center the core concerns” of Americans, such as the cost of living. Or that Trump shoulders the blame for everything.
Himes said the bipartisan infrastructure law passed under former President Joe Biden did “jack shit” for his southwestern Connecticut district.
“Shame on us,” Himes said. “That’s not Donald Trump’s fault.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25343796500718-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-11 05:11:42.392488
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-11 09:55:00+00:00,CT Mirror,PAID POST: 2025 Marked Real Mental Health Progress in Connecticut. But Access Gaps Are Still Widening.,Christian Damiana,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/11/paid-post-2025-marked-real-mental-health-progress-in-connecticut-but-access-gaps-are-still-widening/,"After a landmark year for Connecticut mental health reform, families still report widespread insurance and access barriers. New data highlights the urgent need for parity enforcement and stronger networks.","When Gov. Ned Lamont signed Connecticut’s bipartisan behavioral health parity bill on July 10, he framed it as part of a broader shift toward treating mental and physical health equally. He also acknowledged that families still face steep barriers when trying to use their insurance for behavioral health care, including high out-of-pocket costs or too few in-network providers. “Physical health and mental health are one and the same,” Lamont said at the signing. “And we’re going to make sure our insurance companies remember that every day.”
The announcement capped what many advocates say was the most active year for mental health legislation in more than five years. In addition to the parity bill, Lamont appointed the state’s first Behavioral Health Advocate and, during a special session in November, legislators approved a wide-ranging children’s behavioral health bill.
But new data shows that even as the state strengthens oversight, demand for care is rising sharply. According to the CT Parity Coalition’s recent State of Mental Health in Connecticut report, 689,000 adults — five times the population of Stamford — experienced a mental illness in 2024, and the state’s youth mental health ranking fell from second in the nation to 21st in a single year. School administrators, clinicians, and community providers have all reported increased need, particularly among adolescents.
Affordability and insurance barriers remain a major obstacle
The State of Mental Health in Connecticut report also noted that more than 77,000 Connecticut adults could not see a doctor due to cost, despite needing mental health treatment. Residents were four times more likely to be forced out-of-network for mental health care than for primary care, a pattern that advocates say reflects limited in-network provider availability and other longstanding parity issues.
Providers report similar challenges playing out in real time. In testimony earlier this year, one clinician described contacting “at least 27 in-network providers, only to find that none was accepting new patients.” With no available options, she said, a child remained in a higher level of care longer than clinically necessary at great cost to the family.

What parity is — and why enforcement matters now
These access barriers point to a system that is improving –– slowly. And not nearly fast enough to match growing treatment needs. State officials say the new parity law is designed to help close that gap.
Parity is a simple idea with far-reaching implications: mental health and substance use care must be treated the same as physical health care. That means equal coverage, equal access to in-network providers, and equal protection from delays or denials. Fundamentally, arity is the opposite of disparity. Connecticut’s reforms aim to turn parity from a legal requirement into a lived reality for families.
For years, regulators said they lacked the tools to enforce that principle. Until October 1, the maximum an insurer could be fined for a violation was $15,000, an amount advocates noted was negligible for large national carriers tracking tens of billions of dollars in annual profits. Under the 2025 reforms, the state Insurance Commissioner can now fine insurers up to $625,000 annually.
Lamont has emphasized that enforcement must be a priority, signaling that the state intends to use these new authorities.
“We’re going to enforce this. We’re going to make sure there is mental health parity… [the Commissioner of Insurance is] going to enforce this and hold people accountable and make sure our fines are allocated,” he said during the signing.
Connecticut’s next major inflection point will come when the Insurance Department completes its annual parity review, expected this spring. It may mark the first significant action in several years, at a time when other states are already responding aggressively. In September, Delaware fined UnitedHealthcare $450,000 for parity violations. In August, Georgia issued $20 million in fines against health insurers for widespread noncompliance.

Looking ahead
The Connecticut Parity Coalition, a statewide alliance of more than 25 clinician and advocacy organizations, has been tracking these challenges for years. Members say that while 2025 marked a turning point, the next phase of work must focus on ensuring patients can actually access the care they’re entitled to.
“Coverage is only meaningful if people can use it,” said one coalition member. “We finally have the tools. Now we need to make sure they work.”
State officials and advocates agree that Connecticut’s progress in 2025 lays a strong foundation for the years ahead. But many say the next test will be whether the administration follows through on the Governor’s commitment to robust enforcement, and whether insurers adjust their practices in response. With rising need, workforce strain, and administrative barriers, the work is far from over.
As Gov. Lamont said at the signing: “It’s great passing bills, but the bill’s got to be real. The bill’s got to make a difference.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Picture1.jpg,,,2026-01-11 04:57:50.574527

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)What happened after a judge expressed displeasure with the presence of ICE agents in her municipal courtroom last month was yet another sign that our democracy is fraying.
But it wasn’t the judge at fault. It was the heavy-handed response from the state’s top federal prosecutor, who accused the judge of improper conduct and warned city employees not to interfere with or even “disparage” federal immigration officers.
You may have missed this story from Manhattan, Kansas, because it broke on New Year’s Eve, when many of us were celebrating the death of 2025. Barely three days later, we sobered up to the news that our military had struck Venezuela to snatch an alleged drug criminal and his wife and import them to the United States.
But the judicial dustup that began at the Municipal Court building on Colorado Street in the Little Apple may say more about American democracy at ground level than the Maduro affair.
On Dec. 4, Magistrate Judge Sarah Smith Barr paused her opening remarks in a hearing against a woman accused of DUI and leaving the scene of an accident to look at the ICE agents and tell them they “should not be there.” That’s according to reporting by the Manhattan Mercury, which quoted a letter to the city from Ryan Kriegshauser, the U.S. attorney for Kansas.
From the reporting, it was unclear how Barr knew the pair were with ICE.
The plainclothes agents followed the woman out of the courtroom and arrested her in a hallway after the hearing, the letter said. Barr identified the pair as ICE agents to the 20 to 25 people remaining in the courtroom.
Kriegshauser’s letter accused Barr of improperly injecting political overtones into the proceeding and said her remarks were “inappropriate and potentially dangerous,” according to the newspaper. Suggesting ICE agents had no business attending municipal court hearings was improper, the letter said. It was within the discretion of agents to attend public court hearings in seeking lawful arrests and removal of “illegal aliens.”
The letter did not name the woman whom the ICE agents arrested.
The Mercury noted there was no record of what was said in the courtroom at the time of the hearing and that Barr declined comment. The paper also examined the court docket for Dec. 4. It listed 53 individuals, but none was a woman charged with drunk driving and leaving the scene of an accident. Neither the court nor Kriegshauser’s office would identity the woman, the newspaper said.
Barr did not respond to a message from me asking about the hearing. But assuming Kriegshauser’s letter is accurate, Barr’s action falls short of what judges in other states have been disciplined for. A Wisconsin judge who had helped a Mexican migrant dodge ICE agents by allowing her to slip out through a side door was found guilty of obstruction last month. A Massachusetts judge who was accused of helping a migrant evade ICE in 2018 was the subject of a federal indictment and a state ethics complaint.
Federal prosecution of state or local judges is rare, and when it does happen it’s typically been associated with bribery. A bribery scandal rocked the Oklahoma Supreme Court in 1965, for example, set off by a confession from the former chief justice, imprisoned for tax evasion, that he and others had taken bribes amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars for the past 25 years. In the era of Trump, attention has been redirected to “activist judges,” especially in states where sanctuary laws are in tension with federal immigration policies.
But Kansas is not a sanctuary state. In 2022, a law aimed by the Legislature at the Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City’s “Safe and Welcoming City Act” went into effect, banning sanctuary cities statewide.
During the first Trump administration, immigration agents started making arrests at courthouses, which had been long recognized, along with churches and other sacred areas, as “protected spaces.” Courthouse arrests were again prohibited under the Biden administration, but after Trump took office for his second term, in January 2025, Department of Homeland Security policy on courthouses was steadily rolled back, although a federal injunction kept some restrictions on places of worship. Local ICE field offices may now use their discretion to conduct immigration enforcement in and around courthouses.
Thus, many ICE arrests are made at immigration courts across the country, including in Kansas City, Missouri, where individuals are detained and then deported after showing up for what they believe is a routine immigration hearing. Although migrants are guaranteed due process by the U.S. Constitution, the Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to conduct lightning deportations largely unfettered by concerns about rights or racial profiling. With a budget of $28 billion, ICE is now the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the U.S. government.
The weight of this massive immigration enforcement machine was felt in Judge Barr’s municipal courtroom in December when the pair of ICE agents appeared. The agency is fond of courthouse captures because the location of their targets is known with a high degree of confidence and, because of security at courthouses, few are likely to carry weapons.
The problem is that courtrooms are meant to be safe and impartial places. The presence of ICE agents at a hearing they are not a part of introduces the very element of “political overtones” for which Kriegshauser criticized Barr. It would spark a range of emotions, from approval to fear, likely to disrupt the decorum of the court, if not derail the intended purpose of the proceeding. For that reason alone, Barr was correct in objecting.
The judge apparently did not obstruct agents by attempting to hustle the defendant out a side door or otherwise interfere with the arrest. To note one’s professional and ethical displeasure, as Barr did, is not “disparagement.” The message Kriegshauser sent with his letter was a warning to shut up or else.
The question of justice in a free society is, by necessity, eternally unanswered. To ask the nature of justice is to admit that there is still injustice to be addressed. Attempting to define justice is the realm of philosophers who have devoted careers to exploring the weave of democracy, justice and free societies.
“If a just society requires a strong sense of community,” Michael J. Sandel writes in his 2009 book about justice, “it must find a way to cultivate into citizens a concern for the whole, a dedication to the common good.”
What has eroded in the 17 years since Sandel’s “Justice: What’s the Right Thing to Do?” is this concern for the common good. I suspect it has to do with our increasing inability to grasp the important but abstract ideas that have driven American cultural life and domestic policy since the end of World War II. Thinking about justice is hard work.
Just try to imagine justice.
No, seriously. Take a moment, close your eyes, and attempt to imagine what justice looks like. If you’re of a creative bent you might explore whether justice has a sound or a texture. Taste or smell? Sure, why not. But no cheating. You’re not allowed to recall a symbol for justice, such as the famous blindfolded lady with a scale in one hand and a sword in the other.
Can you do it?
Thinking about abstract nouns can give you the equivalent of an ice cream headache. Yet justice is so essential to democracy that it’s something we all should be thinking about right now. The life work of political philosopher John Rawls was linking justice to fairness in a free society, and while we might not have a clear idea about justice, we all know in our gut when something is fair. As a country, we are now engaged in a great struggle over fairness at nearly every level of the public arena.
When I try to imagine justice — and fairness — I get a feeling.
It’s the feeling I get every time I enter a courthouse as a journalist to witness a proceeding. It could be a criminal case where somebody’s on trial for their life, a civil matter where a marriage or a fortune will be decided, or a minor action involving a speeding ticket.
It’s not that I’m naïve enough to believe that courts are perfectly just or that institutions are infallible. No, that feeling of civic reverence that stirs within me is a recognition of the constitutional principles upon which our judicial system is founded, the attempt by imperfect people — judges and lawyers and juries — to aspire to a perfect ideal. I have watched plenty of trials in which justice was more or less served, a few in which it was denied, and just one or two in which I thought the result could not have been more fair. That’s about as close to true justice as we can get in the real world.
Perhaps the most difficult part of believing in a fair and just America is reconciling the aspiration with the reality. People are fallible. Reason and mercy sometimes fail us. Bad laws are passed and oppressive policies enacted. But there is always hope for a correction, as long as there are people willing to speak up and take action.
It took guts for Barr to say what she did.
Courtrooms should not serve as part of the mass deportation machine.
But there’s another reason to keep ICE out of our courtrooms, and that’s the chilling effect that agents might have on the willingness of individuals to report crimes or agree to be witnesses. If you’re an undocumented migrant and you’re being beaten by your partner, wouldn’t you think twice about calling the police if you know deportation awaits at the courthouse door?
Barr, who graduated from the Washburn University School of Law at Topeka and whose grandfather was attorney general of Kansas and on the Kansas Supreme Court, could make a better argument for the sanctity of courtrooms. I suspect she will when the time is right.
Kriegshauser, a Trump nominee who has been U.S. attorney for Kansas since July and confirmed by the Senate on Dec. 19, sent his warning letter to Manhattan’s city manager and commissioners. He said his office is investigating to determine whether Manhattan is a “sanctuary jurisdiction.”
“Make no mistake, my office will take all necessary steps to enforce federal law as needed,” his letter said.
But equal access to the courts is a fundamental principle. Allowing ICE agents to troll courthouses — even municipal courthouses which hear the most minor of offenses — creates a situation in which access is denied entire classes of people. Yes, courtrooms must remain open to the public. But the agents, unlike journalists and other audience members, were not there as observers. They were there as government actors.
The courtroom is the civil cathedral of American government. It should be a place of reverence and a sanctuary from injustice. Of all of our institutions, it must avoid the taint of political influence to keep the trust of the people, for the power of the courts in a free society comes from the trust of the governed. Our trust has been tested time and again in the past year by high court decisions that appear contrary to the ideal of the common good. We must steel ourselves to frustration and keep the flame of a just America burning in our hearts.
The sanctity of American courtrooms must be preserved as a matter not only of justice, but of fairness. The notion that judges should not “disparage” federal immigration agents for shattering the sanctity of our most sacred civic space is dangerous to a functioning democracy.

As we devoured the perfectly ripe melon and delicious strawberries, it got me thinking about how lucky we in Connecticut are to be able to enjoy fresh, out-of-season fruit in the depths of winter.  But how it makes its way to our supermarkets is not only a tale of botany but of logistics and long-distance transportation at some cost to our environment: nature assisted by fossil fuels.
Take for example:
Strawberries: Mostly from Mexico, these are trucked but are prone to spoilage, hence the price.  Trade disputes and seasonal customs duties have periodically increased costs, also affecting avocados and berries.  Climate impact:  relatively high.
Oranges: Mostly from California and Florida, this fruit is picked, washed, sanitized, sorted and packed within 24 hours of ripening on the vine.  Stored at 38 – 45 degrees Fahrenheit in refrigerated trucks it begins a four- to six-day drive cross-country.  At food distribution hubs the truckloads are broken into smaller lots for local delivery.  Climate impact:  moderate.
Grapes: Your favorite snacking fruit has come a long way… 5,000+ miles from Chile.  After harvest the grapes are chilled to 32 degrees and packed in “reefers,” refrigerated shipping containers, for the 12 – 14 day ocean voyage to ports like Wilmington DE and Philadelphia for trucking to Connecticut.  Climate impact:  lower due to shipment by sea.
Blueberries: These are grown in Chile and Peru, hand-picked, washed, graded and packaged for refrigerated shipment to the U.S. by boat.  Climate impact:  lower per‑pound impact because sea freight is fuel‑efficient.
Bananas: This is the perfect fruit for long-distance delivery.  In Ecuador, Costa Rica and Colombia bananas grow on massive bunches weighing about 100 pounds.  Harvested while green and fully mature (but not ripe), they are washed, cut and packed into 40-pound boxes which must be stored at exactly 56 – 58 degrees and shipped in reefers with sophisticated monitoring of oxygen and CO2 levels.  After their 8 – 14 day ocean journey to the U.S. East Coast they are trucked to huge ripening facilities where ethylene gas is slowly added.  In about a week they’re ready for local stores.  Climate impact:  relatively low.
Pineapples: Almost all come from Costa Rica and Ecuador, not Hawaii. Picked almost fully-ripe, they are packed and shipped in reefers at a steady 45 – 50 degrees.  From harvesting to our local stores it’s a 10- to 16-day journey.  Climate impact:  moderate.
Melons: Cantaloupe and honeydew are largely imported from Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico in winter, with the Dominican Republic and other Caribbean sources supplying some specialty melons.  Climate impact:  moderate due to long distance reefer trucking.
Local greenhouses:  Not everything we enjoy in the winter is imported. Some Connecticut greenhouse keep turning out leafy greens, some tomatoes, cucumbers and herbs year round.  Climate impact: Minimal transport needs are offset by substantial winter heating requirements, which can give greenhouse crops a higher overall climate impact than their short travel distance might suggest.
So the next time you’re standing in the produce aisle, marveling at strawberries that taste like July, remember you’re not just buying fruit:  you’re looking at the literal ‘fruits’ of a globe-spanning transportation system running on diesel, refrigeration, container ships, human beings and carefully timed logistics.  
It’s a small reminder that our everyday conveniences quietly depend on a vast transportation network, one we rarely think about until those strawberries show up in the dead of winter.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/blueberries-1024x537.jpg,,,2026-01-11 04:57:50.574527

The Jackson Fire Department, the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives  arrested a suspect Saturday night in the latest blaze after the fire department ruled it arson, according to lead investigator Charles Felton. Investigators did not immediately release the name of the suspect or the charges the person could face.
The fire was reported shortly after 3 a.m. at Beth Israel Congregation on Old Canton Road. No congregants were injured.
The library and administrative offices of Jackson’s only synagogue were reduced to charred ruins. Two Torahs were destroyed and five were damaged in the flames that erupted during Shabbat, the weekly Jewish day of rest, according to temple leaders. One Torah that survived the Holocaust was in a glass case and was undamaged in the fire.
Beth Israel has suspended services indefinitely. 
“We have already had outreach from other houses of worship in the Jackson area and greatly appreciate their support in this very difficult time,” the congregation president, Zach Shemper, said in a statement.

Arson is a criminal act of intentionally setting fire to a structure, Felton, the JFD division fire chief, told Mississippi Today. 
Investigators did not immediately know a possible motive, such as whether it was a hate crime. Jewish congregations have been attacked in the U.S. in the past several years, including in Pittsburgh, the San Diego area and Colleyville, Texas.
The state Homeland Security Office is also assisting in the investigation, said Mississippi Department of Public Safety spokesperson Bailey Martin Holloway.
Mayor John Horhn said he had spoken with Shemper and hoped for a “swift resolution as to the origin of these actions.”  
“I would hope that all Mississippians and all Jacksonians would commit themselves toward moving beyond such behavior and activity and find a way where we can all get together and get along,” Horhn said.

Felton said firefighters had responded shortly after 3 a.m. in response to a report about a possible “church fire.” After they could not determine the origin of the flames, he said his arson investigators were called to the scene and began to collect video surveillance. He said he received calls Saturday morning from the FBI and the ATF, as a matter of course when a fire occurs at a religious institution. 
On Saturday evening, reporters could smell soot outside the temple and observed a melted camera on the northeast wing of the building and six windows covered in plywood. 
An FBI agent standing next to yellow caution tape began collecting pictures and videos from people in the parking lot. Congregants and synagogue leadership had been at the temple all day, assessing the damage.

Some had gone inside the building, stepping over ash-filled puddles of water to retrieve sacred religious objects from the temple, including Torahs. One of the holiest objects in the Jewish religion, the scrolls typically weigh dozens of pounds and stand a couple feet tall.
The fire also burned the synagogue’s Tree of Life, a plaque that honors and records special occasions for congregants such as bar and bat mitzvahs. 
One congregant, David Edelstein, typically attends Saturday morning services. He did not know the synagogue had been burned when he arrived, but he immediately tried to figure out what had happened.

Initially, congregants believed lightning from thunderstorms the night before had started the fire, so Edelstein said he flew a drone over the top of the synagogue and determined that had not happened. 
The hours moved by fast, he said. As Edelstein, wearing a protective breathing mask, helped measure one of the broken library windows, he looked inside and spotted a book lying face up. He stepped into the library to look closer. 
It was open to the Shema, one of the most important prayers in the Jewish faith that reads “Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.” 
“Everything’s charred and stuff but one of the books was on top, opened up right to that,” he said.
Similar to Saturday’s blaze, the 1967 bombing and fire heavily damaged the synagogue’s administrative offices and library but injured no congregants. The rabbi at the time, Perry Nussbaum, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that “bigots” were responsible for the fire, and he believed they might have been inspired by anti-Semitic campaign materials used extensively in that year’s Democratic primary for governor.
Mayor Horhn, 70, said he has some recollection of the 1967 attack, when he was 12.
“I do remember that the Jewish community and the African American community in those days formed alliances and partnerships to fight racism, to fight injustice, to fight mistreatment of citizens for whatever reason,” Horhn said.

Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery, kicked off his lieutenant governor campaign Saturday, promising to use the constitutionally weak office to bring people together.
“I am running to try to bring Alabamians with different backgrounds and political identities together, knowing that we will never agree on everything, but we can find common ground on the things that we all want,” Ensler said.
Speaking to more than 100 people at the RSA Activity Center in downtown Montgomery, Ensler pointed out Alabama’s low national rank in education and access to affordable health care. He promised to work to fix those issues instead of creating more, like what he said other politicians do.

“They demonize and marginalize those who are different. They create problems rather than solve them. They skew ignorance and lie in vitriol just to score political points,” Ensler said. “They enjoy having the title, but do not do a damn thing to actually serve the people.”
In his 10-minute speech, Ensler also promised to work to expand Medicaid, eliminate the sales tax on groceries and create a state lottery. The Legislature cut the state grocery tax to 2% in the 2025 legislative session.
“Most people in Alabama want the same things: more money in their pockets to afford the expenses of life,” he said. “They want safe neighborhoods and reduce gun violence. They want quality public schools that prepare our children for the future, and they want access to affordable health care.”
The governor can expand Medicaid by order, but the Legislature would have to approve funding for it. Ensler said that expanding Medicaid and a lottery would bring in revenue for the state to address its education and health care concerns.
“People are having to drive hours now to get to an emergency room. They’re having to drive hard instances to deliver a baby. So really focusing on Alabama implementing Medicaid expansion once and for all,” Ensler said in an interview before the event. “The lottery, that’s something the Senate came one vote short. Using the ability to bring people together, I have a record of doing that at the Legislature.”
The lieutenant governor presides over the Senate and votes if the chamber should deadlock on a proposal. The occupant of the office also becomes governor should the governor leave office before the end of his or her term, but otherwise has very little power. 
Before Ensler got into Alabama politics, he taught history at Robert E. Lee High School in Montgomery. Two of his former students, Udonna Simpson and Josiah King Rodgers, spoke of Ensler’s character.
“I am from Highland Park, which is a lower-income neighborhood here in Montgomery, Alabama, that is often affected by gun violence. However, Rep. Ensler, he was right there. In the Alabama heat, in the Alabama cold, morning, noon, day, night,” Simpson said. “He was right there, advocating, speaking for residents.”
In July, Ensler announced that he would not seek re-election for House District 74 to move back to his home state, New York, to be closer to family.
Rep. Patrice McClammy, D-Montgomery, attended the event in support of Ensler, but she said that even if there was another Democrat running for the position she would still support Ensler.
“I’ve worked with him in the State House, and all the things he’s done, in the Mayor’s office and the community,” McClammy said in an interview after the event. “I told him, ‘You’re not leaving.’”
Since the beginning of his campaign in mid-December, Ensler has raised over $54,000, according to campaign finance records. All of the campaign donations came from individuals, according to the reports. 
Ensler is the first Democrat to join the lieutenant governor race, joining five Republicans, who include current Secretary of State Wes Allen, Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture Rick Pate, businesswoman Nicole Wadsworth, former gubernatorial candidate Dean Odle and sheriff’s deputy Patrick Bishop. Qualifying for the midterm elections ends on Jan 23. 
Ensler acknowledges the uphill battle of winning a statewide office, despite flipping House District 74 in 2022. 
“I’m not running against someone, I’m running for something,” Ensler said in an interview before the event. “Whoever it is, we’re going to focus on the solutions and be laser focused on that, because that’s what people care about.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC_1139-scaled-e1768098281179-1024x612.jpg,,,2026-01-10 21:57:46.409962

Daricka Moore, a 24-year-old man related to at least four of the victims, is in custody charged with first-degree murder. He is being held without bail in the Clay County Jail in West Point.
Clay County Sheriff Eddie Scott said at a news conference Saturday that a cadre of state and local law enforcement arrested Moore at a safety checkpoint about a half mile from the second crime scene. The search included local officers and those from Mississippi Highway Patrol, the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation and the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics.
District Attorney Scott Colom said the charges could be upgraded to multiple counts of capital murder.
“I don’t know what kind of motive there could be to shoot a 7-year-old child,” Colom said.
The rampage began before 7 p.m. at a home on David Hill Road. Moore allegedly fatally shot his father, Glenn Moore, 67; uncle, Willie Guine, 55; and brother Quinten Moore, 33. Scott said each man was shot in the head.
Scott said the suspect stole Quinton Moore’s F150 truck and drove to the second crime scene, where he allegedly broke into the house and tried to sexually assault someone before killing the 7-year-old girl, whom the sheriff said identified as the suspect’s second cousin.
WTVA-TV reported that her family identified her as Mikiylia Guines.
The child’s mother and two other children were in the home. After the girl was killed, Moore allegedly put a gun to the head of another child, believed to be even younger, Scott said.
Scott said Moore then drove to a home on Siloam-Griffith Road, where investigators found the aluminum-colored truck hidden behind the house. That’s where they discovered the bodies of Barry Bradley and Samuel Bradley, who also apparently had been shot in the head. One of them was the pastor of an Apostolic church.

Scott said the family is experiencing overwhelming grief.
“For this family to lose this many family members in one setting is just hard to imagine,” Scott said.
Colom said that when the sheriff briefed him on what happened, “it really shook me. It’s the worst I’ve ever seen. Six people’s lives taken.”
Moore is scheduled for his first court appearance Monday in Clay County while investigators search for answers and the state Crime Lab begins running ballistics tests. 
“This guy has not been on our radar. We don’t know what was going through his mind,” Scott said.
He said gun violence is happening all across the country. This mass shooting comes less than three months after seven people were killed and many others were wounded in multiple shootings in Mississippi following high school and a college homecoming games.
Colom said the death penalty would have to be considered in this case. “If it’s eligible, you have to seek to seek the highest punishment under Mississippi law,” he said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/06100414/EddieScottDOYLE-26-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-10 20:57:08.875495

The marchers began at Powderhorn Park and passed by the site where Good was killed. The protest was part of over a 1,000 planned demonstrations against ICE across the nation this weekend.
Among the demonstrators was a group of Roosevelt High School students. Hours after ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good, Border Patrol agents arrived at the high school and deployed tear gas as students were being dismissed.
“I want to be able to go to work and school without worrying that we are going to be attacked,” said junior Maria Delong, who said she burst into tears watching a video of her favorite teachers being tackled by federal agents.

Fahad Mo, 26, is a Somali-American who grew up in Cedar-Riverside, which has a large Somali community. He’s part of the Cedar-Riverside Protection Alliance, a newly formed group working to protect the Somali community in the neighborhood from immigration officers.
“I want Trump to know Somali-Americans are always going to be here,” Mo said at the protest. “Immigrants are always going to be here.”
The Minnesota Somali community has been the focus of a targeted deportation campaign by the Trump administration since late November, even though the vast majority are citizens or legal residents.
Protests at the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, which federal immigration agents use as a base, has been more confrontational. Federal agents fired pepper balls at a small group of protesters at the Whipple Building at the same time as the much larger Powderhorn protest, CNN reported.
On Friday night, police arrested 30 people, who have since been released, for blocking streets and damaging property at a protest outside hotels in downtown Minneapolis where ICE agents are thought to be staying, the Star Tribune reported. The police said protesters caused about $6,000 in damage from broken windows and graffiti at the Depot Renaissance Hotel.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Protesters gathered around the downtown federal building in Nebraska’s capital city to demonstrate for justice after the shooting death of a Minnesota woman by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. 
Several hundred protesters gathered at Centennial Mall. Some chanted, “Immigrants are welcome here.” Others held anti-ICE signs as cars honked.  In addition to the protest in Lincoln, organizers said there was one demonstration in Omaha and three others across the state, part of national protests organized by Indivisible, a political and social organization that says it works to resist the Trump administration. 
The protests in Nebraska came after an ICE agent shot and killed a Minnesota woman and federal agents shot two people in Oregon this week.

Karen Burchard, a 53-year-old Lincoln resident, said she showed up to let people know that “we are living under authoritarian rule.”
“If [ICE] is bold enough to do that on the street, then what are they doing to our neighbors and friends that are detained?” Burchard asked. 
Another protester, a Lincoln resident who didn’t wish to disclose a name for fear of losing a job with the government, said people went to protest to “keep searching for the truth and accountability” from the Trump administration.
“I believe in this country,” the protester said. “I believe we’re going the wrong way.”

President Donald Trump and other federal officials have said the Minnesota agent had acted “in self-defense,” while Minnesota state officials have questioned federal accounts of the shooting as “propaganda” and blamed stepped-up immigration enforcement, expanded hiring and lax training. Minnesota investigators say they have been excluded from the investigation. 
A New York Times analysis of videos from three different angles shows the woman, 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, turning her SUV away from the ICE agent, who has been identified as Jonathan Ross, and that he was not in the path of her vehicle when he fired three shots at close range. 
Another video from the cellphone held by the agent who fatally shot Good appears to show him just to the side of the vehicle when he fires, according to footage published by Alpha News, a conservative news outlet. It was not immediately clear whether the SUV made contact with the officer or where the agent was standing when he fired the shots.

Another discussion point for protesters on Saturday was the shooting in Portland involving two people shot by federal agents a day after Good was shot and killed. 
Portland Police said the two people shot were tied to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The Department of Homeland Security claimed Luis David Nico Moncada, one of the two people shot, “weaponized” the vehicle against officers who shot in self-defense. 
Nebraska saw protests against federal immigration agents last year after an ICE raid on Glenn Valley Foods in Omaha sent people to a North Platte jail. 
U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican serving Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District, said this week that “it’s very important that we get the facts.” 
“We should take a deep breath,” Bacon told reporters. “Let’s investigate and let the judicial system work.”

The event was part of a nationwide wave of protests planned in the aftermath of the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis on Wednesday and a Border Patrol shooting in Portland on Thursday.
Organized by Indivisible Grand Junction, the “ICE Out For Good” protest drew hundreds of people to the Old County Courthouse in Grand Junction. It was billed as a silent protest to honor Good and remember others who have died in ICE custody under the Trump administration. Organizers listed the names of more than 30 people who have died while in ICE custody in 2025 and two, including Good, who have died this year.
Protesters demanded accountability for ICE and called for the agency to leave their communities.

Hundreds of people gathered at the Colorado Capitol in Denver on Friday night to protest Good’s killing. Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was from Colorado Springs and was living in Minneapolis.
Activists in Colorado Springs held a vigil for Good outside the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday night, an event that the Colorado Springs Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression said was to condemn her killing and “honor her life in her hometown.”



“She went to the same schools that we went to … she lived in the same neighborhoods that we lived in,” said Brandon Rincon, the group’s founder, according to Colorado Springs TV station KRDO. “It just makes us want to fight for her more.”
The Trump administration last year implemented mass deportation efforts, which have prompted a series of protests as aggressive enforcement methods resulted in a spike in arrests, including of people with no criminal record or charges, and questions about due process.
An “ICE Out” protest is planned for 9 a.m., Sunday, at the ICE Denver Field Office in Centennial.

Those are among the outcomes so far of the neighborhood process and design review for a desperately needed affordable housing project in Jamaica Plain. They are emblematic of Boston’s broken land use process, through which neighbors assert parochial interests to stymie needed housing development or impose additional costs and delays. Even when that development advances the city’s purported goals – goals that city leaders appear unwilling to expend political capital to advance.
Founded in 1860, Rogerson Communities provides assisted living, memory care services, and independent living opportunities to older adults in the Commonwealth. In the summer of 2024, Rogerson began meeting with neighbors near its 3.2-acre site on the Jamaicaway and in August it filed a Letter of Intent with the Boston Planning Department, announcing plans to redevelop a surface parking lot and a vacant single-family home.  
The first phase of the initial proposal sought to replace the lot with below-grade parking and construct a new building that would replace existing memory care and day programs, and add 71 units of affordable senior housing. The building would be seven stories tall, exceeding the three-story maximum under the zoning code, but still one story less than the eight-story building next door. As initially presented, the project offered outdoor space for community use, used passive housing construction, and collected and reused rainwater for landscaping.
Although there was some support from neighbors, opposition coalesced early last year around the three-legged stool of NIMBYism — traffic, parking and “neighborhood character” — as well as height and shadows.  
A few insisted they weren’t against affordable housing, just this project. The one near, if not quite in, their backyard. Predictably, the result was a revised and smaller project, reduced first to 67 and then to 41 units of affordable housing. Fewer people housed. Higher per-unit costs. A neighborhood’s physical character preserved at the expense of the additional housing needed to preserve its social fabric. 
The reduction in the number of units at the Rogerson-Beaufort project is not an anomaly. It is the order of business in Boston — where excessive public processes, an outdated and outsized zoning code, and the influence of an unrepresentative set of residents combine to choke the supply of housing at every turn. 
Thirty units may seem inconsequential, but cumulatively such reductions, which happen over and over when development projects are reviewed, exacerbate our desperate housing shortage. The result is a city that talks about solving its housing crisis but whose actions – collectively and individually – ensure the problem persists.
Rogerson Communities’ proposal would seem to check all the boxes that city officials purport to care about. It replaced a surface parking lot with new community space, trees, and much-needed housing. It added a significant number of new parking spaces via a garage. The design was thoughtful, the building attractive, and the traffic impacts minimal. Most importantly, the project promised homes for low-income seniors in a city where older residents face escalating housing costs. 
The neighbors who oppose this and other projects reflect the natural tendency of what Dartmouth economist William Fischel famously termed “homevoters” – the homeowners who dominate local politics and discourage higher density development they perceive as a threat to their property values. This phenomenon can be found not just in smaller suburban communities, but also in urban areas. 
Our zoning system should not pit neighborhoods against one another in a desire to resist new development. In a functioning system, a city would plan and zone in a manner that permits as-of-right future development in response to growth and changes in demand.
A recent study found that 58 percent of parcels in Boston are nonconforming with respect to floor-area ratio. In other words, most buildings that exist would not be legal to build today.
We are not simply failing to zone in a manner that permits needs development. We are zoning in a manner so restrictive that our current city, the one so many are so eager to preserve in amber, would be impossible to build today.
Boston’s development review process, while perhaps intended to advance  thoughtful, democratic decision-making, in practice reflects an ad hoc system of neighborhood vetoes. Those who attend meetings and submit comments are overwhelmingly older and more likely to own homes, consistent with the experience in other communities. Allowing informal neighborhood groups and the unrepresentative collection of individuals with time and flexibility to show up on a Tuesday night to shape or halt projects undermines the rule of law.  
Rather than reflecting some sort of democratic ideal of local control, Boston’s process empowers those who already have housing to block housing for those who do not. 
Maintaining the status quo benefits those who already own property and possess the resources to wield political power. As Mayor Wu herself wrote in her 2019 report Fixing Boston’s Broken Development Process, “A system of special approvals driven by influence disadvantages those without resources.” Yet the mayor has, after one full term, done little to move the city away from this system.  
Modest attempts to upzone neighborhoods have moved slowly. Development still depends upon a system of discretionary relief. So Boston approves more than 1,000 variance applications each year, compared with single- and double-digit numbers in far larger cities. We patch together a city through ad hoc determinations in which local interests dictate the outcome. Efforts to modernize the process focus on maintaining this community review of individual projects. 
Fixing Boston’s land use system requires more than tinkering at the margins. It demands a wholesale rethinking of how the city regulates land and how it decides what gets built and where. Zoning should, as its earliest proponents recognized, allow for development in response to present and future needs. Only then will it serve the general welfare that provides the legal basis for its existence.  
The city must limit the ability of individual residents and neighborhood groups to delay or downsize projects, as a Boston Globe editorial recently recognized. Public participation is valuable at the level of crafting policy and developing zoning; it should not govern case-by-case determinations regarding individual projects. Elected officials responsive to their constituents should set the course of development rather than self-appointed neighborhood representatives.   
Perhaps the plot of land across the street from my home in Jamaica Plain was not the best place in the city for 30 additional units of affordable housing. However, in a system where discretionary review determines what can be built, rather than as-of-right zoning implemented through a citywide process, no one is considering the broader context and adequately weighing the general welfare.  
The housing crisis is not inevitable. It is the direct result of choices—choices made in hearing rooms and zoning meetings, choices to privilege trees over people and process over progress. If Boston wants to live up to its ideals, it must choose differently.

The weekly demonstration organized by the local chapter of Indivisible, the national protest group, usually draws 60-100 people. But the crowd swelled after Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was shot during a Wednesday raid on the city’s immigrant community.
Portland resident Jen Boggs told those assembled that as an immigrant born in the Philippines, “I am afraid, and I am willing to bet that a lot of you are afraid here, too.”

“We are afraid and that is not fair. None of this is fair. We have laws, they don’t obey them. We have rights, they don’t observe them,” she said, imploring the crowd to be brave. “We are here together.” 
Many protesters held homemade signs denouncing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and President Donald Trump. Following similar deployments to Los Angeles, Chicago, and Portland, Oregon, the Trump administration sent more than 2,000 law enforcement officers to the Twin Cities in recent days. 
Part of that force was ICE agent Jonathan Ross, who Trump said was justified in shooting Good, contradicting video evidence of the encounter. Since the shooting, the administration said it is sending even more federal officers to the city.
ICE agents have also been spotted on the streets of Maine in recent weeks.
“Your ICE thugs can’t stop us. We’ll stand up side by side,” sang Cape Elizabeth resident Becky Bronson, adapting the lyrics of “All you fascists” by Woody Guthrie. “For everyone you’re hurting, for everyone who’s died. We’ll melt you down, get the f**k out of our town.”
Saturday’s rally is the second protest the city has seen since the Minneapolis shooting, echoing demonstrations across the country. On Thursday evening, hundreds gathered in downtown Portland for a vigil. Other rallies were planned elsewhere in Maine Saturday, including South Portland, Yarmouth, Bangor and Saco.
In a statement posted to her Senate campaign Facebook page Wednesday evening, Gov. Janet Mills called the shooting a “horrific tragedy” and said Trump “has weaponized ICE into an unaccountable, masked armed force deployed at his will to target those he opposes.”
“Maine cannot and will not turn a blind eye to ICE’s unacceptable actions,” she added, pointing to her recent announcement that she would allow legislation restricting local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement to become law. 
Molly Curren Rowles, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, said that the “level of brutality that we are seeing displayed by ICE is unprecedented.”
“I think when we see violations of law like this one, the extent of danger is really impalpable,” Curren Rowles said, adding that the demonstrations show that there’s “many people who realize, this is the time to speak up, and act up and get involved.”

Good was killed while acting as a legal observer, which Curren Rowles explained is a show “of solidarity for people who may not be personally affected to go and provide support and watch what’s happening and observe.”
Portland resident Kim Wells said, for her, Good represents “Americans who don’t necessarily have to come out and speak, protesting.” 
Wells, who stood on the roadside holding a homemade sign featuring a picture of Good, also pointed out that she isn’t the first person who has been killed by ICE. “Immigrants have been getting murdered for the last year, but it takes a middle class white woman for people to start uniting,” she said.
Asked how Mainers can keep themselves safe, Curren Rowles pointed to the ACLU’s many resources and said, “Knowing your rights is critically important.”
“We need to understand our rights in order to exercise them and also in order to make sure they don’t go away and advocate for them,” she said. “And this is the time to really do that.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/anti-ice-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-10 16:57:29.188735
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-10 21:01:29+00:00,CT Mirror,CT residents join ‘ICE Out for Good’ protests after fatal shooting of Renee Good,Reginald David and John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/10/ice-out-for-good-protests-ct-fairfield-fatal-shooting-renee-good/,Hundreds of people turned out to protest around CT on Saturday for the ICE Out for Good Weekend of Action.,"More than 100 people gathered outside the Home Depot on Grasmere Avenue in Fairfield late Saturday morning, filling the sidewalk with handmade signs, chants and the steady sound of car horns from drivers slowing down to show support.
For months, the big box store’s parking lot has been a familiar meeting spot. Since mid-October, a small but committed group of protesters has returned nearly every Saturday, standing near the main entrance with a large banner that reads, “Neighbors, Not ICE.”
“The first day it was just four of us, because that’s how many people it takes to hold the sign,” said Callie Heilmann, a co-director of Bridgeport Generation Now who has helped organize the protests since they began last fall.
That changed this week.
Following the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Heilmann said organizers put out a call on the organizing platform Mobilize, asking people to show up for an emergency protest as part of a nationwide “ICE Out For Good” Weekend of Action.
By Saturday morning, more than 100 people had signed up, roughly 10 times the typical turnout.
“This came together in 24 hours,” Heilmann said.

The protest began around 11 a.m., with demonstrators lining the sidewalk along Grasmere Avenue, holding signs that read “ICE Out for Good,” “Abolish ICE,” and “No Human Is Illegal.” As chants echoed across the parking lot, cars driving past honked repeatedly, some drivers raising fists or waving through open windows.
Organizers said the protest was part of a broader, grassroots response to what they describe as a pattern of unchecked violence and lack of accountability by federal immigration enforcement agencies.
On Wednesday, Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother, was killed during an encounter involving U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in Minneapolis. The shooting has sparked outrage across the country, with critics accusing the federal government of immediately defending the officers involved and failing to provide transparency or accountability.
Although there was a large turnout at the Fairfield event, the protest remained peaceful. The events were in contrast to a vigil two days earlier in Hartford in which a group of people confronted vehicles exiting a federal building on the other side of where a peaceful vigil was being held in reaction to Good’s death. 
The incident ended with one person being struck by a vehicle and at least half a dozen being pepper sprayed. Hartford officials said Friday they had a “strong suspicion” the people driving the vehicles involved in the encounter were federal employees.
Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam also said Friday that the events are being investigated by the local police and the Department of Homeland Security. He said the violence that occurred on Thursday night “is a direct result of the lawlessness and recklessness of the Trump administration that has occurred over the past year and that last night came here to the city of Hartford, that resulted earlier this week in the death of Renee Good in Minneapolis. That chaos that we saw last night didn’t come from the city of Hartford.”
Among those who answered the call to protest Saturday in Fairfield were Hillie McTernan, 38, and her friend Lisa Endo, 44, both of Fairfield.
McTernan said she and Endo have attended nearly a dozen “No Kings” events and other demonstrations opposing the Trump administration over the past year. Still, she said the response to the fatal shooting of Good felt different, and deeply alarming.
“It feels like it could happen to anyone now,” McTernan said. “The government response was just complete defense of the officers. That’s horrifying.”

Nearby, Karen Butler, an 81-year-old Norwalk resident, stood holding a sign that read “ICE Out for Good,” decorated with an illustration of a woman created by a Chicago-based artist. Butler described herself as a veteran of recent protests but said the moment felt darker than others she had experienced.
“My earlier signs were too kind,” Butler said. “I’m defending democracy. I never thought it would end up like this.”
Saturday’s rally was one of hundreds planned nationwide as part of the ICE Out for Good Weekend of Action. Organizers said protests were scheduled in cities and towns across the country, including roughly a dozen locations in Connecticut such as Brookfield, Torrington and New London.
For many who attended the Fairfield protest, Good’s death raised fears not just about immigration enforcement, but about public safety and the rule of law more broadly.
Sonya Huber, 54, of Stratford, said the incident sent a chilling message to communities already feeling vulnerable.
“I don’t know who among us is safe,” Huber said. “If we’re coming to a protest, I think it represents a complete disregard for the rule of law and the safety of residents and citizens.”
She added that the shooting has had a ripple effect far beyond Minnesota.
“It’s a major alarm bell among thousands,” Huber said. “It strikes fear in those who are willing to stand up for the most vulnerable.”
Mike Martinez, 26, a Shelton resident, said he came to the protest out of frustration and anger, describing the fatal shooting as part of a broader erosion of democratic norms.
“The slaughter of American citizens under this administration is just beyond incomprehensible,” Martinez said. “How we let this happen after Jan. 6, five years ago, is an indictment on us as a nation, and especially the 50% who voted.”
When asked what message he hoped the protest would send, Martinez said unity was central.
“That we’re going to stand united,” he said. “This is inhumane, and we’re not going to allow it. We’re not going to allow fascists to rule this country.”
He added that the size of the crowd was itself a statement.
“The half of the country that opposes this administration is louder than the half that supports it,” Martinez said.

Bridgeport resident Litzy Leon, 25, said she felt compelled to attend after learning more details about Good’s death.
“I just feel like it’s absurd that we’re allowing a murderer free only because he holds the title of ICE agent,” Leon said. “She wasn’t even doing anything wrong, she was just driving away. There was no attack on the agent.”
Leon said the incident also raised concerns about gun use and accountability within federal agencies.
“The gun control is just crazy,” she said.
When asked what kind of accountability protesters are calling for, Leon said the demands are basic, but urgent.
“At the very minimum, we need to see a trial,” she said. “An investigation needs to be held. A trial needs to happen. All respect towards Renee.”
Throughout the protest, speakers rotated through a megaphone, leading chants and urging passersby to learn more about immigration enforcement practices and how to support impacted communities.

Mayor Mary Sheffield made Pershing High School the first stop after her public swearing-in ceremony on Friday.
The stop at the Detroit Public Schools Community District’s neighborhood school reflected her campaign promise to focus her term on initiatives that will improve the lives of young people.
Lines of cheerleaders and a hallway booming with applause greeted Sheffield. As students and adults clamored to point their cellphone cameras at the mayor when she walked in, girls talked to each other about how excited they were to meet the city’s first female mayor.
“I’m very grateful to be in the presence of such a person,” said senior Neveah Washington.
Sheffield, who was sworn in during a private ceremony on Jan. 1, spent 30 minutes with nearly 90 students in the school’s library. She talked about partnering with the city’s schools to address systemic issues that affect the quality of students’ education, from improving city transportation to offering more after-school programming and wraparound services.
The mayor said she also wants to give youth reasons to stay in Detroit, such as more career opportunities and affordable housing.
Though the mayor does not have control over schools, Sheffield told the students, “that does not mean that the mayor cannot be a great partner, that we cannot be visible and hands-on with our youth – and that is what I intend to do.”
Education became a key issue in the mayor’s race as more advocates pushed for the office to address underlying systemic challenges that contribute to poor academic performance and chronic absenteeism in the city’s schools.
Superintendent Nikolai Vitti told the students that Sheffield’s presence at the school reflects her interest in investing in opportunities that will benefit neighborhood schools.
“Being here at Pershing, being here at DPSCD, in a traditional public school, and a neighborhood school on the east side, all of that is intentional,” he said. “If we don’t have strong neighborhood schools, you can’t have a strong city.”
Sheffield told the students she is creating the city’s first youth department. Jerjuan Howard, the city’s new director of youth affairs, said each department in the mayor’s office will make a “youth priority statement” to detail how decisions may affect young people.
“What that means is that you all will be at the center of decision making for anything the city is talking about moving forward,” he said. “No other city in the nation has done this yet.”
Sheffield talked to the students one-on-one and collected their written questions.
DeAngelo Allen, a junior who takes a city bus to school every day, asked Sheffield how she will improve the city’s transportation. Allen said he is often late to school because the buses he relies on either come far earlier or later than their scheduled times.
The teen said he feels like he has to be vigilant about safety when he rides the bus.
“You have to watch your surroundings,” he said. “You see some pretty disturbing stuff.”
Mac Sconi, 17, asked Sheffield how she will address safety concerns – an issue many students say affects their ability to learn and get to school.
The teen said he was optimistic about the response he got from the mayor after she expressed she would take a holistic approach to improving safety with crime prevention programs. The city’s new neighborhood and community safety office will promote long-term solutions like mental health and conflict resolution programs, Sheffield added.
“There’s a lot of things right now that are threatening the safety of our students,” Sconi said. “It’s something that needs to be addressed, because what is the importance of anything if we are not safe?”

(Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA)Republican Greg Ford maintained a 21-vote lead in an automatic recount Friday to win a special election for a state House seat in Dorchester County.
The retired Air force veteran fills the last vacancy in the Legislature just ahead of Tuesday’s start to the 2026 session.
The numbers didn’t change with the recount, which state law requires if less than 1 percentage point separates the candidates.
Ford won 50.2% of 3,440 votes in the Tuesday special election, while Democrat Sonja Ogletree Satani won 49.6%. Five voters wrote in someone else’s name. Just over 14% of the district’s registered voters cast a ballot, according to results certified by the state Election Commission.
The special election fills the remainder of former Rep. Chris Murphy’s term.
Both Ford and Ogletree Satani told the SC Daily Gazette they intend to run again for the next full term. So, there could be a rematch in November, depending on the outcome of the June primaries.
Murphy, a former House Judiciary chairman, submitted his resignation in August, though it didn’t go into effect until Monday. He was first elected in 2010 and replaced longtime Republican Rep. Annette Young, who retired after 20 years in the House.
Ogletree Satani previously ran against Murphy in 2024. That race wasn’t nearly as close: Murphy won re-election by 14 percentage points.
Ford and Ogletree Satani each faced two opponents in their primaries. The Republican primary went to a runoff, which Ford won with 56% of the vote.
The Dorchester County race was the last of four special elections for Statehouse seats since the end of the 2025 legislative session.
Three special elections were held two days before Christmas. Republicans won all of them, though that was essentially a given for two of them.
In the only race with a Democrat on the ballot, Lexington County pastor John Lastinger won with 62% of the vote to replace ex-Rep. RJ May, who is set to be sentenced next week after pleading guilty to distributing videos of children being sexually abused. About 11% of that district’s registered voters cast ballots in that Dec. 23 special election, according to the state Election Commission.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/statehouse-roof-and-flags-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-10 10:58:12.719364

(Peru Ministry of Environment)This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.
Daniele Visioni sometimes worries he may be labelled an enemy of the state.
Visioni, a climate scientist and assistant professor at Cornell University, is an Italian-born scholar who will serve as an author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s upcoming Seventh Assessment Report, a document outlining the latest science on climate change, to be published by an international body the Trump administration has now announced the U.S. government will abandon.





Daniele Visioni is a climate scientist and assistant professor at Cornell University. (Cornell University)
“If the U.S. decides that any IPCC author is an enemy of the state, that probably means they can keep me out of the country,” said Visioni, who has had difficult conversations about the possibility with his husband and colleagues. “But when I agreed to be an author in this cycle, I was aware of this risk.”
Visioni is among the many climate scientists who say that the Trump administration’s plan to leave the IPCC and withdraw from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is damaging to the scientific community and to the United States’ reputation on the world stage.
Leading climate scientists, many of whom have co-authored IPCC reports, told Inside Climate News that though they believe the administration’s move is troubling, U.S. scientists are committed to advancing climate research, including by fully participating in future IPCC proceedings.


Michael Oppenheimer, a longtime participant in the IPCC, served as a review editor for the body’s Sixth Assessment Report. He was among a group of IPCC scientists awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.


He said the government’s withdrawal from the IPCC should be seen within the broader context of attacks on science pursued by the Trump administration.
“It’s part of the pattern of trying to destroy climate science,” Oppenheimer said.
But the U.S. withdrawal doesn’t serve either American or global interests, he said.

“This kind of action is part of a very large threat to U.S. climate science,” Oppenheimer said. “And that’s not good, not just from the selfish U.S. perspective. This is part of taking the U.S. out of the game—out of the process—and that’s not good for the U.S. and it’s not good for the world.”


Pamela McElwee of Rutgers University said that climate scientists have been working behind the scenes in anticipation of a move like this to ensure that the science—and the contributions of U.S. scientists to an international dialogue on climate change—will continue.





“I was disappointed by the announcement, but not surprised,” said McElwee, who served as co-chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services’ Nexus assessment from 2021-2024. “We knew the handwriting was on the wall.”
She said that the U.S. is putting itself and its interests at a disadvantage by abandoning the international agreements.
“It’s shooting ourselves in the foot that we’re not going to be able to influence the policy implications,” she said. “So this idea that the U.S. is somehow better off not even being part of the international community on this is clearly just not true on the face of it.”


Libby Jewett, like Visioni, is set to be an author on the IPCC’s next assessment.
Jewett, a marine ecologist who founded the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s ocean acidification program before retiring in early 2025, said the decision to leave the panel undermines the role of the U.S. as well as its impact on climate science.
“We have traditionally been a global powerhouse on climate science, and we have a lot to contribute,” Jewett said. “And the U.S. pulling out just means we’ll have less of a say in how these processes move forward.”


Pamela McElwee is a professor in the Department of Human Ecology at Rutgers University. (Rutgers University)
Visioni said, however, that a lack of U.S. involvement in producing the IPCC’s recommendations for policymakers may be somewhat of a silver lining.
“By withdrawing from all these agreements, the U.S. is not stopping them. It is not stopping U.S. scientists from participating in them,” he said. “The only thing that this government is doing is depriving themselves of the opportunity to influence these reports in any way.”
Pulling out of the IPCC, he said, would prevent the Trump administration from potentially advancing fossil fuel interests in the IPCC assessment’s recommendations to policymakers, which are negotiated between countries.


Oppenheimer said he has a more optimistic view of the IPCC process, which he feels is accustomed to dealing with fossil-fueled actors.
“I think the IPCC process is a good one,” he said. “That’s one reason it’s a damn shame that the U.S. government has decided to withdraw.”
John Christy, Alabama’s state climatologist and a professor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, said in a written statement to Inside Climate News that there’s “not much to say” about the administration’s decision. The Trump White House has often turned to Christy, who has questioned mainstream climate science, denying the widely-accepted link between carbon emissions and rising global temperatures.
“The IPCC at times produced some reasonable documents, but it was clearly a U.N. bureaucratic organization designed for a policy outcome—the elimination of hydrocarbons,” Christy’s statement said. “I believe this having been a lead author and witnessing the overwhelming bias of those selected as authors.”
Countries continue to turn to fossil fuels, he said, because they “work tremendously well and are affordable.” Countries like England and Germany and states like California and New York that have emphasized growth in renewable energy are “regressing,” he said, and need to “figure this out before they find themselves in the Dark Ages (again).”
Renewable energy now represents the lion’s share of new electricity sources worldwide as costs drop. That raises economic risks for a country doubling down on fossil fuels.

The denigration of science and scientists worries Anna Harper, a University of Georgia climate scientist and IPCC author. Cuts to agencies like NOAA and attacks on global bodies like the IPCC undermine the public’s trust in science and the global community’s trust in the U.S, she said.
“It’s discouraging to see institutions that we’ve all relied on for sound science—institutions that scientists believe are helping Americans—be dismantled,” she said.
The attacks come at a cost. Like Visioni, Harper worries it’s becoming harder to do the work of climate science.
“The same wording has crossed my mind,” she said of Visioni’s comments. “Are we enemies of the state now?”
Despite the political environment, scientists like Rutgers’ McElwee said it’s important that the academic community work together to ensure that policymakers receive the latest, most thorough scholarship on globally important issues like climate change. Individual scientists, universities and other organizations must aim to fill the gaps left by the United States’ withered commitments, she said.
So far, they’re stepping up.
In the context of the IPCC, for example, the U.S. Academic Alliance for the IPCC and the American Geophysical Union have worked together to guarantee the continued participation of U.S. scientists in the panel’s proceedings.
“Our work will continue,” McElwee said. “It has to.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Panel-on-Climate-Change-Peru-Oct-27-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-10 08:12:15.642115

Some of the bills that have already been filed show that in addition to deciding the fate of property taxes, lawmakers will also be revisiting some old topics.
Listening to the sound of silencers
One of those familiar topics will be an attempt to find a new way to embrace the Second Amendment. A pre-filed bill from Sen. Casey Crabtree, a Madison Republican, would ensure that federal regulations on silencers wouldn’t be enforced in South Dakota.

See all of Searchlight’s coverage of the 2026 legislative session.
Read the latest > 


Senate Bill 2 seeks to take silencers off the “controlled weapons” list where it currently exists with the likes of machine guns and sawed-off shotguns. Despite the Second Amendment’s popularity in South Dakota and the Legislature, this may be an uphill fight for Crabtree, because the portrayal of silencers in popular culture isn’t good. We usually see someone in the movies or on TV using a silencer when they’re committing a crime.
It may also be tough for Crabtree to explain why law-abiding citizens need to silence their weapons. Maybe, if you’re trying to pick off wildlife or stray cats and dogs in your backyard, you don’t want to alert authorities with gunshots. If you’re using a weapon to defend your home, maybe you don’t want to wake the neighbors when shots are fired.
Another attempt to add more limits to term limits
Since 1992, when voters in this state decided it was a good idea to limit the terms of legislators, there have been various attempts to limit them even more. Currently a lawmaker can serve no more than four terms or eight consecutive years in one chamber. Candidates got around that restriction by, after four terms, running for office in the other chamber.
Senate Joint Resolution 501 seeks to change that with a vote of the people. SJR 501, sponsored by Aberdeen Republican Michael Rohl, seeks a state constitutional amendment that would limit lawmakers to eight consecutive years in one chamber, then make them sit out two years before they could make a run at a seat in the other chamber, where they could only serve four consecutive terms.
Since 1992 when legislative terms were limited, lawmakers have been flipping and flopping from one chamber to the other every eight years. If approved by voters, Rhol’s resolution would make sure that veteran lawmakers would have to sit on the bench for two years before they could seek a seat in the other chamber. Two years on the sidelines may not appeal to his colleagues. What term limit backers often forget is that voters have the ultimate say on who serves them. No matter what the law says about consecutive terms, voters control term limits.
Yet another attempt to call for a constitutional convention
Rohl is also the sponsor of Senate Joint Resolution 502, which calls for a national constitutional convention. The subject of the convention would be enshrining in the U.S. Constitution a limit on the number of Supreme Court justices.
The current court membership of nine is set by Congress, and Rohl wants to keep it that way. Rohl must be afraid that if Democrats were to somehow gain control of both houses of Congress and the White House, they could change the number to something that benefited them, upping the number of justices on the court who would then be appointed by a Democratic president and would be more likely to favor left-leaning issues.
Just about every year there are resolutions like Rohl’s, though his has the advantage of calling for a unique change in the Constitution. Usually the resolutions are of a more generic nature, calling for a convention that would deal with fiscal restraints or limits to federal power or congressional term limits, or all three.
The bad news for Rohl is that those attempts to call for a constitutional convention rarely succeed in this Legislature. In the past five sessions, the vast majority of resolutions calling for a constitutional convention have been killed in committee or failed in one chamber or the other. With a record of one win and 10 losses in the past five sessions, it’s obvious that a majority of lawmakers recognize those resolutions as a waste of time.

He hasn’t gotten all of them yet, but allies at the state level have ensured that his agenda will progress anyway.
Election reform is a fixation for the president. He regularly posts on social media about elections, from conspiracies about Venezuela’s role in the 2020 election to allegations of voter fraud in California, where he says an investigation has begun. Trump habitually claims the 2020 election was stolen from him.
“Our elections are crooked as hell,” Trump told House Republicans earlier this week.

Many of the election reforms on the Republican Party’s wishlist — like nationwide proof-of-citizenship requirements and paper ballots — have yet to come to fruition. The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, which Trump on Monday encouraged members of Congress to pass, has no path forward in the Senate. In 2025, Trump signed an executive order making changes to the federal elections process. The most significant changes it attempted to make have been blocked by the courts.
For example, the League of Women Voters sued the Trump administration over part of that executive order which sought to require proof of citizenship to register to vote. Due to the lawsuit, the directive never went into effect.
But for every win opponents of these measures secure, Trump’s election agenda is still being implemented in other ways at the state level, through either the courts or legislatures, Caren Short, the director of legal and research for the League of Women Voters, told NOTUS. Short described it as intentionally “overwhelming.”
“There aren’t enough attorneys to challenge every single restrictive law in every single state. There’s so many of them,” she said. “And so, some of these are going into place.”
In a statement to NOTUS, the White House acknowledged that sweeping nationwide reform has been difficult. “This process takes time, especially given strong opposition from blue states, with notoriously bad voter roll maintenance,” spokesperson Abigail Jackson said.
But both the White House and the Republican National Committee pointed to successes at the state level.
At the RNC, efforts have been ongoing for years. The committee has challenged election laws in New York and other states, and backed states in their fights to maintain Republican-aligned voting laws.
The RNC joined the Mississippi Republican Party in suing the state over its absentee ballot receipt deadline, arguing that only ballots received by Election Day should be counted. It has led to a pending Supreme Court hearing, with a decision expected as early as this summer. If the RNC is successful, absentee ballots will have to be received on or before Election Day, a deviation from rules in as many as 30 states and the District of Columbia.
It’s one of 115 election-related lawsuits the RNC said it filed last year.
“While Democrats block commonsense reforms, Republicans are strengthening voter ID, enforcing citizenship requirements, protecting mail-in ballot safeguards, and cleaning voter rolls to ensure secure, fair midterm elections,” RNC spokesperson Kiersten Pels said in a statement.
The Trump administration has used the Department of Justice to compel blue states to cooperate with efforts to purge voter rolls. Dozens of states have been hit with lawsuits over confidential voter information, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a progressive law and public policy institute.
States willing to work with the Trump administration have used U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ SAVE database to verify that voters are citizens. In Texas, 2,700 registered voters were flagged as “potential noncitizens” and removed. A 2024 ProPublica investigation found that Gov. Greg Abbott’s claims about noncitizens on Texas voter rolls appeared inflated and, in some cases, wrong.
Jason Snead, the executive director of the Honest Elections Project, a conservative nonprofit that has worked with state legislatures on election reform, says the Trump administration has improved the accessibility of federal records for states that want to cross-reference them with their voter rolls.
“That’s one of the areas where the Trump administration has really done incredible work, making that a tool that states can and are using to identify noncitizens on the rolls, and I give them a lot of credit for making that an early priority of the Trump administration,” he told NOTUS.
The progress made by Republicans and the Trump administration means that elections, especially in red states where change has been more swift, will look different this year. In addition to potential legal changes due to Supreme Court rulings and changes to how mail is postmarked, state legislatures have passed reforms too.
And even without the SAVE Act, some state legislatures have passed laws this year requiring voters to present proof of citizenship.
While Republicans say elections are more secure for it, voter-access advocates worry Trump and Republicans are fast-tracking efforts to make elections even more difficult to access for people who have been historically disenfranchised.
“Our legislators and our leaders should be thinking about how they can make voting more accessible, expanding to more voters, and instead, they’re focused on: How do we restrict the electorate even more than it is now? How do we add burdens?” Short said. “I would argue that they are achieving a lot of what they are setting out to do.”

Sam Brownback cut income taxes with promises of economic growth. Instead, the state faced years of budget shortfalls, education cuts, and credit downgrades. Just five years later, the Republican-controlled legislature voted to override Brownback’s veto and restore the income tax. 
Missouri is now debating a similar tax path at the same moment a major source of federal health care assistance is being withdrawn.
Enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies have expired for approximately 417,000 Missourians after Congress adjourned without extending them. Those subsidies have been a key reason marketplace coverage remained affordable for middle-income families over the past several years.
According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, expiration of the enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies would more than double what subsidized enrollees pay for coverage on average. Annual premium payments are projected to rise from $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026 — an increase of $1,016, or 114%. 
For many middle-income households, that increase alone exceeds the annual income tax savings being promised under Missouri’s tax proposals. 
According to December estimates, state revenue is running roughly $400 million below projections, largely due to the capital gains tax exemption enacted earlier this year which is now estimated to cost around $500 million annually — far more than originally forecast.
Gov. Mike Kehoe has made eliminating Missouri’s income tax his top priority for 2026, arguing that lower taxes will put more money in Missourians’ pockets and attract businesses. But for households losing ACA subsidies, health care costs are projected to rise by more than $1,000 a year at the same time tax savings are measured in the hundreds.
Analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy shows that about two-thirds of the capital gains tax exemption benefits flow to the top 1% of earners. The average millionaire saves roughly $43,000 a year. Working families save about $80. Those least affected by rising healthcare costs receive the largest tax benefits, while families facing four-figure premium increases see little relief.
Kansas’s experience offers a cautionary example of how aggressive tax cuts can erode state revenue and shift costs onto public services relied on by families and employers alike.
State leaders are now proposing to eliminate the income tax entirely — a revenue source that generates about $8.7 billion annually and accounts for roughly two-thirds of Missouri’s general revenue. That money supports core services, including public schools, Medicaid, mental health care and child protection.
Kehoe and House Speaker Jon Patterson say their approach will avoid Kansas’s mistakes through gradual phase-ins and fiscal guardrails. The full proposal is expected to be revealed during the governor’s State of the State address next week.
For several years, Missouri has had historically large reserves. The surplus peaked at nearly $8 billion in June 2023. Large sums have been set aside for improvements to Interstates 70 and 44, a major expansion of the Capitol Building, and construction projects on college campuses and elsewhere. But one-time reserves cannot offset ongoing annual losses from permanent tax cuts or recurring health care cost increases.
Missourians need clear answers to basic questions: Which state and local services would be reduced or eliminated, and by how much? What revenue sources would replace $8.7 billion in annual income tax revenue? And what assumptions about economic growth and revenue replacement underpin the proposed phase-ins?
Without answers to these questions, it’s impossible to distinguish responsible restructuring from a high-stakes experiment undertaken amid existing fiscal pressure.
States without income taxes typically rely on oil and gas royalties or significantly higher sales and property taxes — revenue sources Missouri lacks.
According to Becker’s Hospital Review’s December 2025 analysis of Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform data, 29 of Missouri’s rural hospitals are already at risk of closure, including 12 at immediate risk within the next two or three years.
Marketplace coverage has become a major source of insurance across much of the state. Analysis from Washington University shows that in most Missouri counties, growth in ACA marketplace enrollment outpaced Medicaid enrollment during the expansion period.
As subsidies expire, more Missourians are likely to delay or forgo coverage, increasing uncompensated care hospitals are legally required to provide. Reductions in state revenue place additional pressure on Medicaid funding that rural hospitals depend on, threatening to accelerate closures and leave some communities without local emergency or maternity care.
Each dollar Missouri spends on traditional Medicaid draws roughly $1.80 in federal matching funds. For Medicaid expansion enrollees, the federal government covers about 90% of costs, leaving the state responsible for roughly 10%.
In December, U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley broke with his party to support extending the enhanced subsidies, citing families fearful of losing affordable coverage. Missouri’s state leadership, meanwhile, remains focused on advancing income tax elimination.
For many Missouri families losing ACA subsidies in 2026, projected healthcare cost increases exceed the tax savings being proposed — at the same time Missouri’s general revenue is already running below projections, limiting the state’s ability to absorb additional health care and coverage costs.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/money-e1750989760274-1024x614.jpeg,,,2026-01-10 07:12:15.826939

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minneapolis is once again the focus of debates about violence involving law enforcement after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother, in her car.
The incident quickly prompted dueling narratives. Trump administration officials defended the shooting as justified, while local officials condemned it.
The shooting will also likely prompt renewed scrutiny of training and policy of officers and the question of them shooting at moving vehicles. There has been a recent trend in law enforcement toward policies that prohibit such shootings. It is a policy shift that has shown promise in saving lives.
Decades ago, the New York City Police Department prohibited its officers from shooting at moving vehicles. That led to a drop in police killings without putting officers in greater danger.
Debates over deadly force are often contentious, but as I note in my research on police ethics and policy, for the most part there is consensus on one point: Policing should reflect a commitment to valuing human life and prioritizing its protection. Many use-of-force policies adopted by police departments endorse that principle.
Yet, as in Minneapolis, controversial law enforcement killings continue to occur. Not all agencies have implemented prohibitions on shooting at vehicles. Even in agencies that have, some policies are weak or ambiguous.
In addition, explicit prohibitions on shooting at vehicles are largely absent from the law, which means that officers responsible for fatal shootings of drivers that appear to violate departmental policies often escape criminal penalties.
In the case of ICE, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, its policy on shooting at moving vehicles — unlike that of many police agencies — lacks a clear instruction for officers to get out of the way of moving vehicles where feasible. It’s an omission at odds with generally recognized best practices in policing.
 
ICE’s policy on shooting at moving vehicles
ICE’s current use-of-force policy prohibits its officers from “discharging firearms at the operator of a moving vehicle” unless it is necessary to stop a grave threat. The policy is explicit that deadly force should not be used “solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing suspect.”
That point is relevant for evaluating the fatal shooting in Minneapolis. Videos show one officer trying to open the door of the vehicle that Good was driving, while another officer appears to be in front of the vehicle as she tried to pull away.
Shooting to prevent the driver simply from getting away would have been in violation of agency policy and obviously inconsistent with prioritizing the protection of life.
ICE’s policy lacks clear instruction, however, for its officers to get out of the way of moving vehicles where feasible. In contrast, the Department of Justice’s use-of-force policy makes it explicit that officers should not shoot at a vehicle if they can protect themselves by “moving out of the path of the vehicle.”
Notably, President Joe Biden issued an executive order in 2022 requiring federal law enforcement agencies — like ICE — to adopt use-of-force policies “that are equivalent to, or exceed, the requirements” of the Department of Justice’s policy.
Despite that order, the provision to step out of the way of moving cars never made it into the use-of-force policy that applies to ICE.
 
The rationale for not shooting at moving vehicles
Prioritizing the protection of life doesn’t rule out deadly force. Sometimes such force is necessary to protect lives from a grave threat, such as an active shooter. But it does rule out using deadly force when less harmful tactics can stop a threat. In such cases, deadly force is unnecessary — a key consideration in law and ethics that can render force unjustified.
That’s the concern involved with police shooting at moving vehicles. It often is not necessary because officers have a less harmful option to avoid a moving vehicle’s threat: stepping out of the way.
This guidance has the safety of both suspects and police in mind. Obviously, police not shooting lowers the risk of harm to the suspect. But it also lowers the risk to the officer in the vast majority of cases because of the laws of physics. If you shoot the driver of a car barreling toward you, that rarely brings a car to an immediate stop, and the vehicle often continues on its path.
Many police departments have incorporated these insights into their policies. A recent analysis of police department policies in the 100 largest U.S. cities found that close to three-quarters of them have prohibitions against shooting at moving vehicles.
 
The gap between policy and best practices for protecting life
The shooting in Minneapolis serves as a stark reminder of the stubborn gap that persists between law and policy on the one hand and best law enforcement practices for protecting life on the other. When steps are taken to close that gap, however, they can have a meaningful impact.

Some of the most compelling examples involve local, state and federal measures that reinforce one another. Consider the “fleeing felon rule,” which used to allow police to shoot a fleeing felony suspect to prevent their escape even when the suspect posed no danger to others.
That rule was at odds with the doctrine of prioritizing the protection of life, leading some departments to revise their use-of-force policies and some states to ban the rule. In 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional for police to shoot a fleeing suspect who was not a danger.
Banning that questionable tactic notably led to a reduction in killings by police.
This history suggests that clear bans in law and policy on questionable tactics have the potential to save lives, while also strengthening the means for holding officers accountable.

(Photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Maryland overpaid $807.4 million in unemployment benefits since the COVID-19 pandemic and missed the opportunity to recover $760 million of that amount because it took to long do to so, state auditors said.
The report published Friday by the Office of Legislative Audits covered unemployment benefit paid out between Nov. 16, 2020, and Jan. 15, 2025, when states were flush with federal cash to help them through the pandemic and the sudden and historic loss of jobs that came with it. The chance to collect many of those overpayments passed in May 2025, the auditors said.
“That is quite concerning to me when we are not good stewards of taxpayer money,” said Sen. Shelly Hettleman (D-Baltimore County), co-chair of the Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee. “We have a (budget) shortfall, and we need to make sure that our money is spent on the priorities and the values we adhere to.”
Labor Secretary Portia Wu said her department takes the findings of the audit “very seriously” and that it is working to recover as much as it can going forward. But she also noted that “about 90%” of the unrecoverable overpayments would have fallen under the administration of Gov. Larry Hogan (R), and that much of the money involved would not have been state funds, but federal money that states received during the pandemic.
“We had been working on addressing these underlying problems far before these audit findings,” Wu said Friday, noting that the department has recovered “over $500 million in fraudulent, overpaid claims in 2025” and is “pursuing another $1.3 billion in overpayments.”
Labor secretary raises concerns about solvency of state unemployment fund

The Labor Department’s Division of Unemployment Insurance collects unemployment insurance taxes from employers and distributes unemployment benefits. The department explains on its website that “overpayments can occur for several reasons, including unreported wages, changes in work availability, or identity theft or fraud committed by a third party, which was particularly an issue during the COVID-19 pandemic.”
During the pandemic, the federal government offered states additional money to help keep up with surging unemployment claims at the time.
“We all know that the unemployment system had enormous, enormous strains during COVID and it just wasn’t functional in the way it needed to be during that crisis,” Hettleman said. “And then there were lots of starts and stops to get it up and running, and then there were legal issues and lots of concerns about fraud.”
State auditors found that the unemployment division “did not timely pursue recovery of claimant overpayments totaling $807.4 million resulting in up to $760.7 million that is no longer collectable as of May 2025.”
The labor department argues that the unrecoverable overpayments are closer to $600 million. Wu also noted that part of the collection of those overpayments were stalled in January 2022 by a legal challenge, which did not lift until September 2023.
But the audit notes that the department did not have “sufficient” overpayment collection even after the suspension ended, “resulting in an additional $33.6 million in overpayments not being adequately pursued.”
In response, the department said there was “necessary back-end work to resume collection activities” which led to additional delays after the suspension was lifted.
“Many of these issues, I think it’s over 90% of these overpayments were prior to this administration and during the pandemic,” Wu said. “Many of them may have been fraudulent. I can’t go back in time to change what was done. But I think we’re focused on doing our very best to recover as much as possible going forward.
“Some of these unpursued claims are very old. So even if we had been able to take action slightly earlier, many of these payments are not recoverable because they’re older,” Wu said.
“Obviously if actions had been taken closer in time to those overpayments, perhaps more of them could have been recovered. But I couldn’t have taken any action before that, before that 2023 window,” when the legal suspension was lifted, she said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Meanwhile, some Marylanders are getting hit with notices saying that they owe money to the state for unemployment benefits, some that date back during the COVID-19 pandemic years.
Wu acknowledges that the notices from so far back are likely leading to confusion among Marylanders, especially those who may have been subjected to identity theft and fraud, which was prevalent during the pandemic.
The audit comes just days before the start of the 2026 General Assembly, when lawmakers will be grappling with an estimated $1.6 billion deficit as they prepare the fiscal 2027 budget.
It’s not clear how much the unrecoverable funds were lost state dollars. Wu says that that most of the lost funds were federal COVID-19 assistance, so the lost dollars would “not impact” the Maryland unemployment insurance fund.
“Because of the overwhelming majority of benefits during that time were special federal benefits, even if they are recovered, they go immediately back to the U.S. Treasury,” she said.
Hettleman is skeptical, especially as the state faces a $1.6 billion budget shortfall. Every state dollar counts.
“There was quite a bit of delay in trying to get that money back and determine whether the state actually overpaid people,” she said. “I still have concerns in why did it take so long for the department to take some action to address those issues. And I don’t have a good answer to that right now, but we will try to get one.”
The audit also found additional oversight issues involving potentially fraudulent unemployment benefit payments, as well as two cyber security-related findings that are redacted from public view.

(Photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)As Maryland’s General Assembly convenes its 448th session on Jan. 14, state lawmakers face enormous challenges that demand more cooperation and less confrontation. Continued political acrimony will get us nowhere.
If polarization remains our default mode of governance, Maryland, and the nation, will pay the price. It is time to stop ignoring those with whom we disagree and start rebuilding the quiet, essential skill that democracy depends on — compromise.
Politics has always been the art of reconciling competing interests for the greater good. Otto von Bismarck, Germany’s first chancellor, famously called politics “the art of the possible.” That phrase captures a truth we seem to have forgotten, that progress in a representative government does not come from ideological purity but from pragmatic dealmaking. People elect leaders not to win arguments, but to solve problems.
And there are plenty of problems in need of solving. Maryland enters this legislative session with a projected $1.4 billion budget gap and mounting financial pressures. Inflation continues to drive up the cost of goods, services and government programs such as Medicaid. Tariffs on imported materials, still affecting manufacturing and construction sectors, have added strain.
Meanwhile, local economies struggle, schools need reform and households face affordability challenges in everything from housing to health care. These issues cross political boundaries. They demand balanced, thoughtful solutions, not partisan trench warfare.

Unfortunately, the political climate across the country has grown toxic. Too often, lawmakers and citizens alike treat compromise as betrayal. But real political maturity means recognizing that democracy is not a zero-sum game. The late President Ronald Reagan, no stranger to battles over policy, put it plainly: “I’d rather get 80% of what I want than go over the cliff with my flag flying.”
His wisdom rings true today. Refusing to settle for anything less than total victory undermines both progress and public trust.
Effective governance requires legislators to listen, even to those they profoundly disagree with. Maryland’s elected leaders must resist the easy path of partisan posturing and instead engage in the hard, necessary work of consensus-building. They will soon have to make tough choices about spending priorities, economic growth, and investment in education, transportation and public safety. These choices will not please everyone. Yet, the measure of success should not be which side “wins” the argument, but whether Marylanders are better off once the legislative dust settles.
Partisan bickering is not strategy, it’s stagnation. The refusal to compromise creates gridlock, frustrates citizens, and erodes faith in institutions. Practical problem solving, on the other hand, requires a willingness to engage constructively and respectfully. Leaders who can speak across divides without abandoning their convictions are rare, but they are indispensable to restoring civility and functionality in public life.
As this session begins, both the House and Senate must rediscover that spirit of respect and reason. Politics will always involve disagreement, but disagreement need not become hostility. When legislators meet each other with humility instead of suspicion, they create space for genuine understanding, and ultimately, progress.
The stakes could not be higher. Beyond the fiscal challenges, Maryland’s broader well-being depends on our ability to govern through consensus rather than combat. A state that leads with cooperation can weather federal headwinds, attract investment, and inspire confidence in its people. A state that succumbs to perpetual division risks stagnation and decline.
We Marylanders may be in different boats, urban, suburban or rural, but we share the same pond. When those waters become turbulent, all of us are affected. The only way to steady them is together.
Compromise is not weakness. It is the highest form of political strength. It demands courage, empathy, and pragmatism, the very qualities that have carried Maryland through crises and define the best of our public service traditions. As the new legislative session begins, may our leaders remember that politics, at its best, remains the art of the possible, and that the possible begins when divisiveness ends.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_0510-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-10 00:58:04.466867

He became director and a professor at the University of Florida Hamilton School for Classical and Civic Education on Jan. 1.
This could be the final Supreme Court appointment Gov. Ron DeSantis makes before he leaves office in about a year. Since taking office in January 2019, he has overhauled the court’s jurisprudence, creating an institution willing to jettison even longstanding precedent on abortion and capital punishment in the interest of conservative ends. He was assisted by the age-related retirements of the court’s moderate-to-liberal block.

All six of the candidates are affiliated with the Federalist Society, as is the governor himself. The Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies is a conservative-libertarian organization that promotes an “originalist” or “textualist” approach to jurisprudence. In practice, that means members tend to oppose economic regulation, affirmative action, and marriage equality and to support states’ rights an expansive reading of presidential power.

Adam Tanenbaum has served in all three branches of state government. He is a judge on the First District Court of Appeal, the most important state court aside from the Supreme Court itself, as it adjudicates cases arising from state law and policy.
He’s worked as an adjunct professor at the Stetson University College of Law, served a four-month stint as general counsel for the Republican Party of Florida, as a public defender, as chief deputy solicitor general in the Florida Department of Legal Affairs, and as general counsel for the Florida House and Department of State before becoming judge in the First District.
Has has taught at the Florida State University and University of Florida colleges of law.
“I would bring a deep-seated, long-standing principled commitment to ‘original meaning’ as a judicial philosophy in the faithful adherence to constitutional and statutory text while deciding cases,” Tanenbaum wrote in his application. “I also would bring a non-expansive approach to deciding cases and would seek to limit adjudication of a case, as much as possible, to the facts that are in the record before the court.”
A 1996 Georgetown University Law Center graduate, Tanenbaum graduated from high school in Pinellas County. He attended UF for his undergraduate degree.
At UF and Georgetown, he was in the Federalist Society. At Georgetown he was in the Republican Law Students Association and served as president of the Jewish Law Students Association.
He is still a member of the Federalist Society.
The appeals judge applied for the Florida Supreme Court in 2022 and the JNC certified his name to the governor as a nominee. 
Tanenbaum was general counsel to the Florida House during Republican Richard Corcoran’s speakership, which ran from 2016 through 2018.
He said in his JNC application last month that he is most proud of his service as a public defender and as counsel to the Florida House, which he described as a “dream job.” Corcoran and his chief of staff comprised “one of the best clients I could have mainly because they really wanted to be bold, they really wanted to do bold things and they let me be creative and think of new solutions to problems using wit and legal argument to accomplish what they were trying to accomplish.”
Tanenbaum pointed to the significance of DeSantis’ Supreme Court picks.
“This is his 8th pick, presumably his last and it’s probably his capstone appointment to solidify what he’s accomplished in the last seven years in remaking the court. My reasons for applying though are the same as they were before. I’m answering the call from the governor for qualified applicants,” Tanenbaum said.
Tanenbaum was primary counsel in Corcoran’s lawsuit against the Florida Lottery over a vendor contract worth hundreds of millions of dollars that would have vastly increased the number of lottery machines above the number authorized by law. The Lottery ultimately settled the case. 
In another case, Tannenbaum represented the Rick Scott administration in defending the state’s refusal to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states — after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld marriage equality. The state lost.
As a judge, he heard Byrd v. Black Voters Matter Capacity Bldg. Inst. (2022 and 2025), a high-profile challenge to a redistricting plan that eliminated minority-access voting districts. The state ultimately prevailed.
In 2024, his income was $215,750, including payment from part-time soccer refereeing.
Tanenbaum’s net worth as of Dec. 31, 2024 was $1.34 million.

Gannam earned his bachelor’s at the University of North Florida and went on to graduate from the UF College of Law and mostly worked as an attorney in Jacksonville and Maitland before being appointed to serve on the Sixth District Court of Appeals in Lakeland, the post he now holds.
Gannam said his son’s cancer diagnosis in 2003 shaped the way he serves as a judge. He had, he said, “to make weighty decisions under pressure, decisions about his treatment and exposure to the world outside the hospital where his life was at stake. Careful consideration of all information and maintaining composure under duress were essential to making the right decisions and generating confidence in them.”
Gannam’s last job was at Liberty Counsel, which litigates on behalf of an “historically Christian and biblical” worldview, according to its webpage.
“It is no doubt clear from my application that much of my prior public service and legal advocacy has a distinctively Christian bent,” he said.
“My public interest litigation in constitutional religious liberty cases was personally rewarding because it integrated my faith and my passion for the rule of law, which are central aspects of my life and vocation. But my faith-based associations have never required or tempted me to advance legal positions that are not supported by the law.”
The first reference he listed on his application was Florida Supreme Court Justice Meredith Sasso. He told the JNC that he hopes to emulate Sasso, who held the judgeship he now holds.
Other references include Republican state Sen. Clay Yarborough and Republican state Rep. and Speaker-designate Sam Garrison, and Joshua Mize, another candidate for the Supreme Court this round. Another reference is Jeff Aaron, legal counsel to Hope Florida Foundation during its scandal and who has worked closely with the DeSantis administration in legal actions. 
Gannam has been a Federalist Society member since 2020.
From 2014-2023, he provided pro bono representation to individuals and organizations in “public interest, religious liberty litigation.”
In 2015, he wrote a column in the Florida Times-Union titled, “LGBT people in Jacksonville do not need a Human Rights Ordinance.” That column declared, “Wherever LGBT ‘rights’ laws are passed, discrimination against people of faith follows.”
“A large majority of Duval County believes in the historical definition of marriage — unchanged worldwide for millennia — the union of a man and a woman. But anyone who dares express this traditional belief in a consensual conversation with a coworker or customer is guilty if  ‘discrimination’ is perceived by someone overhearing it.”
He represented members of the military in a class action challenging COVID-19 vaccine mandates during the pandemic. Those cases were eventually dismissed as moot when the vaccine policies were rescinded.
His net worth as of the end of 2024 was $205,715.
He made $206,504 in 2024 and was set to make about the same in 2025.

John Guard has worked in the Florida attorney general’s office since 2018 as senior counsel, chief deputy attorney general, acting attorney general, and chief deputy attorney general.
He took a brief hiatus from the AG’s office last fall while he awaited a nomination from President Donald Trump to the Middle District of Florida. Axios reported that nomination has been hung up because of his association with the Hope Florida scandal.
According to his application, in July he met with an investigator with the Second Circuit state attorney’s office “because I was a witness in connection to the transfer of $10 million to the Hope Florida Foundation from a settlement agreement with Centene Corporation.”
“My involvement in that settlement was limited to signing a settlement agreement after obtaining the Attorney General’s approval and a handful of emails. In October, the State Attorney contacted and told me that I was a witness in the matter, not a target, and that I had fully cooperated and provided truthful and complete information. I expect that investigation to be completed shortly.”
Law 360 reported Wednesday that Guard’s federal court nomination was not renewed for the new congressional session. Guard told the JNC that his preference is to serve on the Florida Supreme Court. 
His top references were U.S. Sen. and former Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody, followed by Tampa Republican U.S. Rep. Laurel Lee and Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier.
Guard graduated from Tulane University School of Law in 2000. He earned his bachelor’s degree from Florida State University in 1993.
He was assistant U.S. attorney in the Middle District of Florida, Jacksonville Division, from 2009-2012, working on fraud, narcotics, unlawful firearms, and violent crime. He spent two stints at Holland & Knight in Tampa. 
Guard has been in the Federalist Society since 2023. He is a committee member for the Tampa Bay-area Boy Scouts council. 
Guard said he hopes to emulate the late Justice Antonin Scalia. 
“I was recently reading an article where it said his name was invoked in Supreme Court arguments more than any other name, and that’s because of his courage, and because of his intellect and because of how willing he was to stand on his principles,” Guard told the commission. 
If he has any disagreements with Scalia, it would be on his interpretation of the First Amendment. Guard said he disagreed with Scalia’s ruling in Texas v. Johnson, in which the justice protected the burning of the American Flag. “He often was siding with the more liberal justices of the Supreme Court when it came to the First Amendment,” Guard said.
He’s represented the state in several-high profile cases, including the case against Purdue Pharma alleging damages from opioid use in the state. That ended with a $680 million settlement with Walgreen in 2022. He led negotiations for cities and counties receiving that settlement money and for a separate $26 billion settlement with other major pharmaceutical companies. In all, according to his application, the state will receive $3.15 billion from opioid settlements.
He represented the state in a suit filed by Planned Parenthood challenging the state’s 15-week abortion ban and in litigation between the state and Juul, alleging the company marketed vaping equipment to children. Juul settled for $79 million. The Florida Supreme Court upheld the state’s 15-week abortion ban.
Guard’s income in 2024 was $197,371 and his net worth as of November was $1.55 million.

Samuel J. Salario Jr. graduated from the University of Florida College of Law (1995) and holds a bachelor’s degree from The American University (1992).
In 2018 and 2019, he submitted applications to the Florida Supreme Court Judicial Nominating Commission. The JNC certified him for a nomination in 2018. 
“I regard the rule of law as possibly the greatest gift ever bestowed upon a political community. Liberty, human dignity, and economic prosperity are nurtured and shielded when the rules that govern us are rational, procedurally regular, and neutrally applied. This demands a judiciary that is respectful of decisions that are committed to the political branches of government, resolves disputes on legal principles openly explained and defended, and that is prepared to correct its own errors,” he wrote in his application. 
Most recently, he has worked as an attorney, but spent 2015-2020 as a Rick Scott appointee to the Second District Court of Appeal of Florida. Now, he’s a shareholder at Lawson Huck Gonzalez. Former Justice Alan Lawson and Paul C. Huck, shareholders at that firm, were his first references in his application to the court.  
“My most important potential contributions are the characteristics I hope I developed a reputation for as a Second District judge and that I have tried to promote in my current role, both in the cases I work on and the amicus briefs I do pro bono: an unwavering commitment to the rule of law, discipline and diligence in decision making, and respect for the people the courts serve,” he wrote. 
He spent two years as underwriting manager for a litigation finance firm from 2020-2022 and, earlier, spent 13 years at Carlton Fields in Tampa, mostly as a shareholder. 
His current practice involves “handling state and federal appeals across a broad range of subjects, including government and political disputes, criminal prosecutions, business disputes, class actions, estates and trusts, and amicus briefing in matters of interest,” he wrote in his application.
At UF, he was a member of the Federalist Society. In his professional career, he joined in 2015 and has been a member since. 
Among the nominees, Salario has the only notable presence on X.
In July, he replied to a post asking what late night talk show hosts Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, and Stephen Colbert have in common. “Low T.” he replied.
In September, in advance of the federal government shutdown, he replied to a video from Trump’s account that criticized U.S. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries.
A screenshot from Salario’s X account.
“Dear President Trump: The country desperately needs a Hakeem Jeffries sombrero meme with Mexican Radio by Wall of Voodoo as the operative music. Thank you for your attention to this matter,” Salario wrote.
In another, he posted a photo in response to an article about former President Joe Biden’s sex life.
In 2024, he made $534,551. His net worth as of December was $5 million, the highest among the nominees. 
He wrote a brief for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America in litigation opposing Amendment 4, the proposed 2024 constitutional amendment to make legal access to abortion.

(Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Hundreds of people gathered at the Colorado Capitol in Denver on Friday night to protest the recent killing of a women by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis.
Renee Nicole Good died on Wednesday after an ICE agent shot her through her car window. Her death, as well as another shooting by federal agents in Portland on Thursday, prompted demonstrations across the country against ICE.
Federal officials have accused Good of attempting to run over an ICE agent ahead of the shooting, but local and national leaders dispute that claim based on videos of the incident.
Good was from Colorado Springs and was living in Minneapolis.

Activist Jeanette Vizguerra, who was recently released after a nine-month detention at an ICE facility in Aurora, addressed the crowd from the steps of the Capitol. Protestors spilled into Lincoln Street between 14th and Colfax avenues and onto the snowy lawn, prompting road closures in the nearby blocks.
“People are ready for a revolution. People are ready to stop ICE,” Vizguerra said, leading chants of “Free them all,” referring to detained immigrants, and encouraging people to protect one another as they continue protests.

The group marched from the Capitol down the 16th Street pedestrian mall towards Union Station. Protestors told Newsline that they thought Good’s death was “criminal” and it felt the federal government is “covering it up” with its insistence that the shooting was in self defense.
Gov. Jared Polis called for an investigation into the shooting in a statement this week.
“What took place in a Minneapolis neighborhood is deeply disturbing, and the loss of Renee Good is tragic. My thoughts are with Renee’s family, especially her young child, friends, and loved ones including those in Colorado,” he said. “The American people deserve answers about what happened.”
More protests and vigils are planned in Colorado for this weekend, including on Sunday at the ICE office in Centennial. The protests follow previous demonstrations in Colorado and across the county over the past year against the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts.

Loneliness and love,Anna Wolfe,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/09/disgraced-welfare-director-takes-stand/,"FILE - John Davis, former director of the Mississippi Department of Human Services, leaves the Thad Cochran United States Courthouse in Jackson, Miss., Thursday, Sept. 22, 2022. Mississippi's largest public corruption case, in which tens of millions of dollars earmarked for needy families was misspent, involves a number of sports figures with ties to the sta[...]","Since he was arrested nearly six years ago for diverting millions of federal welfare dollars away from the needy, former Mississippi Department of Human Services director John Davis took the witness stand for the first time Friday.
He is the fourth witness to testify in the trial of a man he said he loved, former WWE wrestler Ted “Teddy” DiBiase Jr., who received more than $3 million in welfare funds during Davis’ administration. The testimony was dominated by Davis’ text messages with DiBiase and others, displayed in the courtroom using a projector. 
“There is nothing you could ever do to make me not love you,” read one text from Davis to the wrestler.
The two men even came up with a catchphrase using a combination of their names, “#DaViase4Lyfe,” which they’d sometimes use at the end of their text messages. Like “Bennifer,” the prosecutor noted.
The story told through the texts is one of a bromance with a tragic end. Davis is awaiting federal sentencing for conspiracy and theft and in DiBiase’s trial for conspiracy, wire fraud, theft and money laundering, he could face decades if convicted on all 13 counts.

But after six hours of showing Davis text after text, the federal government hadn’t finished with him. And the defense hadn’t taken their turn to question Davis. What the court heard from Davis Friday is an incomplete account from Davis. He is scheduled to return to the stand Monday. 
Still, the prosecution did start to prod at one of the case’s main mysteries: Davis’ motive. 
Davis testified that his introduction to the DiBiase family was through the youngest brother, Brett DiBiase, then a Toshiba salesman who had also been a wrestler. They’d run into each other having lunch one day and Brett DiBiase’s relative, a lobbyist, introduced the men. The agency quickly hired Brett DiBiase and he and the director became “very, very close,” Davis said.
“Were you in love with him?” Assistant U.S. Attorney John Meynardie asked.
“I loved him but not ‘in love’ with him if you’re asking the way I think you’re asking,” Davis responded. “I had no sexual desire toward Brett, but I loved him a whole lot.”

Brett DiBiase soon introduced Davis to his brother and his father, Ted DiBiase Sr., another former WWE star who ran an evangelical Christian ministry called Heart of David. Davis exercised unilateral control over the spending of a roughly $1 billion state agency, and they all began working together.
Davis testified that his agency contracted with Heart of David to satisfy a faith-based initiative that then-Gov. Phil Bryant, Davis’ boss, wanted the agency to support.
Around this time, Davis had also begun pushing tens of millions of federal welfare dollars to two nonprofits – Mississippi Community Education Center and Family Resource Center – to run a nebulous statewide anti-poverty initiative called Families First for Mississippi. Meynardie asked if this was part of Republican Bryant’s directive to “privatize” the agency.

“The administration liked to call it consolidation because it sounds better,” Davis said. 
But after the nonprofits received the funding, Davis testified that he often dictated what they did with the money, including giving it to his wrestler friends.
After a while of employing Brett DiBiase, Davis said, “it became really difficult for me to sit on Brett, because he was so high-strung.” 
Brett DiBiase was in recovery from drug addiction when they met, Davis said, but he relapsed. Davis dropped Brett DiBiase as an employee of his agency and helped get him a job at one of the Families First nonprofits instead. The wrestler’s salary jumped from under $100,000 at the state to $250,000 at Mississippi Community Education Center. 
Davis also testified that he accompanied Brett DiBiase on a trip to New Orleans to visit DiBiase’s extramarital girlfriend and twice on runs to meet the wrestler’s drug dealer. The prosecution asked directly if Davis had sexual relations with the younger brother and Davis said he had not. When Brett DiBiase agreed to return to rehab, he went to a luxury treatment facility in Malibu, California, on the nonprofit’s dime.
Had the nonprofits attempted to cut off the spigot to Brett DiBiase, Davis testified he would have tried to talk to them to keep the payments flowing.
“The million dollar question: Why?” Meynardie asked.
This is when Davis explained that he had no spouse, no children and few friends – a hazard, he said, of working at the state agency – and that Brett DiBiase, “he was like, I was going to say a brother, but more like a child.”
Throughout 2017, Davis began turning his attention – and finances – to the older brother, Teddy DiBiase, who lavished Davis with words.
“I don’t have enough room nor adequate words to describe the amazingness that makes up the DNA of your very being,” DiBiase once texted the director in late 2017. “… I don’t know where you came from or what we did to deserve such an honor to do life with you.”
By 2018, they were attending workouts together and moved into a swanky new office with valet parking in downtown Jackson. Together, they cooked up idea after idea. A statewide self-help lecture program. A program for inner-city youth. A feeding program. Something called “Jesse gym.”
If DiBiase could take the concepts he created during his time with the welfare program and make them unique, the two men hoped they could go into business together and sell the product to other states.
“I set (sic) up at night dreaming shit. But remember for us dreams are reality cause with Gods help all things are possible,” Davis once texted DiBiase. The texts were heavy with talk of faith and prayer.
Davis testified that he planned to leave the agency at the end of 2018 and part of his efforts with DiBiase were so there would be something waiting for him in retirement. They even mused about purchasing a property – the “DaViase Farm.”
“You’re talking about generational security?” the prosecutor asked, and Davis confirmed.
The prosecution asked if Davis’ newfound ventures with Teddy DiBiase made his brother jealous. “Yes sir, there was always some tension there,” Davis said.
The discussions weren’t always about grand visions. Sometimes they were about more tangible desires. Davis testified that the day after Teddy DiBiase received a $1 million agreement in May of 2018, the wrestler bought a truck. “That truck looks good with you on it,” Davis texted.
“I LOOOOOOOOVE THIS THING,” DiBiase responded. “And I love you John Davis more.”
But all while Davis was ensuring Teddy DiBiase in text messages of future grant funding “that will provide you with a level of security that I promised you,” he at times sang a different tune with the nonprofit directors.
“It bothers me that I allowed these guys to gain access and it feels like they are using,” Davis texted the Families First nonprofit directors. He was referring to DiBiase and friends of the wrestler that Davis had also allowed to the welfare trough. 
In another text, Davis wrote, “It’s frustrating how these people think they are so talented they need big money and then don’t do anything.”
At one point, Davis said he surmised that the nonprofit directors were hesitant about cutting off funding for DiBiase’s friend, who was not performing under his contract, because they thought doing so would upset Davis. The director wanted to assure them he was on the side of accountability. 
“There are no sacred cows for me,” Davis texted.
“But there were two sacred cows, weren’t there?” Meynardie asked Davis Friday.
Davis replied: “There were.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/09172609/AP22276452381257.jpg,,,2026-01-09 22:56:43.686130

Bob Ferguson speaks to reporters during the annual legislative session preview in Olympia, Wash., on Jan. 9, 2026. (Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson likely violated state laws by allowing his former top adviser, Mike Webb, to travel with him on a state plane to the Tri-Cities last summer, the state Executive Ethics Board ruled Friday.
In a unanimous vote, the board concluded there was “reasonable cause” to believe Ferguson ran afoul of Washington’s ethics laws by using state resources for the private benefit of a non-state employee.
Ferguson provided “a special privilege” to Webb by allowing him to travel on the Washington State Patrol aircraft, wrote agency executive director Kate Reynolds in her recommendation to the board.
Under the statute, the board will hold a hearing at which the governor can contest the charges either in person or through written testimony. The board will then decide whether a violation occurred and a penalty or other enforcement action is required.
A spokesperson for the governor did not immediately respond for comment.
Ferguson told the ethics board investigators last year that use of state resources was “de minimis in nature” and not for private gain, and he asked for the matter to be dismissed.

The Executive Ethics Board received a complaint July 30, 2025 alleging that the governor violated provisions of the Ethics in Public Service Act by letting Webb travel with him to the Tri-Cities. The June 26 trip, which included official business and a political fundraiser, was first reported by Axios.
Webb, Ferguson’s longtime friend and closest political confidant, served as the governor’s chief strategy officer until resigning in March amid complaints that he fomented a hostile workplace. 
In a staff meeting in mid-July, Ferguson addressed the trip, apologized and called his decision to let Webb fly on the plane “pretty stupid.”
In a written response, Ferguson also told the board’s investigators that, “Allowing an individual to travel as a guest neither interfered with official duties nor provided that individual with any improper advantage derived from state office.” 
“The flight in question was not at capacity,” Ferguson wrote. “The individual’s presence did not displace any state employee. It did not create additional cost in terms of fuel, staffing, or time. The state incurred no financial burden or misuse of taxpayer resources.”
Webb told The Seattle Times last year he sat on a seat over the plane’s toilet.
The travel “imposed no cost, no operational burden, and no impact on state functions,” he added. “Incidental or negligible use that does not result in added expense or harm to the public interest does not rise to the level of an ethics violation.”
The Washington State Patrol told investigators that aircraft costs are calculated on a per-flight-hour basis. If multiple agencies are using the plane, the tab is divided evenly by the number of passengers, and each passenger, or their agency, is billed for their share.
For the June 26 trip, the aircraft was only used by the governor’s office, so the aircraft cost was billed per flight hour. The report did not list the actual charge.

Bingham is the chief financial officer of Bingham Ventures, “a family-operated development organization, where she supports their financial management and the company’s commitment to community-minded development,” according to a press release from the governor’s office.
State Rep. Wendy Horman, co-chair of budget committee, to resign from Idaho Legislature

Horman, an experienced and powerful state legislator who has served as one of the architects of the state budget, announced Dec. 19 that she would resign from the Idaho Legislature to accept a position with the federal government in Washington, D.C. Rep. Josh Tanner, R-Eagle, was named as her replacement as co-chair of the Legislature’s budget committee on Monday.
Bingham and her husband, Val, have four children and reside in Idaho Falls, according to the release.
“Bingham is an active member of the Idaho Falls community, staying engaged over the years by volunteering at her children’s schools and serving in leadership roles through parent-teacher organizations and neighborhood groups,” the release said.
In the press release, Bingham said she was honored to represent the eastern Idaho legislative district.
“I sincerely appreciate Representative Wendy Horman for her years of commitment to our state and look forward to building on her legacy of service,” she said in the release. “I am thankful for this incredible opportunity and am excited to get to work.”
Bingham will serve the remainder of Horman’s term, which ends Nov. 30, 2026. All 105 legislative seats are up for re-election for two-year terms this year.
When there is a vacancy in the Legislature, Idaho Code states that the political party of the lawmaker who vacated the position will submit a list of three names to the governor for consideration.
“Bonneville County Republicans submitted a list of names to Governor Little for appointment, consistent with Idaho law,” the press release said.

(Photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)Attorney General Alan Wilson announced Friday picking state Sen. Mike Reichenbach as his running mate, becoming the first of seven candidates for governor to complete his campaign ticket.
The pair will first campaign together at a meet-and-greet event Monday evening in Florence.
Reichenbach, 54, brings a business background to the ticket and diversity to the governor’s race, both as the field’s lone Black Republican and only person from the Pee Dee.
In picking Reichenbach, Wilson also chose someone with a compelling personal story who’s still relatively new to politics. The car dealership owner was first elected to the Senate in March 2022 to fill the unexpired term of the late Senate Finance Chairman Hugh Leatherman following his death at age 90.
Four years after Reichenbach successfully campaigned as a “political outsider” for the seat Leatherman held for 41 years, he’s still been in elected office less than any of the Republicans running for governor. Wilson has been the state’s chief prosecutor since 2010.
While his announcement is a first for the race, it’s been in the works for months.
Reichenbach told the SC Daily Gazette that Wilson approached him last summer about joining his ticket. He didn’t specify when, but that means it was early into Wilson’s own campaign, which he officially launched last June.
Reichenbach said he was honored but needed to think about it. He eventually decided his experiences, particularly as a business owner, could help South Carolinians.
He recounted his early days in business during the Great Recession.
“I know what it’s like to lay awake at night and be unsure if you could make payroll and to have to lay employees off and to have to struggle as a small business,” he said. “I fight for small businesses because I am one.”
The lieutenant governor’s job is considered part-time. The job duties are largely whatever the person in the governor’s office decides.
The role used to include presiding over the Senate and overseeing the Office on Aging. But those responsibilities were taken away by the constitutional change approved by voters in 2012 to take the post off the ballot as a separately elected office.
That change didn’t take effect until the 2018 governor’s race, when Gov. Henry McMaster’s running mate, Pam Evette, became the first lieutenant governor in state history to be elected as part of a joint ticket.
Eight years later, Evette is among the four other Republicans and two Democrats running for governor who have yet to publicly pick their choice for lieutenant governor. The primaries are still five months away.
Reichenbach, a father of two, said he hoped to use the job as a metaphorical megaphone to advocate for issues that are deeply personal for him.
That includes making adoptions easier and more affordable and helping youth in foster care avoid prison time.
Like Wilson, the adopted son of U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson, Reichenbach was adopted as a child. During an abortion debate in 2023, he offered the most heartfelt explanation for supporting the six-week ban that took effect later that year.
His mother was 14 in 1971 when she became pregnant by her 15-year-old boyfriend, he said on the Senate floor, adding he’s here because she put him up for adoption.
On Friday, Reichenbach said he wants to take care of all families, not just “the typical Norman Rockwall perfect family.”
“We do have a bond,” Reichenbach said of Wilson. “We both feel passionately that we need to work to make the family unit stronger, but we also need to have a special focus on those that have no or have a little voice — those 3,300 children in foster care, that was me at one point. That could have been him at one point.”
The other Republicans campaigning for the Governor’s Mansion are U.S. Reps. Nancy Mace of Charleston County and Ralph Norman of Rock Hill, and state Sen. Josh Kimbrell of Spartanburg County.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Amid stalled state negotiations over how to share the Colorado River’s dwindling water supply, the Bureau of Reclamation on Friday released a range of options that will serve as the foundation for how to manage the river’s largest reservoirs – Lake Mead and Lake Powell.
The highly anticipated 1,600-page document details five alternative proposals that will guide new water management rules to replace the current ones set to expire in August 2026. The proposals primarily focus on the operation of Lake Mead’s Hoover Dam and Lake Powell’s Glen Canyon Dam.
The seven states that share the river’s flows have been deadlocked for nearly two years over how to govern the waterway through the coming decades — even as water levels at Lake Mead and Lake Powell are forecasted to reach record lows after two straight years of disappointing snowpack across the West.
The alternatives include a compliance option that could be implementable in 2027 if states can’t reach a seven-state agreement on how to share the river’s water supply, however under that alternative Nevada, Arizona, and California would face water shortages up to 1.48 million acre-feet.
“The Department of the Interior is moving forward with this process to ensure environmental compliance is in place so operations can continue without interruption when the current guidelines expire,” Andrea Travnicek, the department’s assistant secretary for water and science, said in a news release Friday. “The river and the 40 million people who depend on it cannot wait. In the face of an ongoing severe drought, inaction is not an option.”
Any guidelines adopted for post-2026 Colorado River operations are likely to face an early test with forecasts anticipating low elevations at Lake Powell and Lake Mead in 2027. Lakes Powell and Mead are currently less than two-thirds full, while projections show the river’s inflow next year is likely to be 27% lower than normal.
Without a strong winter snow season, it’s possible Lake Powell’s levels could drop low enough to cease hydropower production by next October — a scenario that would also limit the department’s ability to send water downstream to Nevada, Arizona, and California.
Negotiations between federal officials and the seven western states that rely on the Colorado River have largely remained behind closed doors since 2023, but any new operating rules are required to go through a public environmental review process before a final decision can be made.
The proposals released Friday were part of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process, which includes a Draft Environmental Impact Statement analyzing the impacts of the proposals. 
Several river negotiators said they have not yet reviewed the lengthy document published late Friday, and could not give a detailed analysis of the proposals.
“We are reviewing the draft EIS, and we expect to be in a position to provide comments next week. We’d like to give a thorough review before we comment,” said Bronson Mack, a spokesperson for Nevada’s chief river negotiator and general manager of the Southern Nevada Water Authority John Entsminger.
Utah’s chief river negotiator Gene Shawcroft echoed those comments.
“The Authority will take the time necessary to fully evaluate the document before offering detailed comments,” Shawcroft said in a statement.
Shawcroft called the release of the draft environmental impact statement for post-2026 Colorado River operations “an important milestone in a complex and consequential process.”
“The Authority looks forward to carefully reviewing the draft and continuing to work with our Basin State partners, water users, Tribes, and the Bureau of Reclamation to help ensure future operations protect Utah water users, support the environment, and reflect Utah’s priorities,” he continued.
In an unusual move, the draft environmental impact statement did not identify which set of operating guidelines the federal government would prefer. A preferred alternative is typically included in environmental reviews. 
“Given the importance of a consensus-based approach to operations for the stability of the system, Reclamation has not yet identified a preferred alternative,” said Acting Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Scott Cameron in a statement Friday.
However, the draft environmental review does include a broad range of possible alternatives designed to enable states to continue working towards a seven-state consensus agreement on how to share the river’s shrinking water supply.
“Reclamation anticipates that when an agreement is reached, it will incorporate elements or variations of these five alternatives and will be fully analyzed in the Final EIS enabling the sustainable and effective management of the Colorado River,” Cameron said.
States’ last chance to share a final consensus-based plan will be mid-February 2026 in order to reach a final agreement in the summer,  with implementation of the new guidelines beginning in October 2026.
States along the Colorado River have been split into two camps for months over how to manage the river after 2026: Arizona, California, and Nevada in the Lower Basin; and Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming in the Upper Basin.
One of the biggest disagreements between the Upper and Lower Basin states is over which faction should have to cut back on their water use, and by how much.
Lower Basin states want all seven Colorado River states to share mandatory water cuts during dry years under the new guidelines. The Upper Basin, which is not subject to mandatory cuts under current guidelines, say they already use much less water than downstream states and should not face additional cuts.
The public comment period on the post-2026 alternatives runs from Jan. 16 to March 2. The federal agency will also host two virtual meetings to share more details on the draft, scheduled for Jan. 29 and Feb. 10.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/091925_S-Utah-Stock_03-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-09 20:12:10.409715

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)The head of the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration said the state won’t pay the lawyer hired by the corrections board to represent it in lawsuits against the governor.
Jim Hudson said in a letter Tuesday to the Department of Corrections that paying attorney Abtin Mehdizadegan $300,000 would violate state law and Arkansas’ constitution, saying that the board did not follow state procurement procedures.
The rejection is the latest setback for the Board of Corrections which has been embroiled in a legal fight for over two years with Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders over who controls the state’s prison system. Disputes over how and whether to pay Mehdizadegan has been part of litigation that’s spawned from that power struggle.
Hudson’s rationale for denying the payment is similar to arguments Attorney General Tim Griffin has made in court — the board did not follow state law when it hired the outside lawyer, his letter said.
“The Board is obligated to follow state procurement law just as any other agency governed by constitutional provisions are so obligated,” Hudson wrote, citing the state Game and Fish Commission and higher education institutions as examples. “DFA cannot pay invoices for services that were not lawfully procured.”
Mehdizadegan and a spokesperson for the Department of Corrections did not respond to a request for comment Friday.
The fight over control of the prison system began in 2023 when the panel fired Sanders’ pick for Corrections Secretary, Joe Profiri. When Profiri asserted that only Sanders could fire him due to changes in state law, the board — which is created by the constitution, not state law — hired Mehdizadegan and sued.
The board has argued that the changes Sanders signed into law violated Amendment 33 of the Arkansas Constitution by shifting oversight of the corrections system from it to the governor. A state judge last year agreed, finding those laws unconstitutional.
Mehdizadegan’s hire quickly became its own legal battle when Griffin sued over it, saying board members violated procurement  law and the Freedom of Information Act they hired Mehdizadegan.
Court rulings last year appeared to clear the way for the board to pay the attorney. 
In his letter this week, Hudson also wrote the Department of Corrections does not have funds appropriated to cover the bill. Under the state’s constitution, paying those invoices would require legislative approval. 
The denial came after multiple communications from board member Lee Watson — who, as an attorney himself, also acts as the board’s legal liaison — to Hudson in the weeks after a Dec. 16 meeting where the board voted a second time to pay Mehdizadegan, after department staff raised concerns that the state would not pay the invoices.
Hudson also wrote that the laws the board sued over were not factors in whether the bills could be paid.
The denial comes after Sanders appointed three new members of the board, a move that could give her greater influence over the panel with whom she’s sparred.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Hudson-10.17.25-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-09 19:58:42.625541

(Bob Wick photo/Bureau of Land Management)The state of Alaska is preparing to give away millions of dollars worth of gravel to public corporations, a move that would amount to millions of dollars in assistance to some of the state’s biggest construction projects.
According to a Q&A posted by the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, the beneficiaries could include the proposed Ambler Access Project and the proposed trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline.
The state’s plans were disclosed the day before Thanksgiving in a public notice stating that DNR is planning “regulation changes on material sales and conveyances to state agencies.”
The Department of Natural Resources oversees mining on state lands in Alaska, including the extraction of gravel and fill dirt for use in construction.
While humble, gravel can be serious business — in November, DNR commissioner-designee John Crowther signed an order that prohibits gold, silver and other kinds of mining near gravel quarries along the Dalton Highway, which links Fairbanks to Prudhoe Bay. 
For state maintenance crews that need to keep the highway open, gravel is more important than rare minerals.
In 2024, High Country News reported that for construction projects on the North Slope, gravel is a “precious commodity” because of its scarcity. 
One of DNR’s proposed changes to its gravel rules declares “that the department convey material to a state agency or public corporation at a base price of $0.00 per cubic yard and without retaining a reversionary interest.”
Currently posted price charts show the state selling gravel for $3 per cubic yard in Interior Alaska. 
State law prescribes that any time DNR wants to sell land or public resources for less than market value, the commissioner must declare that the sales “serve a public purpose and are in the public interest.”
The upcoming regulation change states that transfer to a state agency or state corporation is automatically consistent with that requirement.
That would allow the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities to get gravel from state land for free, excepting the cost of processing and transportation. 
In a question and answer notice published Dec. 26, DNR said the change is intended to allow “for maximum use of state land consistent with the public interest.”
“Examples of a public purpose would be a state agency or public corporation using gravel to construct a gravel pad on a state leased site for infrastructure development; to construct a new state highway right-of-way or expand an existing state right-of-way; or to build an embankment along a river; or gravel needed for the development of a gas line right-of-way,” it wrote.
The free gravel and dirt would also be available to state-owned corporations, which is likely to affect some of the state’s biggest development projects.
The Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority is developing a 211-mile road between the Dalton Highway and mine sites in northwest Alaska and would be eligible for the free rock and dirt. So would the Alaska Gasline Development Corp., which is now a junior partner in the development of the proposed trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline. 
A spokesperson for Glenfarne, the pipeline’s lead developer, said the firm did not request the regulation change.
In 2024, the Bureau of Land Management estimated that the proposed Ambler Road would need between 15 million and 22 million cubic yards of gravel, plus an additional 220,000 to 347,000 yards annually for maintenance.
If the state of Alaska provides that gravel for free, it would be a revenue loss of between $45 million and $66 million for construction alone. 
The public comment period on the change expired on Jan. 2, and it was not immediately clear when the change would take effect.
Lorraine Henry, director of communications for DNR, said by email that it isn’t yet clear how much gravel might be affected by the regulation change, and that the agency didn’t intend to benefit any specific project.
“DNR cannot speculate on the volume of gravel that may be involved, as each application from State of Alaska agencies will be evaluated on its merits – and will include a public process and follow statutory authorities,” she said.

Legislative Bill 938, the First-Time Homeowner Savings Account Act, was introduced Friday by State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse on behalf of State Treasurer Joey Spellerberg. Spellerberg took the reins of treasury in November after Tom Briese resigned.
Similar first-time homebuyer legislation was introduced last session by State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha. Spellerberg’s staff said it was not aware of the Cavanaugh bill when the treasurer was examining models tried in other states. Staff said LB 938 was not meant to be competing legislation, but a vehicle to address one of the largest challenges facing Nebraskans. 
While similar to Cavanaugh’s LB 151, the new proposal allows for higher savings amounts. Under LB 938, eligible individuals could contribute up to $5,000 a year and couples up to $10,000. Contributions would be deductible from adjusted gross income in Nebraska, and earnings from the savings account would be exempt from state income tax when used for homebuying expenses.

Total contributions would be capped at $50,000 for married couples and $25,000 for individuals. Impacts on the state budget would start in 2027, when the bill would go into effect.
Cavanaugh said he was “thrilled” to know others agree with the merits of the homeowner savings account and hopes it’s a sign the idea will advance this session.
Spellerberg, the 35-year-old former mayor of Fremont, said inflation and higher interest rates have made the dream of homeownership “harder than it should be, especially for young families and young professionals.”
Housing is consistently discussed as a top concern and impediment to growth, he said.
 “As the state’s chief financial officer, I believe LB 938 will help more Nebraskans own a home and do it in a financially responsible way.”

Juneau over the downtown area Jan. 9, 2026. City officials issued an evacuation advisory Friday morning. (Photo by Claire Stremple/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s capital city advised downtown residents in avalanche zones to evacuate their homes late Friday morning. Avalanche risk mounted as a result of increased snowfall, higher temperatures and forecasted rain, triggering an emergency alert. 
City and Borough of Juneau Emergency Programs Manager Ryan O’Shaughnessy said the city is monitoring the risk closely and working with the National Weather Service and the state’s Department of Transportation.
“If you live in a slide path it’s time to grab your go bag and get out of your house and make other arrangements until the hazard has cleared,” he said at a news conference on Zoom that began late Friday morning.
O’Shaughnessy pointed residents to an interactive map of avalanche zones in downtown Juneau. Residents can type in their addresses to see if they are in a risk zone. He said the avalanche zone depicted in the maps includes what are called runout zones, where snow would spread after an avalanche.

“This is not a decision that we made lightly,” O’Shaughnessy said of the evacuation advisory. “We’ve been monitoring the current conditions… and we’ve come to this decision to ultimately protect life and safety.”
The American Red Cross of Alaska has opened Centennial Hall as a shelter for displaced residents. O’Shaughnessy said the shelter will also accept people whose residences do not fall in the evacuation zone if they feel they are in danger. He said the evacuation notice could last several days depending on weather conditions.
Juneau has endured record breaking cold and snowfall this winter. NWS recorded 82 inches of snow at the Juneau airport in December and another 9 inches this month. The average for an entire winter season in Juneau is 87 inches of snow, NWS meteorologist Nicole Ferrin said.
NWS reported 3-7 inches of snow overnight on Thursday and a transition to moderate to heavy rain on Friday. Ferrin said the agency expects the heaviest rain on Friday afternoon and evening, which should taper on Saturday.
In addition to avalanche risk, there is a flood watch in effect in Juneau for localized flooding and ponding of water on roadways.

“If you’re not sure how deep the water is across a roadway or otherwise, or if you don’t know if your vehicle can make it through, then find an alternate route,” Ferrin said on Friday. “If your tailpipe is reaching the level of the water, then you could easily get stuck and cause more issues there.”
State transportation officials closed the only road to the Thane neighborhood at noon on Friday due to high avalanche risk in the Mt. Roberts slide zone. Capitol transit has limited bus service and is not servicing stops on Glacier Highway due to avalanche risk in that area.
The City and Borough of Juneau and the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska issued a joint disaster declaration on Tuesday that was followed by a verbal state disaster declaration from Gov. Mike Dunleavy.
The news comes less than two weeks before the beginning of the legislative session in Juneau. The Capitol Building is not in an avalanche zone, but the governor closed all executive offices on Friday afternoon, according to Sante Lesh, the director of the state’s Legislative Affairs Agency.
Jeff Turner, a spokesperson for the Dunleavy administration, said state buildings are in “good shape,” but employees were asked to go home early on Friday at 1:00 p.m.
U.S. Coast Guard Sector Southeast Alaska has crews on standby to support Capital City Fire/Rescue and provide waterside transport in the event that it is needed to bypass high risk areas on the road system, Coast Guard Captain Stanley Fields said on Friday at a news conference with the city.
Juneau schools are closed Friday in anticipation of heavy snow and rain; the University of Alaska Southeast is operating remotely.
“This is a tough one,” O’Shaughnessy said at the Friday news conference. “This storm has impacted every aspect of all of our lives, both personally and professionally. I think everyone is tired. I know I’ve shoveled roofs and my driveway more times than I can count. But I want to stress that we are not out of the woods, and there are still significant hazards that remain for the public.”

(Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado Opportunity Caucus said its bank statements offer “evidence for complete vindication” of allegations that Democratic state legislators broke the state’s law prohibiting elected officials from receiving gifts. 
Colorado Common Cause, a pro-democracy organization, filed complaints with the Colorado Independent Ethics Commission against members of the caucus alleging they accepted payment from a pro-business dark money group, One Main Street, for luxury resort expenses at an October gathering with lobbyists in Vail. The gathering was first reported by The Colorado Sun. 
Caucus leaders allegedly asked One Main Street to pay a $25,000 bill for legislators’ hotel expenses while at the Vail retreat. Email screenshots included in the complaints filed by Common Cause show One Main Street Executive Director Andrew Short asking for “an urgent, out-of-cycle approval for a $25,000 expenditure to secure hotel rooms for the Colorado Opportunity Caucus Summit.”

The complaints should be dismissed because the caucus had enough money on hand to cover all of its expenses from the Vail retreat before One Main Street made its donation, according to the response filed Thursday on behalf of Sen. Lindsey Daugherty of Arvada, who chairs the caucus. Daugherty said “the entire basis for the complaint is factually false” and encouraged Common Cause to dismiss the complaints. 
“The truth is that the Caucus could and did pay the hotel bill without using this (One Main Street) donation,” the response says. “In fact, the amount attributed to (One Main Street) as set forth in the complaint was donated to a local food bank and was never used for any Caucus purpose, let alone for the retreat. Therefore, because the causal link needed to prove an ethical violation is missing, this complaint must be dismissed.”
The response characterized the Vail trip as an “organization and educational retreat” for caucus members. 
Gift ban approved in 2006
Aly Belknap, executive director of Colorado Common Cause, said the responses fail to address the emails from One Main Street leadership that led to Common Cause filing the complaints. 
“Nothing the Opportunity Caucus put forward in their filing or their press statements change the underlying facts of the case,” Belknap said. “We continue to have full confidence in the substance of our ethics complaints and we know that the Independent Ethics Commission has taken a close look and says our ethics complaints have merit.”
Recht Kornfeld PC filed responses on behalf of 15 legislators who face allegations. Sen. Kyle Mullica of Thornton opted not to be represented by the law firm representing other legislators, according to a spokesperson for the caucus. 
Other accused legislators include Rep. Tisha Mauro of Pueblo, Rep. Michael Carter of Aurora, Rep. Jacque Phillips of Thornton, Rep. Rebekah Stewart of Lakewood, Rep. Meghan Lukens of Steamboat Springs, Rep. Karen McCormick of Longmont, Rep. Cecelia Espenoza of Denver, Rep. Matthew Martinez of Monte Vista, Rep. Katie Stewart of Durango, Rep. Sean Camacho of Denver, Sen. William Lindstedt of Broomfield, Sen. Marc Snyder of Manitou Springs, Sen. Dafna Michaelson Jenet of Commerce City and Sen. Judy Amabile of Boulder. 
A complaint filed against former Rep. Shannon Bird of Westminster was dismissed because she did not attend the retreat in question. 
The Independent Ethics Commission moved the complaints forward in its review process in November. 
Colorado voters in 2006 approved a gift ban for elected officials. 
“Transparency is the point of the work that we do, and ethics enforcement only works if it’s done in the light of day,” Belknap said. “We believe in the system that Colorado voters and lawmakers created when we passed Amendment 41 to establish this gift ban.” 
Commissioners will review the responses filed by the legislators at its Jan. 20 meeting, and an investigation into the allegations will follow, according to Dino Ioannides, executive director of the commission.

Oct. 15, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A legislative bill introduced Friday would make the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission an elected office. Another bill would protect physicians who want to recommend the medicine.
Both bills, from State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, come after a yearlong, continued fight to implement a medical cannabis system that voters approved in the 2024 general election. Voters legalized up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis with a health care practitioner’s recommendation.
Voters also created a regulatory, governor-appointed Medical Cannabis Commission with “exclusive” authority to regulate the drug. Under the law, three members of the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission automatically serve on the Medical Cannabis Commission.

Commissioners Robert “Bud” Synhorst of Lincoln and James Elworth of Nebraska City were appointed to the commission in November. Oct. 7, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Cavanaugh, a Democratic candidate for Congress in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District, said making the commission an elected office would instill direct accountability to voters who have “clearly expressed their desire to have a well-regulated, functioning medical cannabis system.”
That’s a desire Cavanaugh said Gov. Jim Pillen and his appointees have “definitely frustrated.”
“The voters deserve to have more input,” Cavanaugh said. “I think it’s clear the voters want this, and this is giving an opportunity to have a board that is directly accountable to the people and will be more reflective.”
Legislative Bill 934 would require the five commissioners to be elected statewide beginning in 2028 for four-year terms. District lines would follow those of the five-member Public Service Commission. Two commissioners would run again in 2030 so future terms would be staggered. 
The commission would continue to operate as-is through Jan. 4, 2029.
Cavanaugh also introduced LB 933 with State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln. It would protect health care practitioners who recommend medical cannabis to patients from any criminal, civil and disciplinary action solely for recommending the medicine. 
The Omaha senator made a similar last-minute attempt to pass protections in May 2025, which procedurally fell flat. A more comprehensive legislative framework for medical cannabis, from State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, also failed to advance.
Many Nebraskans have said their in-state physicians have been unwilling to issue recommendations. The commission is writing regulations that would allow legal in-state sales.
Said Cavanaugh: “I’m trying to eliminate the fear of retribution from people like the attorney general who are specifically taking action to have a chilling effect on professional judgment.”

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner) LINCOLN — A financial advisor who helped Lincoln businessman Aaron Marshbanks swindle $45 million from nearly 20 banks and savings and loans was ordered Friday to pay them more than $37 million in restitution.
While it’s doubtful that Jesse Hill, a Hickman financial advisor, will ever come close to paying off the financial institutions, the order gives a final rendering of how much money is still owed on fraudulent loans used to cover catastrophic investment losses and to purchase a villa in Costa Rica and a turboprop airplane.
This is what the Marshbanks mansion, now called “The Plainsman,” looked like in November as new owners began the work of completing the construction of the unfinished luxury home. (Screenshot from the Lancaster County Assessor’s Office website)
The scam, first reported by the Nebraska Examiner, has been described as possibly the largest case of bank fraud in Nebraska history.
Hill, officials have said, would accompany Marshbanks, a real estate investor, when making loan applications, providing falsified documents that showed plenty of collateral in investment accounts.
Hill was not present in the courtroom Friday when U.S. District Judge Susan Bazis issued her restitution order. He has already begun serving a five-year prison sentence.
Friday’s 10-minute hearing was in stark contrast to the October sentencing, when members of Hill’s evangelical church packed a large courtroom in the federal building in Lincoln in hopes that Hill would receive a more lenient prison sentence.
Only a handful of federal probation employees and FBI agents were present Friday when the restitution order was given. Hill’s wife, Tabitha, quietly watched the proceedings via a video connection.
The decision likely means that the Hill family’s luxury home and acreage near Hickman, valued at $1.2 million, will have to be sold to help satisfy the funds still owed to the victims after some assets were recovered.
News of the fraudulent loans became publicly known after Marshbanks, a former school board member and star athlete at Lincoln Christian High School, was found dead in his car in a downtown Lincoln parking garage in November 2022 after overdosing on several drugs.
Shortly after that, the Nebraska Department of Banking and Finance went to court to block Hill from selling more investments and to freeze certain assets.

Federal prosecutors have said that all told, Marshbanks and Hill obtained $45 million in fraudulent loans from financial institutions in Nebraska and Iowa, of which $37.14 million is still owed after some assets were sold.
This summer, Hill, then 35, agreed to accept a plea deal, admitting to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud in exchange for the dismissal of other federal charges.
At his sentencing hearing in October, Hill admitted that he didn’t “have the courage” to “challenge” Marshbanks as the scam continued.

Marshbanks, according to Hill, began to deteriorate, evolving from a devout family man to someone who spent more time away from home, working out, mixing pain relievers with protein shakes and seeking more and more loans to cover what investigators termed catastrophic investment losses in 2022.
Some of the ill-gotten bank loans were used by Marshbanks to finance construction of a luxury home and barndominium on an acreage he purchased on the eastern edge of Lincoln.
As for Hill, Friday’s restitution order means he will likely have to sell a $1.2 million acreage and 3,000-square-foot home where his family lived near Hickman. Also ordered to be sold were the villa in Costa Rica and a multi-million-dollar Pilatus turboprop airplane he and Marshbanks co-owned.
According a U.S. Department of Justice website, such restitution is rarely paid fully, in part because such repayment to victims of crime can total millions and because the person ordered to pay often has no funds or ability to pay.
Hill had been working construction jobs prior to beginning his prison sentence last month.
Judge Bazis ordered that once Hill pay, once released from prison, $100 a month, or 5% of his gross wages, to pay off the restitution order. At $1,200 a year, it would take him more than 30,000 years to fully pay the restitution.
On a separate legal track, a receiver is still searching for available assets owned by the Marshbanks estate to pay back the banks.
One remaining question is whether a life insurance policy, in excess of $3 million, will go to reimburse the financial institutions or to Marshbanks’ widow and children. A trial in that case is expected this year.
Here’s what each bank is owed via the restitution order, per the judge:

Access Bank, $1.6 million
Columbus Bank and Trust, $2.7 million
Charter West Bank, $2.4 millon
First Nebraska Bank, $3.2 million
 Home Federal Savings and Loan, $2.9 million
I3 Bank, $2.7 million
Lincoln Savings Bank, $2.8 million
Mid States Bank, $2.3 million
Nebraska Bank of Commerce, $674,000
Nebraskaland Bank, $2.7 million
Security National Bank, $3.2 million
State Nebraska Bank and Trust, $4.0 million
Western National Bank, $3.3 million
Western Nebraska Bank, $2.7 million

Beau Ballard of Lincoln and Margo Juarez of Omaha meet on the floor of the Nebraska Legislature. Jan. 9, 2026. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska lawmakers are set to consider a slew of nationally relevant topics in the 2026 legislative session, including new bills addressing immigration enforcement, homeless encampments and artificial intelligence.
More than 100 new bills were introduced Thursday and Friday. That brings the total number of new bills, resolutions and constitutional amendments introduced over the first three days of a shorter, 60-day session to 250. Legislation can be introduced through the 10th legislative day: Jan. 21.
Immigration enforcement

Legislative Bill 907 from State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha, would prohibit law enforcement officers from entering “community safe spaces” to enforce immigration law. Such spaces include a range of public properties, including hospitals, schools, libraries, churches, shelters and courthouses. 
Juarez said she brought the bill because she is “appalled” that the Trump administration has allowed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to go “everywhere.” She said she views it as a violation that impacts both the people ICE is targeting and other members of the public visiting the same spaces. 
“I don’t like the creation of that precedent,” Juarez said. 
Juarez also introduced LB 906, which would prohibit law enforcement officers from wearing facial coverings, masks or disguises and require them to wear identification. State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha brought a similar bill — LB 854. Juarez said she didn’t talk to Hunt about the issue beforehand.  
Juarez’s bill is a bit more expansive than Hunt’s. It specifies that any evidence collected by an officer in violation of the new law would be inadmissible in court. She said there are legitimate safety reasons for officers to wear face coverings but argued it shouldn’t become the norm. 
“Bank robbers cover their faces, not law enforcement,” Juarez said.
Homeless encampments

LB 925, from State Sen. Bob Andersen of Omaha, would outlaw unauthorized encampments on any public property or right-of-way, unless the land is designated as a campsite or temporary site for an unsanctioned homeless encampment. State law already prohibits unauthorized encampments on state and county property, Andersen said.
The “Safe Parks and Public Spaces Act” came about, Andersen said, because of some residential area encampments where residents had seen unlawful behavior, such as drug use. 
“It is threatening and makes it unsafe for the resident,” Andersen said.
Violations of the new law would be a Class V misdemeanor, but, for first-time offenders, law enforcement would direct them to the nearest appropriate shelter for homeless individuals. 
Political subdivisions would be prohibited from allowing anyone to regularly camp or sleep on such property or rights-of-way and could not prohibit or discourage enforcement. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services would oversee any alleged violations.
AI chatbots

LB 939, from State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil, would require age verification for chatbots on online platforms and require online platforms to identify when chatbots use artificial intelligence and prevent such chatbots from impersonating a human while interacting with a minor. 
Chatbots are often operated by artificial intelligence software and apps, including X’s Grok, Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Murman said some of these services have been linked to youth suicides, and he hopes to mitigate those risks by increasing transparency. 
“I don’t want to overly regulate AI at all,” Murman said. “AI has a bright future.” 
Murman said LB 939 is similar to a previous bill he passed in 2024, LB 1092, which required online porn companies to verify users’ ages. As a result of the law, Pornhub went dark in Nebraska, where it remains to this day. 
It is unclear how an executive order President Donald Trump signed in December seeking to stop states from regulating artificial intelligence might impact LB 939. The order does include a carveout for protecting minors.

Other legislation
Among other notable bills introduced this week: 

LB 837, by State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte — Allow cash transactions and wages in the state to be rounded up or down to the nearest nickel with the national elimination of pennies. Transactions ending in one, two, six or seven cents could be rounded down, while transactions ending in three, four, eight or nine to be rounded up. Digital payments, gift cards, checks and money orders would not be affected.
LB 843, by State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue — Require the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services to file a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program waiver for refugees and immigrants. 
LB 848, by State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, and LB 865, by State Sen. Jason Prokop of Lincoln — Create three-day sales tax holidays before the start of fall school semesters. Cavanaugh’s LB 848 would begin at 12:01 a.m. the first Friday of August for clothing, school supplies, computer software, graphing calculators and personal computers up to certain dollar amounts. Prokop’s LB 865 would begin at 12:01 a.m. the last Friday of July for child care supplies, clothing, footwear and school supplies up to certain dollar amounts. The state sales tax is 5.5 cents per $1, most local rates are up to 2 cents.
LB 849, also by Cavanaugh — Exempt over-the-counter drugs from sales taxes.
LB 881, by State Sen. Dunixi Guereca of Omaha — Require law enforcement agencies, jails and the Nebraska State Patrol to receive approval from a “local governing body” before entering agreements to enforce immigration law. This follows controversies over Nebraska entering an agreement with the federal government over transferring the McCook Work Ethic Camp to ICE and local decisions by county sheriffs and county jails to help ICE. 
LB 910, by State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering — Require individuals convicted of sexual offenses against children to pay a fee for electronic devices seized during prosecution. 
LB 913, also by Hardin — Requie DHHS to appoint a dementia services coordinator who would serve as a central point to collect data on Alzheimer’s and dementia, evaluate needs and link families caring for individuals facing those diagnoses with resources.
LB 915, by State Sen. Loren Lippincott of Central City — Allow one additional Inland Port Authority district, for a total of six. The five current ones are in Omaha, Bellevue, South Sioux City, Lincoln County and Fremont/Dodge County. Districts require approval from a host city or county and are intended to help spur economic development.
LB 940, by State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil — Prohibit certain artificial color additives in meals served at public K-12 schools. The banned additives would include Blue 1, Blue 2, Green 3, Red 40, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6.

The maternity ward at the Ouachita County Medical Center in Camden closed after hospital administrators concluded that keeping it open “was no longer feasible,” hospital CEO Glenda Harper said Friday afternoon. Harper said last year that the ward “does not make money at this point.”
The decision to close the ward exacerbates the challenges for patients and providers in a region where places to give birth were already scarce. Paramedics have seen an uptick in the number of deliveries being performed in ambulances.
Harper has been CEO of the hospital since August and hoped to keep the labor and delivery unit open despite it losing money every month, she said.
Arkansas’ maternity ward shortage sometimes leads to births in ambulances, paramedics say

However, the unit only delivered 119 babies last year, falling short of the goal of delivering 200 babies per year in order to justify keeping it open, Harper said. The hospital rarely exceeded 200 births per year since 2015, and it also struggled to retain obstetric nurses, she said.
The unit’s closure “reflects the immense challenge hospitals face when reimbursement rates from all payors do not keep pace with the rising costs of providing care,” the Arkansas Hospital Association said in a statement Friday.
The Ouachita County Medical Center closed its intensive care unit in late 2025 for similar reasons: low patient volume and difficulty staffing the department, Harper said.
The closest hospitals with labor and delivery units to Camden are in El Dorado, a roughly 40-minute drive, and Arkadelphia, roughly an hour’s drive.
Camden’s hospital is the seventh in Arkansas to close its labor and delivery unit since 2020. Among the other six is the hospital in Warren, an hour’s drive from Camden.
The closure leaves only 32 hospitals in 22 of Arkansas’ 75 counties with labor and delivery units.
Amanda Warren-Newton, president of the Arkansas Ambulance Association and owner of Columbia County Ambulance Service, said she’s “working to elevate the competency” of paramedics to care for patients and their babies before and after birth because of the shortage of delivery units, she said. Columbia County borders Ouachita County to the southwest.
Republican Sen. Matt Stone of Camden said Friday that the Ouachita County Medical Center’s closed obstetric unit is a symptom of the ongoing struggles facing maternal health providers, especially in rural areas.
“I think that’s going to cause other problems with infant mortality and taking care of mothers and everything else, but they’re just trying to keep the doors open,” Stone said.
Arkansas consistently has among the highest rates of maternal and infant mortality nationwide, according to the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement.
The Ouachita County Medical Center employed an obstetric physician who will be leaving the state now that the labor and delivery unit has closed, Harper said. She also said two obstetric nurses who worked in the closed unit have been transferred to the hospital’s emergency room.
“If obstetric patients present with urgent needs in the ER, there are people there who can take care of them,” Harper said. “What we’ll do is assess them, stabilize them, and then transfer if their condition warrants it, and if not, treat them and send them home, if it’s not obstetric needs. We will have the capability to monitor to see if they’re in labor and what the fetal heart rates are.”
Trading inpatient care for more federal money works for some, not all rural Arkansas hospitals

Most of the Camden hospital’s patients are admitted through its emergency room, Harper said. The hospital applied this week to become a rural emergency hospital, which would allow it to collect more federal funds in exchange for reducing or eliminating inpatient services and focus on emergency and outpatient treatment. It would be the sixth Arkansas hospital to assume this designation if the federal government approves the application.
Rural hospitals with 50 beds or fewer are eligible to apply for rural emergency hospital status. If accepted, they are subsequently licensed for zero inpatient beds.
Patients’ average stay at a rural emergency hospital over the course of a year must be no more than 24 hours, according to federal eligibility requirements. Delivering a baby via Cesarean section requires two or three days in a hospital for post-birth observation, so the Ouachita County Medical Center would have had to limit its obstetric services to low-risk patients only if the maternity ward had remained open, Harper said.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ambulance-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-09 19:12:53.961487

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)FRANKFORT — A naturalized citizen from Louisville decided to run for the state House the night before the filing deadline, spurred by a Kentucky lawmaker’s proposal to bar immigrant citizens from holding local and state elected offices.
Suhas Kulkarni, who immigrated to the U.S. from India in 1986, told reporters that the legislation was “the straw that broke the camel’s back” before filing his paperwork at the Kentucky secretary of state’s office Friday. 
Kulkarni’s daughter, Rep. Nima Kulkarni, also a naturalized citizen and an immigration lawyer, has represented Louisville’s 40th House District since 2019 and is seeking reelection this year. She and her mother joined the elder Kulkarni as he officially threw his hat into the ring.
“I said, ‘Something’s got to be done about this.’ And then we talked about it and we said that our family has had the actual experience of the American Dream,” he said, adding that his family “struggled really hard” to build up a business, has paid taxes, served with community groups and more. 
“At the end of the day, if somebody says to me that after all of this, you’re not eligible to have some of the rights that citizens have, I don’t agree with it,” Kulkarni said. “So, I said this is not the time for me to sit on the sidelines.” 
The bills Kulkarni referred to, House Bill 186 and House Bill 259, were filed by Rep. Shane Baker, R-Somerset, in the first week of this year’s General Assembly. Baker told Kentucky Public Radio that his goal is to prevent those who have naturalized citizenship or dual citizenship from taking the state in an unspecified “direction.” 
Suhas Kulkarni said his family came to the U.S. seeking help for his older son who had learning disabilities. His son eventually attended The de Paul School in Louisville. He added that “we jumped from the lunch rooms of executive offices where I was working (in India) to sweeping the floor in a neighborhood grocery store.” He later bought the store and expanded an export business with it. 
In the 1990s, Kulkarni started an information technology business which later gained federal government contracts. 
When he turned 60, he felt that “there’s got to be something more in life,” so he turned to public service. He joined former Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer’s administration and founded the Office for Globalization, which is now called the Office for Immigrant Affairs.
Kulkarni said that there are “so many more benefits being a cohesive community as opposed to being an exclusive community” and he wants the next generation to have those benefits. 
“This is America — the land of opportunity, the land of possibilities, the land where people can come when people can work hard, achieve what they can do,” he said. “The American Dream — it’s not all economic, it’s social, it’s the mingling of cultures, it’s the strengthening of the gene pool.”
The incumbent Republican in the 48th House District is Rep. Ken Fleming, who is seeking reelection. Another Democratic candidate, Nathan Bellows, filed to run in the district last month. The district includes parts of Jefferson County.
Democrats and Republicans gear up for 2026
Ahead of the 4 p.m. deadline, Kentucky candidates vying for offices across the state were whisked through the secretary of state’s office Friday to put the final signatures on their paperwork.

Secretary of State Michael Adams, a Republican, said his office had received 437 net new filings since the filing period opened in November, including candidates for state and federal office. 
Adams said this year’s deadline day was “pretty slow.” Looking over the list of candidates, he said he noticed a lot of Republican primaries in Northern Kentucky this time around and his office had also seen “a real uptick” in Democrats filing for the state House this week. 
“I’m guessing KDP (the Kentucky Democratic Party) really worked it, or the caucus really worked it to get people to file for a lot of these seats that had been unopposed previously,” Adams said. 
Ahead of the filing deadline, House Democratic leaders were hopeful of growing their caucus this election cycle. During a press conference Thursday morning, House Democratic Floor Leader Rep. Pamela Stevenson, of Louisville, said Democrats would have more contested races outside of Lexington and Louisville this year.
“You will see more contested races,” she said. “We will grow this caucus, and we will make sure that what stays at the center of who we are are the people.” 
KDP spokesperson Nat Turner told the Lantern in a statement Friday that the party was “thrilled to have more than 700 Democrats running for local offices all over Kentucky and nearly 100 running for seats in the General Assembly.”
“This excitement is a testament to the energy we are building around our common goal of reinforcing the American Dream, so Kentuckians in every county have good-paying jobs, access to quality health care and education and the opportunity to build a better life for their families,” she said. 
On the GOP side, Republicans remained confident that they will maintain their caucus numbers in the legislature. At present, Republicans have 80 seats to the Democrats’ 20 in the House, and 32 seats to the Democrats’ 6 in the Senate. 
In a press release after the deadline, Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, highlighted that eight members of his caucus are seeking reelection unopposed. 
“This is more than just a political milestone. It is a strong vote of confidence from Kentuckians in the direction our commonwealth is heading,” Stivers said. “That level of confidence reflects the strength of the conservative, responsible policies the Senate majority has championed for the past decade, which have delivered results and earned the trust of Kentuckians.” 
Sen. Max Wise, the Republican floor leader in the Senate, told reporters Friday morning that the caucus had been “very aggressive in fundraising to make sure that we’ve got our resources available for members who may have challenging opponents.” 
“We look forward to any challenges that come our way,” he said. We feel very strong with our supermajority of who we’ve got to be there to protect them, to hold their seats when it comes either May or November.” 
Who’s filed?
In the legislature, all seats in the Kentucky House of Representatives will be on the ballot, as well as about a third of Senate seats. Some lawmakers have announced they will not seek reelection in 2026, paving the way for candidates to run for a few open seats, while some incumbents will be challenged. More than 50 general elections in the legislature will be contested, according to filings as of Friday afternoon. 
In Louisville, three Democrats are challenging Democratic state Rep. Danield Grossberg. They are Jefferson County Public Schools teacher Cassie Lyles, former JCPS teacher and political adviser Max Morley and Mitra Subedi, who narrowly lost the 2024 primary to Grossberg by 50 votes before allegations of inappropriate behavior towards women last year against Grossberg were made public. Grossberg faced no opposing candidate in the 2024 general election. 
Democratic Rep. Adam Moore of the 45th House District in central Kentucky, is being challenged by a former Republican lawmaker, Killian Timoney, who was defeated in the 2024 primary. Moore won the election later that fall. Both had filed their election paperwork ahead of Friday. Jeffrey D. Thompson, a Republican, filed Wednesday. 
In the 93rd House District, Democratic Rep. Adrielle Camuel is being challenged by Hannah Rivera, a Republican who filed a whistleblower lawsuit against the Kentucky Community and Technical College System in 2024. Rivera had worked at KCTCS in several capacities over a decade, including as chief of staff. The lawsuit is still pending in Franklin Circuit Court, according to court records. 
Those that aren’t seeking reelection include Republicans Rep. Ryan Dotson of the 73rd House District, Rep. David Hale of the 74th House District, Sen. Jimmy Higdon of the 14th Senate District and Democratic Rep. Ashley Tackett Laferty of the 95th House District. Dotson is running in the GOP primary for the 6th Congressional District. 
Laferty is the last remaining Eastern Kentucky Democrat in the House at present. The race for her seat will be contested, as two Republicans, Willie Crase Jr. and Tanner Hesterberg, and a Democrat, former state Sen. Johnny Ray Turner, have filed for the seat. 
In judicial races, Kentucky Supreme Court Justice Chief Debra Lambert is up for reelection, and has filed to run again for the state’s high court. She faces no opponent. Lambert, who became Kentucky’s first female chief justice in 2025, represents the 3rd Judicial District, which includes parts of Central and Southeastern Kentucky. 
A seat on the Kentucky Court of Appeals is open after Supreme Court Justice Pamela Goodwine won election to the high court in 2024. The seat covers the 5th Appellate District in Central Kentucky. Those who have filed to run for the seat are Fayette County Circuit Judge Lucy Ferguson Van Meter and Judge Will Moynahan, who was appointed to fill Goodwine’s vacancy on the appellate court by Gov. Andy Beshear. 
Twelve Republicans and seven Democrats have filed to run for the seat currently held by longtime Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell who announced last year that he would not seek reelection.
Kentucky’s six congressional seats are also on the ballot, and all incumbent U.S. representatives have filed for reelection with the exception of Republican Andy Barr, who is running for the open Senate seat.

Scams are costing the state’s event venues tens of thousands of dollars.

Picture this. You love the Indigo Girls. Imagine your excitement, then, when you discover they’re playing at your favorite local venue, The Flynn, in Burlington. You click the first link and go to purchase tickets, only to discover an exorbitant $250 price tag. You love the Indigo Girls, but you also need to pay your mortgage, so you pass. 
Then, you notice the website looks suspicious. It’s not The Flynn you’re buying from. It was a scam.
“Ladies and gentleman, that woman was me,” Susan Evans McClure, executive director of the Vermont Arts Council, told the House Commerce and Economic Development Committee Friday. “I realized that if I, the director of the Vermont Arts Council, didn’t realize I was being faked by a fake website, who else was being harmed by this?” 
McClure was there to testify on H.512, a bill that seeks to enhance consumer protections against predatory and scam ticket resellers. 
Though lawmakers still need to hash out the details of the legislation, it appears to have broad bipartisan support for some of its possible concepts, like a 10% cap on resell ticket markups, banning deceptive URLs and preventing sites from selling tickets that don’t yet exist. 
These practices that the bill would aim to guard against, though perhaps outlandish sounding, are already pervasive in Vermont, according to McClure and others. She pointed to the cost of tickets for UVM men’s soccer’s final game last season, which a reseller had posted online for almost 20-times face value. 
Kevin Sweeney, director of marketing and sales at The Flynn, told the committee his team has identified more than 50 websites reselling tickets from Vermont events, 20 of which have only cropped up in the last year. 
Scammers aren’t just costing consumers; they’re costing venues, according to Sweeney. Eventgoers frequently show up to The Flynn with tickets that were sold to multiple people by fraudulent vendors, he said. To preserve customer sentiment, The Flynn refunds the tickets, according to Sweeney, and he estimated that the fraud refunds and staff time cost the business about $50,000 annually. 
“We don’t have 50,000 to spend on that. That’s a full-time person we could bring in to do programming we really want to do,” he said. 
The bill currently exists only in short form, which means legislative attorneys need to work out the nitty-gritty. But the Vermont Attorney General’s Office endorsed the broad intent of the legislation Friday, and the committee looks poised to take it up in the weeks to come. 
In the meantime, be careful out there.

In the know
Senate Republicans declared their commitment to affordability and public safety at a press conference Friday, plus their concerns for Vermont’s dwindling revenue for roads and transportation.
It raises an interesting conundrum — how Republicans will juggle declining tax revenue, Vermonters’ desire for affordability and increasing needs in areas like infrastructure.
“We’re pretty firm: no new taxes, no new fees,” Senate Minority Leader Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, said. “But I think we also can’t be so bullheaded to say that we’re not willing to consider tax reform.”

Nearly our national bird
“The wild turkey has a special place in my heart as everybody knows,” Rep. Chris Pritchard, R-Pawlet, told the Vermont House Environment Committee while talking about the success of wild turkey restoration in West Pawlet. He said the birds were now in every town in the state of Vermont “for everybody to enjoy.”

Shrine and dine

A shrine appeared Friday memorializing the Capitol cafeteria’s lost microwave. Or Michael Wave, as one missive labeled the machine.
Flowers, a heartfelt ode, some amateur graphic design — the gravesite could move even the most cynical lobbyist to tears. If not tears of sadness, at least tears borne of hunger.
I do take issue with the microwave being labeled “comrade.” Inquisitive minds recognize the machine as a tool of capitalist ghouls, whose obsession with productivity has turned the midday meal into something to be scarfed down under expedited duress.

The two previously planned to place competing initiatives before voters, each stipulating that the one that got the most “yes” votes would win. OpenAI’s proposal largely reflected existing law, while the Common Sense measure included new bans on what AI systems children could access.
The merged measure is known as the Parents & Kids Safe AI Act. It would, among other things:

Require chatbot developers use technology to estimate a user’s age range and apply filters and protective settings for  people with an age predicted under the age of 18
Require AI systems to undergo independent audits to identify child safety risks and report them to the California attorney general
Ban child-targeted advertising and the sale or sharing of kids’ data without a parent’s consent
Stop manipulation through emotional dependency by preventing AI systems from promoting isolation from family or friends, simulating romantic relationships with kids, or claiming that they’re sentient

 A Common Sense spokesperson said the measure was filed Thursday afternoon. It’s not yet visible on the attorney general’s website but you can read a copy obtained by CalMatters here. As described in a press release, the combined measure drops a ban on student smartphones in K-12 California schools and prohibition on minors using chatbots capable of engaging in erotic or sexually explicit talk that were part of Common Sense Media’s original initiative. 
The initiative must receive 546,651 signatures in order to come before voters in November. California Secretary of State Shirley Weber has until June 25 to determine if it reaches that threshold or qualifies for the ballot.
Common Sense put forward its original ballot initiative, the California Kids AI Safety Act, last fall, not long after the Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill the nonprofit had authored that contained similar provisions.
In response, in December 2025, OpenAI put forward a competing ballot measure that mirrors a bill that Newsom signed into law last October, requiring companion chatbot providers to enact a suicidal ideation protocol and inform people every three hours that they’re speaking with AI. Critics called that move manipulative and designed to thwart stronger protections for kids.
Common Sense Media research has found that seven in 10 teens have used companion chatbots and that the tech is too dangerous to be used by minors. In promoting its original ballot initiative, the group warned that without action the tech could lead to more harm and addiction for young people. In one well-publicized case, the parents of California teen Adam Raine sued OpenAI, alleging Raine was coached by OpenAI’s ChatGPT to commit suicide.
OpenAI’s willingness to compromise marks a contrast with how tech companies banded together to get their way in a policy fight in 2020. That year, major gig economy players like DoorDash, Instacart, Lyft, and Uber spent $200 million bankrolling a successful ballot initiative regulating gig work, Proposition 22. It effectively exempted them from a state law that would have required the companies to provide full employment benefits to their drivers.
Sen. Steve Padilla, the Chula Vista Democrat who carried the chatbot bill signed by Newsom, called the merged ballot measure a significant breakthrough. But he added that he thinks the matter should be handled by lawmakers and the governor instead of directly by voters. Since the ballot initiative would amend the state constitution, Padilla said it “would create an unnecessarily high-bar to revise and update that law in the future. Moreover, legislative hearings will provide the broader public an opportunity to comment and provide input on this important issue.” 
In recent weeks, Padilla has proposed a bill that requires age verification for chatbot use and a four-year moratorium on the sale of toys with companion chatbots inside. OpenAI signed a partnership with Barbie-maker Mattel but has yet to produce any products.
OpenAI’s fight at the California ballot box isn’t limited to kids’ online safety issues. One proposed ballot initiative would give a state commission the power to slow or stop AI model development if commission members suspect catastrophic risk of harm to Californians. Two other proposals target corporate conversions from nonprofit to for-profit companies, as OpenAI has planned. The initiatives compel nonprofits that restructure in such a way to dedicate all their assets to the public benefit of humanity. To reach that goal, the initiatives would create a commission that has the power to shut down AI models and that hosts competitions that invite the public to propose ways AI can help humanity. Under one of the initiatives, the commission would also have the power to revoke nonprofit conversions.
OpenAI was founded about a decade ago with a charter stating its purpose was to benefit humanity. Its plans to convert to a public benefit corporation led to heavy criticism from nonprofits and scrutiny by attorneys general in California and Delaware. Both states eventually reached agreements with OpenAI to allow a restructuring after the company agreed to place roughly 25% of its assets into a nonprofit.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/032123-Open-AI-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-09 18:58:20.155862

(Photo by Otto Kitsinger/Idaho Capital Sun)A federal judge on Thursday lifted a years-long ban on Idaho’s law that prevents transgender people from amending their gender on their birth certificate. 
The state had been blocked from enforcing the policy since a 2018 federal court order found that it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

The order was in response to Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador’s request made in October to remove the block, citing a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that limited such broad-reaching bans. 
“For years, Idaho was blocked from enforcing common-sense policy and law requiring birth certificates to reflect biological sex recorded at birth,” Labrador said in a press release Friday. “Birth certificates aren’t symbolic documents that are subject to how an individual may feel, they’re legal records used in medicine, public health research, and identification. Idaho can now enforce our law protecting accurate vital records, while treating all Idahoans equally under the same amendment process.”
The nation’s high court ruled that federal judges can, in most cases, only place injunctions on laws that affect the plaintiffs in the case. In a court agreement filed Dec. 5, 2025, both sides of the case agreed that one of the transgender plaintiffs had already received their amended birth certificate and the other had chosen to remove themselves from the case. 
The lawsuit was filed in 2017 by attorneys from Lambda Legal on behalf of a transgender Idahoan woman and was later amended to add another trans woman from Idaho as plaintiff against officials from the Department of Health and Welfare and Bureau of Vital Records and Health Statistics. 
Peter Renn, senior counsel at Lambda Legal and one of the plaintiffs’ attorneys, told the Idaho Capital Sun in an email Friday that the change was in response to the Supreme Courts’ prior decision and “the fact that the original case wasn’t filed as a class action,” which a type of lawsuit brought on behalf an entire group of similarly situated people.  
“But nothing prevents a new case from being filed, and what hasn’t changed is that forcing transgender people to present birth certificates and driver’s licenses that out themselves as transgender when navigating everyday life is dangerous, archaic, and still very much unconstitutional,” Renn wrote. 
 “We anticipate that Lambda Legal may hear from Idahoans who are harmed by this development, especially because we understand that people born in Idaho may no longer be able to update the gender on their Idaho driver’s licenses to match their gender identity without access to birth certificates that reflect who they are.”

 Idaho previously had to pay over $300,000 over 2020 law that violated court order 

Despite the 2018 federal order that prohibited the state from automatically rejecting applications from transgender individuals to change the sex listed on their birth certificate, the Idaho Legislature in 2020 passed a law that limited ways birth certificates could be amended and prevented transgender individuals from changing their document. 
Later that year, a federal magistrate court again barred the state from automatically rejecting transgender Idahoans’ applications, and the court ordered the health agency to “institute a meaningful and constitutionally-sound process for accepting, reviewing, and considering applications from transgender individuals to amend the gender listed on their birth certificates,” Idaho Public Television reported.  
The court ordered that the state pay the transgender Idahoans who sued more than $300,000 for legal fees. 
Under Idaho’s law, to amend a birth certificate within one year of its issuance, Idahoans must provide a notarized affidavit declaring information was incorrectly recorded. After a year, corrections require a court action showing “fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact.”

The New Mexico Department of Justice said in a letter Jan. 9, 2026, that the commission’s decision to extend an ICE contract was “likely improper and invalid.” (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)The Torrance County Commission’s abrupt extension of an expired contract last month between the county, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and private prison operator CoreCivic is “likely improper and invalid,” according to a letter the state Department of Justice sent to county officials Friday. 
On Dec. 30, the three-person Torrance County Commission convened for a “special meeting” to extend an inter-governmental service agreement that enables ICE to house immigrant detainees at the Torrance County Detention Facility in Estancia. Before commissioners met, the contract had been defunct for two months.
The contract extension to March 31 of this year increased the monthly payment ICE makes to the county to roughly $2.4 million, funding the county then passes on to CoreCivic. The parties also backdated the contract to Nov. 1, 2025, the date the original contract expired.
NM DOJ says it is looking into Torrance County ICE detention contract extension

Immigrant legal advocates who have long called for ICE to cease housing detainees at the facility quickly raised questions about the validity of the contract extension and also whether the commission should have provided more notice to the public about the meeting between Christmas and New Year’s Day. 
The contract extension also got the attention of the New Mexico Department of Justice. Spokesperson Chelsea Pitvorec told Source New Mexico earlier this week that the meeting “raises real concern regarding backdating a contract, compliance with the New Mexico procurement code, and whether the Open Meetings Act was complied with.”
On Friday, the NMDOJ alerted county officials via a letter that based on additional investigation the department conducted, the county likely violated the Open Meetings Act by failing to provide proper public notice. One instance the letter cites is that the county placed an advertisement about the meeting in local newspaper Mountainair Dispatch one day before the meeting instead of the required 72 hours. 
50 NM immigrant detainees say mail issues at jail hurting their legal cases  

The letter also raises questions about whether the county could legally backdate a contract, noting that retroactive acts like that typically only occur when a public body is correcting an error. 
“The apparent retroactive extension of the County’s [agreement] with ICE is likely improper and invalid,” writes Blaine N. Moffatt, director of the NMDOJ’s Government Counsel and Accountability Bureau. 
The letter, addressed to County Commission Chair Ryan Schwebach, asks the county to respond in a week with answers about how it publicly advertised the meeting and justified backdating the contract. 
County Commission Chair Ryan Schwebach told Source New Mexico on Friday in a brief phone interview that the county did not violate the Open Meetings Act. He said the Torrance County attorney was already at work on a letter in response to the NMDOJ. 
“There is not a potential violation of the Open Meetings Act,” Schwebach said. “We do not violate the Open Meetings Act,” he said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_3533-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-09 18:58:20.155862

In a statement, Chouteau County also aired some objections it had raised in the case and outlined the way the settlement could play out.
The county said the approved settlement notes if the U.S. Supreme Court decides only the U.S. Department of Justice can bring a lawsuit under the disputed section of the Voting Rights Act, the settlement is vacated.
In the case, the Chippewa Cree Indians of the Rocky Boy’s Reservation and two Native American voters had alleged the county’s at-large voting system unlawfully diluted the voting strength of Native voters, and last month, the U.S. District Court of Montana approved the settlement.
The case centered on a section of the Voting Rights Act, Section 2, which prohibits any “standard, practice, or procedure” that “results in a denial or abridgment of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.”
A violation of Section 2 occurs if a political process leading to an election is not equally open to participation by a minority in a jurisdiction, or the minority group has less opportunity to elect a representative of their choice than other voters.
Chouteau County sought to dismiss the case, but the judge ordered mediation.
The settlement means the Chippewa Cree Indians of the Rocky Boy’s Reservation has a chance to elect a representative of their choosing to the Chouteau County Board of Commissioners. It ensures the reservation is part of just one district in the county, and it provides for an election in the “single-member district,” where only district residents vote for their representative.
At the time of the settlement, County Attorney Stephen Gannon said Chouteau County was willing to work with the tribe and had done so in the past, especially to ensure voters were properly registered, for example.
Released this month, an additional statement from Chouteau County outlines how the case unfolded, offered criticisms of the tribe, and described how the elections would work going forward as a result of the settlement.
Approved Dec. 15, the settlement changed District 1 in the county to consist of only two precincts, and it makes District 1 a single-member district. The settlement said that means in the 2026 election, “anyone in Commissioner District 1, including a member of the Chippewa Cree Tribe,” could run for office.
“As many Chouteau County residents know, members of the Chippewa Cree Indians of the Rocky Boy’s Reservation do not pay taxes that fund Chouteau County’s government,” the statement said.
The Rocky Boy’s Indian Reservation is 100% federal trust land, according to data from the Office of Public Instruction cited by the Montana Budget and Policy Center. Trust land is generally exempt from local property taxes.
Chouteau County Commissioners were unavailable for additional information in time for this story, according to legal counsel.
In response to the statement from Chouteau County, Chippewa Cree Indians of the Rocky Boy’s Reservation said some claims require “clarification,” and noted “voting rights are not conditioned on property ownership or tax status.”
Chouteau County, though, argued that “despite not paying taxes, tribal members receive services from Chouteau County; however, Chippewa Cree Indians of the Rocky Boy’s Reservation does not allow Chouteau County to provide services within the boundaries of the reservation.”
For example, the county said the tribe “refuses to share 911 information so the county can map addresses of its members.”
But issues related to taxation, emergency services or jurisdiction are “raised as a distraction,” the tribe said in a response provided by the Native American Rights Fund: “They were not the basis of the court’s decision and are unrelated to the right to fair representation.”
“The county is not allowed to silence the voices of any group of voters,” the tribe said. “That is what this settlement is about.”
Chairman Harlan Baker said equal rights was the point of the lawsuit.
“This case was always about equal access to the ballot and fair representation,” Baker said in a statement. “The settlement ensures that Native and non-Native voters alike have a meaningful voice in local government.”
Chouteau County said it settled despite some disagreement to avoid paying “potentially hundreds of thousands in fees.” In the settlement, each side paid its own fees.
The primary election for the new single member Commissioner District 1 will be June 2, 2026, same as the statewide primary, and the general election is scheduled for Nov. 3, 2026. Candidates may file from Feb. 17 through March 4.
In its statement, Chouteau County also talked about what happens if boundaries change in the future. It said the reservation currently overlaps Chouteau and Hill counties, and if the boundaries are modified so the reservation is located solely in Hill County, the settlement dissolves.
Also, in 2030, commissioner districts in Chouteau County will be reapportioned according to the census, Chouteau County said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-3521-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-09 18:58:20.155862

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)A protest of approximately 20 people outside of a federal immigration detention center Friday afternoon on Albuquerque’s south side sparked several physical confrontations, resulted in the detention of two protestors and ended after federal officials threatened the crowd with arrest if they didn’t disperse.
Dare to Struggle New Mexico organized the protest outside of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in response to the fatal shooting by an ICE officer in Minnesota of 37-year-old Renee Good.
“We’re here to let them know we’re here, we’re angry, that we want to block and get crazy for them,” said one organizer Lizzie Nutig said through a megaphone in front of the gates. “We need to be loud, we need to be brave, we need to be doing things to block them.”
She continued. “We need them to know that people are mad.”
Using a megaphone, Nutig and organizer Brian McQuaid led chants including “Be like Renee and Get in the way;” “Fuera ICE;” “Smash the mass deportation machine;” along several others that contained profanities.
About five minutes into the protest, several demonstrators approached the gates outside of the facility and hung photos of the immigration agent who shot Good, and a photo of President Donald Trump with a hand-printed expletive. 
DHS officials, who had been watching the protests from the office, exited the building and shoved protestors away from the fence, and told them they were required stay on the sidewalk to protest. Officers also detained one person who Source NM has not yet been able to identify.
Additional agents wearing camouflage and Enforcement and Removal Operations patches filed outside, carrying non-lethal firearms and Saber Red pepper spray. No members of DHS identified themselves when asked by protestors or the news media. 
Protestors yelled, sometimes using expletives: “Do you like hurting people?” “Get out of here,” and “go to h-ll.”
Agents rushed at one of the protesters who yelled profanities, Adeo Herrick and, as protestors attempted to intervene, one of the agents in fatigues fired pepper spray hitting himself and at least one protester.
Herrick was then dragged to the ground and provided their name to Source NM while being carried away by multiple agents into the building. 
Shortly after 12:40 p.m., a car emblazoned with the Federal Protective Service pulled forward, blasting the loudspeaker message: “This is deemed an unlawful assembly,” ordering the protestors and media to disperse or face arrest.
When reached by phone after the protest, Nutig and McQuaid said they had not yet heard if charges were being filed against the two protestors detained and said they were in contact with attorneys. In a statement, they requested the release of the two detained protestors and the “arrest of the officers who assaulted protestors today.”
A request for comment to the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement remains pending. 
Gov Michelle Lujan Grisham earlier in the day released a statement calling for a “thorough and transparent investigation,” into Good’s death.
The governor’s statement also expressed her support for “those raising their voice in protest. Protest is fundamental to democracy — it’s how we make our government listen when something goes terribly wrong. But protests must remain peaceful.”
The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding Friday’s protest.

Property rights issues center on the use of eminent domain for a proposed carbon sequestration pipeline. Demands to improve water quality take a couple of different approaches, including appropriated funding for a nitrate monitoring network and various land management strategies. This will the the third year that a bill related to pesticide labeling has appeared in the Iowa Statehouse.

Eminent domain and property rights
Debate around eminent domain and a proposed carbon sequestration pipeline have filled the halls of the Iowa State Capitol for the past four years and dominated the final days of the 2025 session, when lawmakers passed a bill restricting carbon sequestration pipelines’ abilities to build in certain areas.

The bill was ultimately vetoed by Gov. Kim Reynolds. Landowners and lawmakers, however, are already preparing for renewed policy and debate over the issue. 
Iowa Corn Growers Association noted in its 2026 legislative priorities that it will back “all efforts to lower (the) carbon intensity score of corn-based ethanol and promote ethanol as a carbon reduction solution across all markets while maintaining property rights.” 
The association, along with renewable fuel groups, have been supportive of the proposed Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline, which would transport carbon dioxide from ethanol plants to an underground storage site and give the ethanol and corn industry access to low-carbon fuel markets. 
Leading up to session, Senate Majority Leader Mike Klimesh, R-Spillville, has said he plans to introduce legislation that would allow pipeline companies to route around landowners without the use of eminent domain.
Pesticide labeling 
Past bills, supported by the manufacturer of the common pesticide Roundup, would have ruled that pesticide labels issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency would be sufficient in satisfying a requirement to warn users of the product’s health and safety. 
Opponents argue these bills would give pesticide companies, like Bayer and beyond, immunity from lawsuits where users claim the product gave them cancer. 
A bill passed the Senate in the 2025 session, but was not picked up in the House. 
Iowa Corn Growers Association supported the bill in 2025 and said in its 2026 policy guide that it supports “regulating pesticide residues in consumer products in finished goods, not by restricting pesticide use as labeled during production.” 
Iowans told lawmakers to “do your job” at a rally organized by Food and Water Watch on Feb. 10, 2025 in the Iowa Capitol Rotunda. They were opposing a Senate bill relating to pesticide companies. (Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch).
The association’s president, Mark Mueller, said in a news release that policy priorities are shaped by policy surveys and roundtable discussions with members. 
“The issues outlined in this year’s priorities reflect issues that matter most to Iowa’s corn farmers, and with the start of the legislative session next week, we are excited to fight for these issues on behalf of Iowa’s corn growers,” Mueller said. 
A policy update from Iowa Soybean Association said the ag group anticipates a bill that will “provide consistency and clarity on pesticide labeling” and provide “consistent” labeling from state to state. 
Environmental groups opposed the bill in past sessions, alleging such protections to pesticide companies stripped Iowans of their right to sue pesticide companies for causing illnesses.
The EPA holds that glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, is unlikely to be a carcinogen, but opponents of the bill argue otherwise. The scientific journal that originally published a key study on the safety of the chemical, recently retracted the study, citing concerns around authorship and the validity of the research findings. 
Food & Water Watch, in its “blueprint” for clean water in Iowa, said the Legislature must “resist and oppose all efforts to protect corporate pesticide manufacturers through language granting pesticides immunity from liability.” 
Water quality 
Improving water quality in Iowa has been a priority for environmental groups in Iowa for years, but things like a lawn watering ban and a water quality report in central Iowa in 2025 elevated the issue for lawmakers and other groups. 
Notably, several groups have called on the Legislature to restore funding, at $600,000 annually to the Iowa Water Quality Information System, or IWQIS, which gives real-time measures of pH, nitrate, dissolved oxygen, and temperature in streams across the state. 
The network has been supported by the Walton Family Foundation since the Legislature diverted funds for the network in 2023, but the funding is set to run out this summer. 
Iowa Environmental Council listed restoration of state funding for the program as a 2026 priority. 
“A clear picture of how water moves through Iowa’s waterways — along with where pollution comes from and how water quality is changing — is essential for developing effective, evidence based solutions that protect our health and ecosystems,” the council said in its legislative priorities.
The group is also asking the Legislature to protect water quality by prohibiting the discharge of coal ash leachate, a byproduct of burning coal, into waterways. 
Food & Water Watch, a non-profit environmental group, called for the restoration of funding for the water monitoring system in its long list of priorities for clean water in Iowa. 
The group pointed to nitrate as the “primary pollutant of concern” in Iowa waterways. Food & Water Watch asked for an end to large animal feeding operations in “vulnerable” groundwater areas, tighter language around manure lagoons and manure application procedures and requirements that producers submit manure management plans to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and other policy recommendations.
“Iowa’s current policies fail to keep the public informed or to address pollution before it reaches people’s drinking water,” the blueprint reads. 
Iowa Corn Growers Association also noted conservation and water quality as top priorities for 2026. 
The association asked the Legislature to maintain funding for the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy — a state-led program to assess and reduce nutrient runoff into Iowa waters and the Mississippi River. The strategy promotes practices like cover crops, fine-tuned fertilizer application and reduced tillage, but it does not mandate nutrient reductions. 
Other priorities: 
Lawmakers have highlighted that lowering Iowa property taxes will be a key goal of the 2026 session and Iowa farm groups noted property tax policies were also a priority this year. 
Ag groups also spoke in favor of a comprehensive agriculture bill, not yet filed but proposed, by Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig. The bill includes provisions for tax relief, expanded economic opportunities and enhanced biosecurity policies. 
Last year lawmakers considered several bills restricting food ingredients, including banning margarine from school lunches. Iowa Soybean Association noted that it would continue to advocate for the health attributes and safety of soy-based foods in the wake of similar bills.
Iowa Environmental Council additionally called on the Legislature to invest in programs and resources to reduce the prevalence of radon exposure in Iowa residences. Radon is a naturally occurring gas that has been linked to lung cancer. 
Lawmakers are scheduled to begin the 2026 legislative session on Jan. 12.

State officials gave a warning to United Counseling Service this December: Fix your longstanding problems, or risk losing your current ability to operate.
The state’s problem with the nonprofit provider’s service lines for people with developmental and intellectual disabilities include safety concerns that “put clients and staff at risk of harm” — things like failure to comply with housing inspections, high staff turnover and inadequate staff training and skills — according to the Vermont Department of Disabilities, Aging and Independent Living.
Now the Bennington-based agency must follow a corrective action plan and submit evidence to the department by March 2, to confirm that it has addressed the concerns. During this time, the agency is on a probationary status and unable to take new admissions of people seeking its services for intellectual disabilities.
United Counseling Service is one of the state’s 14 designated agencies — private, nonprofit organizations that the Department of Disabilities, Aging and Independent Living and the Vermont Department of Mental Health co-operatively contract with in each county to provide mental health care and human services, like care for those with intellectual disabilities and substance use disorders.
United Counseling Service sees 150 people with developmental disabilities. That includes medical care; different staffed, supervised, and group living arrangements; and transportation supports, among other services.
A key feature of the United Counseling Service’s support for those with developmental disabilities are the agency’s residential programs. The agency owns and operates three group living homes, with support professionals and a house manager in each residence full-time. The agency also facilitates “staffed living” for those with higher levels of need to receive more direct support in apartment-style residences, and it also coordinates shared living agreements for individuals to live in community members’ homes. Currently, the Bennington agency contracts with 28 shared living homes — 22 of which have been fully inspected and approved, the agency’s Director of Community Relations and Development, Heidi French, told VTDigger.
Care for six current clients is likely to be moved to another agency, she added, due to the safety concerns raised by the Department of Disabilities, Aging and Independent Living.
Separately, the agency also provides mental health services and substance use treatment. The mental health and substance use service lines remain unaffected by concerns from the Department of Disabilities, Aging and Independent Living, which specifically address care for those with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
To maintain designated status, an agency must meet criteria set and reviewed by the department. According to those at the department, United Counseling Service is not meeting the mark, and it hasn’t for quite some time.
In 2024, United Counseling Service’s status was knocked down to a provisional designation (“provisional designation without intent to de-designate”). Last month, it knocked that provisional status down one-degree further, to “provisional designation with intent to de-designate” (emphasis added).
If the agency loses its designation, it will no longer be able to receive state and federal funds from Medicaid for the care it provides those with intellectual disabilities, and the state would need to designate a different organization as the replacement. The department has 90 days following United Counseling Service’s March 2 submission of evidence to decide whether to begin the de-designation process. 
Other designated agencies have reached this point in the past, explained Vermont House Human Services Committee Chair Rep. Theresa Wood, D-Waterbury, who was briefed on the issue. In those cases, the agency at issue has worked across the network of fellow agencies through Vermont Care Partners to share resources and regain full designation status. 
“It’s unfortunate because [United Counseling Service is] an organization that historically has been very strong. Sometimes this happens when you have a lot of turnover in key leadership, and they have had quite a bit of turnover in leadership positions,” Wood said.
In its more specific role in regulating residential facilities, the Department of Disabilities, Aging and Independent Living has also mandated that the agency bring its shared living homes in line with safety requirements earlier than the March 2 deadline or risk having the department withhold administrative costs for the homes that remain noncompliant.
“We have been and are continuing to do everything we can to ensure we come into compliance. This shift in designation indicates there’s a continued need to do that critical work in order to get back to full designation status,” French wrote in an email to VTDigger. 
She said that United Counseling Service is working on additional training and staff oversight and ensuring its shared living homes are inspected and compliant with safety standards.

Following up on a promise from earlier this week, the Republican-led Michigan House of Representatives has filed a lawsuit against 31 state governments departments and their heads in an effort to bar them from accessing $645 million in work project spending. 
In December, Republican members of the Michigan House Appropriations Committee voted along party lines to disapprove more than half a billion dollars of work projects funds, drawing criticism from Democratic lawmakers and multiple Republicans.
Following a request from Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing), Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, determined that the maneuver used to cut the funds process violated the separation of powers clause and other requirements in the Michigan Constitution.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
While Democrats cheered Nessel’s determination, with Anthony calling it “a lifeline for the countless non-profit organizations and local governments that have been left in limbo for weeks,” Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) and House Appropriations Committee Chair Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township) were quick to criticize Nessel’s opinion as partisan and flawed. 
“Our lawsuit will stop this Nessel power-trip and uphold the law that allows the Legislature to put an end to this nonsense,” Hall said in a statement Friday. 
The suit, filed with the Michigan Court of Claims seeks immediate injunctive relief and a temporary restraining order to bar Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration from utilizing the funding.

After five years of planning, the new software system is off to a rocky start. (Photo illustration/Rhode Island Department of Administration image)Some unionized state employees say the state’s new payroll system is not functioning properly and has led to error-ridden paychecks for multiple pay periods. 
Statements released Thursday from three different unions representing state employees hint at ongoing issues with the rollout of the shiny, modern and long-awaited system — including missing wages, incorrect pay, and problems with overtime, benefits, and deductions. 
The legacy payroll system went away for good in early December, its aging architecture swapped out for a new system anchored in the cloud-based software Workday. The payroll upgrade is but one aspect of the state’s Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) endeavor, which began implementation in 2023 and wrapped up last year, consolidating and modernizing the state’s payroll, human resources and other internal IT infrastructure. 
While Workday does not handle support or configuration for the state system — that’s the responsibility of a separate state vendor — the unions have directed some of their ire at the software.
Rhode Island Council 94, which represents about 4,500 state workers and claims to be the state’s largest public sector union, released a statement that said missing or incomplete pay, mistakes in holiday pay or overtime, and deductions not hitting investment accounts were among the numerous complaints received from members.
“Workday is not working,” Council 94 President Michael McDonald wrote.
Council 94 Executive Director Alexis Santoro said the state has worked to correct some complaints, but then the union receives more each day.
The Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers said in a separate statement that labor orgs representing “thousands” of public employees have heard member complaints for three consecutive pay periods. Like Council 94, the correctional officers’ union cited missing pay, underpayments, unpaid overtime and incorrect deductions.
“Correctional officers are doing one of the most dangerous jobs in state government,” Brotherhood President Richard Ferruccio said. “Violence is up, staffing is strained, and mandatory overtime is routine. Asking officers to shoulder those risks and then failing to pay them correctly, especially after three consecutive pay periods and right before the holidays, is completely unacceptable.”
Yet another statement came from SEIU Local 580, which represents frontline employees across eight state agencies. The same paycheck-related laments from other unions are contained in the SEIU news release, with the union’s President Matthew Gunnip claiming one documented case concerns “a member with nearly three decades of state service who is undergoing cancer treatment is now facing leave without pay because required documentation was not processed during the ERP transition.”
“When pay problems happen once, that’s a mistake,” Gunnip wrote. “When they happen repeatedly, that’s a breakdown. At this point, the risk and stress are being absorbed entirely by workers.”
“I’ve been in regular communication with the local unions representing state workers and they are very frustrated by the continued problems with state payroll,” Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO and one of the state’s top labor leaders said over email Friday. “We are ready to work with the administration to address the ongoing concerns so the problems are addressed.”
Workers’ frustrations have coalesced into demands for a formal hearing before the General Assembly’s oversight committees. Council 94’s McDonald said in his statement that the legislature’s oversight committees need to “start scrutinizing” and “facilitate an independent review of what went wrong” with the payroll rollout.

“Oversight is absolutely needed!” Rep. Julie Casimiro, a North Kingstown Democrat who serves as first vice chair on the House Committee on Oversight, said via text message Friday.
“How dare the state mess up at this time of year…or any time of year … on such a sensitive issue,” Casimiro wrote. “Some employees live paycheck to paycheck and may need to make a choice between heat or food…Will there be any accountability on this with the state employees overseeing this? We need answers … and our state employees need answers!”
The Department of Administration was responsible for the ERP rollout, and spokesperson Karen Greco said via email Friday that the state anticipated “adjustments” during the multi-year process to upgrade a system which she said covers more than 15,000 employees on payroll.
“The State is currently tracking about 1,700 open payroll-related tickets; we have closed almost 1,900 payroll-related tickets since the first checks were disbursed in early December,” Greco wrote, noting that some employees may have more than one ticket.
Greco said the state is prioritizing anyone who may have been underpaid, and “has made progress each week” by “issuing frequent off-cycle payments as issues get resolved to quickly provide any funds owed to employees.”
The department has cut off-cycle checks on six separate instances over the last month, Greco said.
An unsigned statement shared Friday by Workday noted that “modernizing decades of operations onto a single, unified platform is inherently complex — moving data and workflows from dozens of disconnected legacy systems, including manual and paper-based processes, into one modern system of record.” 
Workday said it was “working closely with the State and its deployment partner to support this transition, and are fully focused on ensuring accurate and timely pay.”
Workday, however, is just the bedrock of software on which the payroll rests, and is not the state vendor responsible for configuring the software. The state’s website and project materials note that Accenture — a global consulting and professional services firm with offices worldwide, including one in Boston — is the implementation partner for its new enterprise infrastructure.
Accenture did not respond to multiple requests for comment Friday.
Payroll wasn’t built in a day
Like any ERP project of considerable scale, Rhode Island’s modernization for its enterprise software was not a singular task, and strategic planning began as far back as 2019.

State purchasing documents for a 2024 solicitation related to the software planning noted that, at the time, “nearly all” of the Department of Administration’s internal processing was still manual in nature, with timesheets submitted in hard copy or as PDFs. 
The old system also ran on a mainframe and was based on the programming language COBOL, first released 66 years ago but revised many times over. Though practically ancient by coding standards, COBOL retains great utility and reliability in the colossal systems used by governments, banks and big businesses. According to IBM, it still powers 80% of  in-person credit card sales and 95% of ATM transactions. Still, many organizations are now migrating away from COBOL as its most veteran practitioners retire.
Hundreds of state workers still await merit raises. McKee’s cabinet heads don’t face the same delay.

During a March 2025 hearing at the State House, DOA Director Jonathan Womer outlined the herculean efforts the ERP entailed, even in tiny Rhode Island, with his department “going through 50-plus collective bargaining agreements and rules and regulations around payroll, primarily for employees.”
Womer also noted the importance of the project then: “We don’t have enough modern controls over our finances and financial transactions. We have been relying on typewriters and carbon papers for a long time.”
The state’s ERP website, which has been live since at least May 2024 per the “last updated” timestamps, includes numerous links, phone numbers, and information relating for state employees on the project.
The website noted that the changes would come in two phases: Certain internal finance operations would go live on July 1, 2025, while “human capital management” and payroll would come later in fall 2025.
The site also hosts a blog attributed to a mascot called Big Red, a Rhode Island Red chicken sporting blue-framed sunglasses that explains the ERP in lay terms across his blog posts.

“Currently, our HR, Payroll and Finance systems are lacking,” Big Red explains in one post. “We have siloed, outdated (downright archaic) systems, processes and tools that involve the use of paper forms and typewriters, minimal interaction between systems, and a gazillion custom reports all because we’ve got … siloed, outdated (did I mention they’re archaic) systems… well, you get the point.” 
In a post from August 2025, Big Red promised the state was “taking additional steps to guarantee system functionality for everyone.” 
“Remember when I said more testing – that includes enhanced payroll testing,” the post notes. “Money, money, moneyyy! We are running multiple parallel payroll tests to triple check the math.”
The chicken’s enthusiasm is not quite echoed in general discourse about ERP transitions, which are often regarded as intensive and high-risk projects.
A 2020 report from 18F, a digital services team working under the U.S. General Services Administration, warned that big governmental software projects have a low success rate, with only 13% of projects priced over $6 million seeing satisfactory completion on time and within budget. Success rates for projects under $1 million soared much higher to 57%.
“It’s counterintuitive, but spending more money on a project increases the chances of failure,” the report noted.
In 2025, Rhode Island’s enterprise planning project was priced at around $91.2 million.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-09 22:57:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"After ICE protest, Hartford police launch investigation",Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/09/hartford-police-investigate-ice-pepper-spray/,Hartford police are investigating the hit-and-run and pepper spraying of people near a protest of ICE's actions in the Renee Good death.,"As elected officials and activists tried to make sense of Thursday evening’s events, in which one person was struck by a vehicle and at least half a dozen were pepper sprayed near a peaceful protest, they encouraged Connecticut residents to continue to show up to voice dissent. But they urged caution when confronting federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.
Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam on Friday morning told reporters that the events of the previous night were being investigated by the local police and the Department of Homeland Security. As hundreds gathered in front of a federal building in Hartford Thursday night in a peaceful vigil spurred by the killing of Renee Good by an ICE officer in Minnesota, some protesters moved to the opposite side of the building where the confrontation occurred. 
“We will be investigating what appears to be a hit-and-run incident by the what we believe to be a federal employee, as we would any other hit-and-run in the city of Hartford,” Arulampalam said. The Hartford police will also be investigating the use of pepper spray as an assault, and the incident of an object being thrown at a vehicle as property destruction.
Asked if the people driving the vehicles involved in the altercation were ICE agents, he said that “it’s a strong suspicion.”
ICE did not respond to a request for information about the incident.
Protests during the second Trump administration have remained largely peaceful in Connecticut over the past year, as crowds, sometimes numbering in the thousands, took to the streets with handmade signs to hear speeches and exercise their First Amendment right to voice dissent. 
On Thursday, a few people with megaphones ran toward those gathered at the vigil. The sound of speeches was temporarily interrupted by urgent cries to come to the other side of the building.
Even as volunteers at the official event urged people not to leave the vigil, dozens went, some under the impression that they were attempting to stop a detainee from being taken away by ICE in vehicles that were leaving the building’s parking lot on the other side of the building. They gathered in the street. In the confrontation, a woman was pushed down by a vehicle, which rapidly reversed. Another person threw an object at a van, breaking a window. At least half a dozen people were sprayed with pepper spray by a man wearing a mask.
With the identities of the drivers of the vehicles and the person who deployed the pepper spray unknown, Arulampalam said the incidents are being treated as unsolved crimes.
He said DHS has indicated that they’re conducting an internal investigation. 
“They’re refusing to share any details with us until that completes itself,” he said. 
Arulampalam was one of several elected officials to offer a tempered reaction to Thursday’s events: he criticized the role of the Trump administration in escalating violence while warning Connecticut residents not to play into the caricature of violent protesters in American cities that’s being used to justify events like the killing of Good.
Arulampalam said that the violence that occurred on Thursday night “is a direct result of the lawlessness and recklessness of the Trump administration that has occurred over the past year and that last night came here to the city of Hartford, that resulted earlier this week in the death of Renee Good in Minneapolis. That chaos that we saw last night didn’t come from the city of Hartford.”
Arulampalam expressed pessimism that the federal government would be cooperating with local officials on the investigation, and said the lack of cooperation “stymies the efforts of local law enforcement,” to solve the case.
John Cappadona came to the vigil on Thursday evening and said he watched a man hurl expletives at police officers.
“In high school you would have said he’s picking a fight,” Cappadona said.
Cappadona was impressed by Hartford police, who impassively waited until the man walked away, and by peacekeepers who tried to keep people calm. He said he would encourage anyone put off by reports of pepper spray to come to the next protest and see for themselves: “you can expect that the police and peacekeeping people will do their best to ensure safety and it was very effective.”
Arulampalam said that police officers in Hartford are trained to deescalate in such situations. “Federal agents are sent in to enforce and don’t care about what happens in communities that they run through, don’t care about the aftermath of those actions. They have very different directives and visions of success,” Arulampalam said. “In general, we don’t want violence in this city. This is a city that is working to build a community that is an antidote to the chaos we are seeing at the federal level.” 
At a separate press conference on Friday morning, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., supported Arulampalam and the city of Hartford in its handling of the incident and investigation.
Blumenthal decried the shooting of Good by an ICE agent and said that the killing was part of a pattern of excessive use of force on the part of ICE agents that has repeated across the U.S., according to a December report he produced with other lawmakers on the excessive use of force by ICE and CBP. “The pattern of escalating indefensible violence must be investigated, restrained and reformed,” he said.
Gov. Ned Lamont spoke after Blumenthal and echoed his horror at the Good killing. Lamont also commented on the events in Hartford on Thursday night. “As usual 99% of the folks were there peacefully, stepping up and saying this is not right. There was an incident behind the courthouse as you heard the mayor describe and I just want to urge each and every one of you: Make sure you exercise your right to free speech, exercise your right to protest, but you do it peacefully. Don’t let Fox News take one isolated incident behind and say, ‘see it’s happening on both sides.’ It’s not.”
Lamont commended Connecticut police who are “taught not to put gasoline on the flames but to put out the flames and let people get about their lives peacefully.”
Asked more about the incident by reporters, Lamont said, “This is the issue: ICE took an open window and shot somebody in the head and shot her dead and she was an innocent mother of three. I don’t want anything to distract from that. You’re doing just what President Trump says if there’s a demonstration here in Hartford, a couple of people do something they shouldn’t do, that’s what distracts. He takes advantage of issues and distractions like that. Don’t let that happen.”
Blumenthal added that he has been to countless Indivisible rallies in recent months across the state, and “they have been uniformly, peaceful, orderly, well-conducted. That’s Connecticut. And, we’ll see from the video, and I’ve seen some videos of what happened last night, for almost everyone in front of the courthouse, the demonstration and the protest was peaceful and orderly. We’ll know more about what happened in back of the courthouse when those two vehicles sought to leave it, because for me at least it’s not clear yet and there needs to be an investigation.”
At the same time, Blumenthal encouraged people to dissent and get out to protest. Blumenthal said that peaceful protest is “an obligation.”
“When people use violence, they undermine their cause. They play into the hands of authoritarian dictators. And the history of the rise of authoritarianism involves the invoking of violence as a pretext for cracking down on lawful dissent. That’s what we need to avoid.”
National protest organizations like ICE Out for Good have instructed protesters across the country to be nonviolent, follow the law and “bring your most peaceful attitude even in these tense times.”
Activist leadership in Connecticut contacted by The Connecticut Mirror were reluctant to speak about the incident in its aftermath. Several declined to be interviewed, some citing ongoing confusion about just what had happened and how the events were sparked.
On X, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said he had spoken with Arulampalam and echoed Blumenthal’s sentiment. “My team and I will continue to gather details,” he said. “People are right to be furious, but it’s important for our protest to be peaceful. The intent of DHS’s inhumanity is to provoke a fight. Don’t let them win.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026_0109_SR_HartfordCityHallICE_056-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-09 17:58:34.538092

(Photo courtesy of Nelson Thibault)At the Agent Orange Memorial wreath laying ceremony conducted in Sunset, Utah on Dec. 13, 2025, the flag of South Vietnam was prominently displayed opposite Old Glory. 
The placement of the yellow and red South Vietnamese flag at the ceremony was a symbolic gesture intended to send a meaningful message to Vietnamese-Americans living in the Beehive State.
The wreath laying event was an inaugural ceremony presided over by Larry Kerr, chairman of the Utah Agent Orange Veterans Foundation (UAOVF), at the site of the Agent Orange Memorial in Sunset Veterans Park.
On that momentous occasion, Larry wanted to recognize Vietnamese veterans who were U.S. allies during the Vietnam War. Those veterans were also exposed to Agent Orange and similar toxic herbicides.
Displaying the South Vietnamese flag at the wreath laying ceremony seemed like an appropriate way to express such a worthwhile message. So on the morning of the ceremony, Larry took the flag from his garage and brought it with him.
That particular flag has quite a notable history. Larry, a Vietnam veteran, brought the flag home from South Vietnam about 57 years earlier. The wreath laying ceremony afforded him a great opportunity to put it to good use.
After the flag was put on a short pole, it was set to the right of the U.S. flag. Each flag flanked the Agent Orange Memorial information stand, where a specially prepared wreath was laid.
A short distance beyond the stand, the partially completed monument towered high above the ground. Even without its panels and other attachments, the memorial is quite an imposing structure.
Larry plans to display the South Vietnamese flag at future UAOVF events. He feels that it will resonate with Utah’s Vietnamese-American community, because it represents something that was worth fighting for.
In the spring of 1975, that struggle to preserve freedom ended quite tragically with the fall of Saigon. And soon after, the displaying of a South Vietnamese national flag essentially came to an end as well.
At the wreath laying ceremony however, the yellow and red flag was displayed to pay tribute to South Vietnamese victims of Agent Orange exposure who struggled to preserve their freedom in an ill-fated and costly war.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Agent-Orange-wreath-horizontal-1024x585.jpg,,,2026-01-09 17:58:34.538092

The new contract was awarded on Jan. 1 and will cover a term of 10 years. As Belton Chalets held the previous contract, agency officials said in a press release that the public is not expected to experience any interruptions in service.
“Belton Chalets, Inc. has provided park visitors with exceptional and unique services at Granite Park and Sperry chalets for years,” Dave Roemer, Glacier Park superintendent, said in a statement. “We know that their passion for the chalets and their experience will serve the public and the park well.”
Granite Park Chalet and Sperry Chalet are two iconic backcountry lodges in Glacier, remnants of what used to be a system of nine Swiss-style chalets connected by trails built by the Great Northern Railroad.
The other chalets were destroyed by natural disasters or by park officials.
(Belton Chalet, a separate lodge outside of the park in West Glacier, is operated by a different concessioner.)
In 2017, a fire burning up the Sprague Creek Valley torched Sperry Chalet and gutted the 104-year-old dormitory. It was rebuilt over two years — a $12 million reconstruction effort that was supported by all three members of Montana’s then-congressional delegation, and former U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, a native of nearby Whitefish, helping make it a national priority.
Belton Chalets, Inc has a long history stewarding the park’s backcountry chalets. The family-run company operated the chalets from 1954-1992, Granite Park Chalet from 1996-97, Sperry Chalet 1999-2004 and both chalets again since 2005, according to the NPS.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GranitePark_1.jpg,,,2026-01-09 17:58:34.538092

(Photo and seal courtesy of the Iowa Judicial Branch)The Iowa Supreme Court says Iowans who are given court-appointed attorneys should not have to pay legal fees if the criminal charges against them are dismissed.
Friday’s ruling by the court stems from a case involving Ronald Pagliai, who was facing criminal charges related to allegations of shoplifting when he requested and was granted a court-appointed attorney. Two of the charges were later dropped after Pagliai agreed to plead guilty in two separate cases. He later argued that he shouldn’t have to reimburse the state of the cost of his defense in the cases that were dropped by prosecutors.
As part of Pagliai’s plea deal, the state had agreed to dismiss the two charges with the understanding that Pagliai would pay the costs in the dismissed cases, which included $329.85 to reimburse the state’s indigent defense fund, plus $160 in filing fees.

Pagliai then challenged the district court’s authority to assess costs against a defendant for charges the court had agreed to dismiss.
In its ruling, the Iowa Supreme Court found that the district court had no statutory authority to dispose of the cases by ordering Pagliai to pay defense costs in dismissed cases. It then remanded the matter to district court, giving the state two options as to how the case can proceed: The state can vacate only the order assessing fees and costs to Pagliai, or it can vacate the entire plea bargain, the resulting convictions, the sentences, and the order for payment.
The justices noted that if the state opts to reinstate the charges that had been dismissed as part of a previously agreed-to plea deal, if can then file “any additional charges supported by the available evidence.”
The American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa was among the public-interest groups that filed an amicus brief in the case, arguing that defendants shouldn’t foot the bill for legal fees when the state agrees to dismiss charges.
Alex Kornya, director of litigation for the Legal Aid Justice Center and cooperating attorney for the ACLU of Iowa in the case, said that while the court’s decision provides relief for Iowans moving forward, it also creates a dilemma for Iowans who may open themselves to additional charges by challenging the validity of their own court-ordered payments.
“That basic problem is that thousands of Iowans already, collectively, owe millions of dollars in cases, even though they were convicted of no crime,” he said. “It could present a difficult choice regarding the risk of the prosecution being able to refile charges. Realistically, that may prevent many people who have had debt assessed in the past from being able to take advantage of the court’s decision today.”

Rebels plan to appeal,Associated Press,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/09/ncaa-denies-trinidad-chambliss-waiver/,"Mississippi quarterback Trinidad Chambliss throws during the first half of the Fiesta Bowl NCAA college football playoff semifinal game against Miami, Thursday, Jan. 8, 2026, in Glendale, Ariz.","The NCAA on Friday denied Mississippi’s request to extend the eligibility of Trinidad Chambliss.
The Rebels star quarterback just finished his fifth year of college football in a 31-27 loss to Miami in the College Football Playoff semifinals on Thursday night.
He had planned to return to Ole Miss for one more year if the waiver was approved.
The NCAA said Ole Miss and Ferris State failed to provide adequate medical documentation to back up the request.
Ole Miss athletic director Keith Carter said his school will appeal the ruling.
“We are disappointed with today’s announcement by the NCAA and plan to appeal the decision to the Committee level,” Carter said in a social media post, in which he included the flag of Trinidad and Tobago. “Additionally, we will continue to work in conjunction with Trinidad’s representatives in other avenues of support.”
Tom Mars, who is an attorney for Chambliss, said he was disappointed but not surprised by the NCAA’s decision.
“The last time I checked, however, the only score that matters is the one at the end of the fourth quarter,” Mars said.

“I understand that Ole Miss will file an appeal with the NCAA. However, there’s now an opportunity to move this case to a level playing field where Trinidad’s rights will be determined by the Mississippi judiciary instead of some bureaucrats in Indianapolis who couldn’t care less about the law or doing the right thing,” Mars said. “Whether to pursue that course of action is a decision only Trinidad and his parents can make.”
After taking a redshirt his first season at Ferris State in 2021-22, Chambliss was held out in his second season for medical reasons. He played two more seasons at the Division II school, leading the Bulldogs to a national championship before transferring to Ole Miss before the start of this season. Ole Miss filed the waiver request with the NCAA in November.
Chambliss completed 294 of 445 passes (66.1%) for 3,937 yards with 22 touchdowns and three interceptions for Ole Miss (13-2), which set a school record for wins, including two after making the College Football Playoff for the first time. He ran for 527 yards and eight more TDs.
The NCAA said in its denial statement that approval of such waivers requires schools to submit medical documentation from a treating physician at the time of a student’s incapacitating injury or illness.
“The documents provided by Ole Miss and the student’s prior school include a physician’s note from a December 2022 visit, which stated the student-athlete was ‘doing very well’ since he was seen in August 2022,” the NCAA said. “Additionally, the student-athlete’s prior school indicated it had no documentation on medical treatment, injury reports or medical conditions involving the student-athlete during that time frame and cited ‘developmental needs and our team’s competitive circumstances’ as its reason the student-athlete did not play in the 2022-23 season.”
The NCAA noted that it initially provided a verbal denial on Dec. 8, which was 12 days before Ole Miss beat Tulane at home in the program’s first CFP game.
“To receive a clock extension, a student-athlete must have been denied two seasons of competition for reasons beyond the student’s or school’s control, and a ‘redshirt’ year can be used only once,” the statement reads. “One of the rules being cited publicly (Bylaw 12.6.4.2.2) is not the correct rule for the type of waiver requested by the school.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/08204555/AP26009092149854.jpg,,,2026-01-09 17:58:34.538092

(Photo by Robert H. Burton/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)TOPEKA — The consistent, dramatic decline in Kansas’ wild turkey population prompted the state in 2023 to forbid hunting them in the fall.
Simultaneously, an influx of funding and research is attempting to reverse wild turkey losses. 
The latest came recently when the Kansas state chapter of the National Wild Turkey Federation approved more than $126,000 for habitat enhancement and hunting education projects. The federation promised an additional $730,000.
The funds will be dispersed across Kansas to boost invasive species removal efforts, a Boy Scout habitat project, turkey ecology and toxicology research at Kansas State University, scholarships, sponsorships and a habitat specialist position. The funding is fueled by volunteers who raise money at banquets and fundraisers, according to a Tuesday news release.
Annie Farrell, the federation’s district biologist for Kansas and three other states, commended the volunteers.
“These volunteers are our boots on the ground, putting their hard-earned dollars back on the landscape to support critical projects that will greatly benefit the wild turkey,” she said. “Thanks to their dedication, it’s going to be a great year for conservation in Kansas.”
The wild turkey encompasses five subspecies, including the Eastern and the Rio Grande, which are found in Kansas along with a hybrid of the two subspecies. Wild turkey can be found in nearly every county in Kansas.
The Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks suspended the fall wild turkey hunting season in 2023 after years of restrictions.
Still, 13,862 turkeys were hunted and harvested in 2025, according to the department’s annual turkey harvest report.
In 2023, K-State received almost $2 million to conduct wild turkey research to deduce the root cause of the more than 40% decline since 2008.
Wild turkey populations were gravely diminished in the early 20th century because of human activity resulting in overhunting and habitat loss, according to the National Audubon Society.
The society’s annual Christmas Bird Count shows a steady increase in observations of wild turkey in Kansas beginning in the 1960s, when they were reintroduced into the state. Observations peaked in 2011 and have since declined to levels comparable to those of more than two decades ago.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/usfws-rio-grande-wild-turkey-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-09 17:58:34.538092

Steny Hoyer's announcement that he will not seek reelection to the 5th District seat that he has held for the last 45 years is expected to make an already crowded race more crowded. Much more crowded.,"Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th), then House majority leader, at a Maryland Democratic Party luncheon in Annapolis in 2020 -- when he was almost 40 years into his congressional tenure. (Photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Rep. Steny Hoyer’s announcement that he will not seek reelection to the 5th District seat that he has held for the last 45 years is expected to make an already crowded race more crowded. Much more crowded.
“It will probably unleash a bit of a free-for-all among folks who see that open seat now and would like to have a shot at serving in Congress – knowing that it would probably, if they win, be a safe seat for them for as long as they want to hold onto it,” said Todd Eberly, a professor of political science and public policy at St. Mary’s College of Maryland, where Hoyer serves on the Board of Trustees.
Even before Hoyer bowed out, nine people had filed to run in the 5th District, a Southern Maryland district that includes parts of Prince George’s and Anne Arundel counties and all of Calvert, Charles and St. Mary’s counties. As of Friday, there were five Democrats, two unaffiliated candidates and one Republican signed up for the seat, according to the state Board of Elections. A second Republican candidate who filed in April withdrew in October.
A number of notable elected officials may also get into the race. Prince George’s Democratic Dels. Adrian Boafo and Nicole Williams and Bowie Mayor Tim Adams have all been mentioned as possible candidates, should the seat come open, and there are likely others.
Besides getting more choices, 5th District voters — Democrats, at least — will also likely get a broader range of choices as Hoyer, a long a centrist Democrat, makes room for younger and probably more progressive candidates, experts say.
David Karol, an associate professor of government and politics at the University of Maryland, College Park said Hoyer was a mainstream Democrat who wanted to remain appealing to centrists. But the district has changed, Karol said, with larger numbers of minority voters, as has Washington, where increased political polarization is driving candidates farther to the right and left.
“His positioning reflected the environment in which he came up politically, and that was the way it was into his 40s and even early 50s,” Karol said. “But I think that his successor is likely to be African American, and not likely to have centrist leanings.”
‘We must respect and love one another’: Steny Hoyer tells the US House he’s retiring

Hoyer’s colleague, Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th) agreed.
“He almost certainly is going to be replaced by somebody more progressive than he is,” Raskin said. “Steny is definitely more conservative than the center of gravity within the Democratic caucus now. I mean, he is the product of a different political generation.”
While Hoyer’s successor may be ideologically distinct, that candidate would do well to follow Hoyer’s model of community service, Raskin said.
“In fairness to Steny, I think that they will certainly try to emulate his record of being connected to the community, and committed to strong constituent service,” Raskin said.
Even though it’s Hoyer’s seat, leading Democrats in Congress may not try to tip the scales in favor of one candidate, because the seat is in a safe district, Karol said. In the 2024 election, there were 2.5 registered Democrats for every registered Republican in the district, according to a board of elections report.
“In some cases, the party establishment, such as it is, tries to consolidate around one person, but that often happens when it’s a competitive district and they’re trying to get the candidate who can beat the other side and hold the seat. That’s not really a concern here,” Karol said.
Two Democratic challengers from Anne Arundel County – Quincy Bareebe and Harry Jarin, both of whom have been running since October – released statements Thursday thanking Hoyer for his decades of service in Congress.
“Congressman Hoyer’s retirement marks the close of a historic chapter in Maryland’s public life,” said Bareebe, who runs a caregiving and assisted living businesses, and was one of three Hoyer challengers in 2024. “I am deeply thankful for his decades of commitment to our communities and for the example he has set for all who believe public service is about building a better future together.”
Jarin, 36, a volunteer firefighter, echoed those statements in an interview Thursday afternoon, crediting Hoyer for making a “very tough decision to pass the reins to a new generation.” But Jarin focused mostly on improvements needed in the Democratic Party as a whole, such as choosing candidates who don’t operate the same way as Hoyer.
“Our old way of doing politics, that is what created the conditions for a fascist movement to gain power in this country,” Jarin said. “The ideal that we would just try to hit the reset button and reset American politics back to the way we operated 10 or 20 years ago, frankly that’s insane. We need a very different path forward.”
‘There’s no one that doesn’t love Steny’; official Maryland reacts to Hoyer’s retirement

 
Among other potential contenders, Williams told Maryland Matters on Wednesday night that she’s giving “strong consideration” to a run, before thanking Hoyer for “all of his years of service to Prince George’s County, to the 5th Congressional District, to the state of Maryland and really to the nation. He is going to leave big shoes for us to fill.”
Boafo worked several years ago as Hoyer’s campaign manager, one of many current Democratic officials in the state who worked for Hoyer during his 60 years in elected office.
“I saw up close his distinct warmth toward everyone he encountered, his dedication to fighting for what’s right, and inimitable ability to assess the toughest challenges and win for the people,” Boafo said in a statement. “Maryland and this country is better because of Steny Hoyer’s service. May God bless his well-earned retirement.”
As for whom Hoyer might support to replace him, he’s not saying right now.
“I have some thoughts, but I’m not going to discuss them today,” he said. “We’ll see who’s running.
“There’s obviously going to be people who are thinking about running, who have been very close to me and have been very helpful to me through the years. I’ll take a look,” Hoyer said. “At some point in time, I may tell my friends and neighbors, i.e. their future constituents, who I think would be good to follow in my footsteps.”

Dec. 16, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceFollowing the Michigan Public Service Commission’s decision to sign off on a set of contracts for DTE Energy to supply 1.4 gigawatts of power to a data center in Saline Township, Michigan’s attorney general and a coalition of environmental and consumer advocacy groups have each filed a petition asking regulators to rehear the case. 
During its Dec. 18 meeting, the public service commission granted DTE’s request for ex parte approval, allowing the contracts to move forward without intervention from outside organizations, which would be able to conduct legal discovery and file testimony on the contracts. 
Ahead of the meeting, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and the coalition, made up of the Michigan Environmental Council, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club and the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan, advocated heavily for a contested case on the matter, arguing that it would allow intervenors to ensure that DTE customers are protected from concerns like increased energy rates due to heavy energy demand from the facility.
While the Commission approved both contracts, that approval hinges on several conditions, including requirements for DTE to update its tariff  structure for large-energy load customers, like data centers, and file an amended renewable energy plan to include a comparison of the resources it needs to meet the state’s requirement to provide 100% clean energy by 2040, both with and without the data center’s energy load.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The commission set a 30-day deadline for DTE to agree to the terms laid out in the Dec. 18 order.
In a statement released Friday, Nessel reiterated her disappointment in the commission’s decision to “fast-track DTE’s secret data center contracts without holding a contested case hearing,” criticizing the heavy redactions of the publicly available copies of the contracts.
“This was an irresponsible approach that cut corners and shut out the public and their advocates. Granting approval of these contracts ex parte serves only the interests of DTE and the billion-dollar businesses involved, like Oracle, OpenAI, and Related Companies, not the Michigan public the Commission is meant to protect,” Nessel said. 
Nessel’s petition for a rehearing challenges the commission’s authority to approve the contracts without a contested hearing. The petition also raises questions on how the conditions set by the commission would prevent DTE from passing along costs to serve the data center, which is under development by tech giant Oracle and data center developer Related Digital for use by ChatGPT-creator OpenAI. 
Matt Helms, the commission’s spokesperson, said in a statement that the body looks forward to considering Nessel’s petition for a rehearing, but denied any claims that they had not sufficiently reviewed the contracts. 
The commission’s staff thoroughly reviewed unredacted contracts to ensure customers are protected, Helms said.
“The Commission’s order in this case recognizes the utility’s obligation to serve this customer under Michigan law while requiring the strongest consumer protections for a data center power contract in the country – protections that would not be available under existing tariffs without the Commission’s approval of these contracts,” Helms said. 
Michigan Environmental Council, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club and the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan raised their own questions on how the conditions laid out by the commission would protect customers from increased energy rates, alongside other concerns, like how the conditions on the contracts will be enforced.
In a statement to the Michigan Advance, DTE spokesperson Ryan Lowry argued that the contracts protect their customers from subsidizing the data center’s energy rate. The company will continue to follow the regulatory process, Lowry said.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire state lawmakers passed two bills related to abortion this week: one to ensure that a health care provider who conscientiously objects to abortion can keep their job if they refuse to aid in an abortion, and another that criminalizes driving a minor to an abortion appointment.
House Bill 232, which was passed by the House Thursday, would enshrine into law the right for a provider to conscientiously object to participating in an abortion. It would empower any provider who is discriminated against by their employer for not participating in an abortion to sue for damages. And it would require employers to place an 8½-by-11-inch poster in the workplace entitled “Freedom of Conscience for Health Care Providers” that outlines employees’ rights not to participate in abortions. The law would not apply to employees of health care institutions that provide abortion as a major part of its services or employees who are the only health care provider present in an emergency situation.
Abortion has been legal up to 24 weeks of pregnancy in New Hampshire since 2021. Republican leaders, who control the state House and Senate, and governor’s office, promised on the campaign trail they would not expand that restriction. Gov. Kelly Ayotte, in her inaugural address in 2025, promised to veto any legislation to further restrict abortion.
On the House floor Thursday, Katy Peternel, a Wolfeboro Republican and co-sponsor of the bill, argued the legislation wasn’t an abortion restriction, but rather simply a measure to “protect health care professionals from being forced to participate in the ending of a human life.” She said the bill is important to “(allow) New Hampshire to attract providers who value motherhood and family.”
Peternel argued that “for many health care providers, abortion represents the deliberate taking of human life, an unnatural violent separation of unborn children from their mother. … No one should have to choose between their profession and moral integrity.”
Peternel has long been a vocal proponent of strengthening abortion restrictions. In early 2025, she unsuccessfully attempted to ban abortions after 15 weeks. She backed away and withdrew that bill before it was given a floor vote.
“This bill does not ban or restrict access to abortion,” Peternel said Thursday about HB 232. “It simply brings New Hampshire in line with 47 other states with conscience clauses.”
Democrats didn’t buy that argument.
“Make no mistake about it,” Rep. Zoe Manos, a Stratham Democrat, said. “This is an anti-abortion bill.”
Manos argued that while Republicans claim the bill is about “a health care provider’s right of conscience,” it is actually an effort to allow “someone to turn a patient away from accessing abortion.” She alleged that the bill would allow anyone working in a facility, even a receptionist, to refuse to participate in an abortion. “Should a receptionist have the power to deny health care to patients in New Hampshire?” she asked.
The House voted, 184-164, to approve the bill. All but six Republicans voted for it, while all but one Democrat voted against it. The bill will now be considered by the Senate. If the Senate follows suit, the bill will go to the governor’s desk for final approval.
Meanwhile, the Senate also approved an abortion-related bill on Wednesday. House Bill 191 seeks to make helping a minor travel to receive an abortion — or any other procedure — without parental permission illegal.
The bill has already passed the House. In its original form, the legislation was focused entirely on abortion. However, it was subsequently amended in the House to outlaw transporting a minor for any procedure. First offenses of this bill would result in a misdemeanor and a third offense would be a felony. In March, the bill was passed by the House, 180-164, with the broader language.
Wednesday’s bill similarly fell upon party lines during debate.
Sen. Tara Reardon, a Concord Democrat, called the bill “duplicative,” noting that state law already requires parental consent for a child to receive an abortion. She also argued the bill — having been expanded to all surgical procedures — could criminalize transporting children to doctor’s appointments as routine as the removal of wisdom teeth. 
“If I ask my neighbor, my sister, my mother to take my son to the dentist, is that explicit or implicit consent?” Reardon said. “It’s debatable. It’s a gamble. And a criminal misdemeanor is the price for that.”
She called it “draconian, punitive, and unnecessary when the Legislature has previously crafted a solution to this issue.”
The Senate voted, 16-8, along party lines to approve the bill. Before passing it, the Senate amended the bill. Senators changed the bill text from “a surgical procedure for the minor” to “a surgical procedure for the minor or a termination of the minor’s pregnancy.” They also removed a requirement the House implemented for notarized consent, changing it to simply written consent. The bill will now return to the House for the amendment to be considered.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/statehousesnow-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-09 17:58:34.538092

She moved to the city with her wife and 6-year-old son almost a year ago.
Good’s wife, Rebecca Good, told the Washington Post that they had stopped to support neighbors when she was shot by the ICE agent, who has been identified as Jonathan Ross by the Star Tribune. 
“On Wednesday, January 7th, we stopped to support our neighbors. We had whistles. They had guns,” Rebecca Good said in a statement to the Post and other media outlets on Friday.
“We were raising our son to believe that no matter where you come from or what you look like, all of us deserve compassion and kindness,” the statement continues. “Renee lived this belief every day. She is pure love. She is pure joy. She is pure sunshine.”
Renee Good, 37, was a mother to a 15-year-old daughter and two sons, ages 12 and 6, her first husband told the Post. Online records and interviews with media outlets from family and friends paint her as a caring person and an avid writer who enjoyed movies, making art, singing and playing guitar. Her first husband described her as a devoted Christian to the Post.
She studied creative writing at Old Virginia University in Norfolk, Va., graduating in December 2020. She won an undergraduate poetry prize in 2020 for her poem “On Learning to Dissect Fetal Pigs,” which the contest judge described as “a meditation that leads the reader into the unknown.”
“May Renee’s life be a reminder of what unites us: freedom, love, and peace,” university president Brian O. Hemphill said in a statement. “My hope is for compassion, healing, and reflection at a time that is becoming one of the darkest and most uncertain periods in our nation’s history.”
She was originally from Colorado Springs, Colo. She lived in Kansas City, Mo., with her wife before moving to Minnesota. Their former neighbor in Kansas City told the Post that the couple said they wanted to move out of the red state after President Donald Trump was elected in 2024.
Her second husband, Tim Macklin, died in 2023 and was a military veteran who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, reported the Post. He was also a comedian with whom she co-hosted a podcast, according to a post on the Old Virginia University English department Facebook page.
A faculty member who taught her, Kent Wascom, described her to the Post as a poet who was focused on improving her fiction writing and who, unlike peers, never talked about politics.
“She was kind and talented, a working class mom who put herself through school despite circumstances that would’ve crumpled the pathetic rich boy politicians who sadistically abetted her murder,” Wascom said in an X post.
Good described herself as a “poet and writer and wife and mom and sh*tty guitar strummer from Colorado” who is “experiencing Minneapolis” on what appears to be her now-private Instagram page.

The Office of Childhood in the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, which found it could not access the funds earlier this week, had been unable to explain the delay to child care providers because it had not received communication from the federal government before Thursday evening.
“We know how important these payments are to providers, and this is our utmost priority,” said Office of Childhood Assistant Commissioner Deidre Anderson-Barbee in the press release.
The department submitted a “comprehensive breakdown” Friday morning to meet the requirements of a federal initiative called “Defend the Spend,” its spokesman told The Independent. Defend the Spend, a system created by the now-dissolved Department of Government Efficiency, requires recipients of federal funds to justify each transaction before they can receive payment.
Although the state office has submitted the required documentation, child care providers still don’t know when they can expect to receive payment. 
Missouri waiting on $25.7 million payment from feds to reimburse child care providers

Lisa Scheer, director of Baden Christian Child Care in St. Louis, told The Independent that the message from the state office brings little relief.
“It’s an answer, but it’s not an answer anyone wants to hear,” Scheer said. “To be honest, there’s not going to be an answer until they say, ‘We’re paying you.”
Scheer said her child care center relies heavily on the federal funds because each of the 45 children the center serves participates in the subsidy program. Families in Missouri must earn no more than 150% of the federal poverty level to qualify.
“Our families really rely on our services for food, for safety,” Scheer said. “We provide area transportation and really just a safe haven for our neighborhood and community.”
U.S. Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary Jim O’Neill on Dec. 30 announced in a social media post that all states would be required to justify their child care expenses in order to access support from the federal Child Care and Development Fund.
On Monday the federal department froze child care payments to five states — all with Democrat-led governments.
The state’s Office of Childhood said Friday that the federal request for information about Missouri’s child care subsidy program indicates “Missouri child care funds have not been frozen.”
Before that communication, the cause of the delay wasn’t clear. 
Casey Hanson, deputy director of Kids Win Missouri, told The Independent that the uncertainty has made the funding disruption more painful for child care providers who operate on very tight margins.
In a meeting of around 160 providers Wednesday, Hanson said, many were “frustrated and upset.”
Some providers who mostly serve families who receive subsidies “are at a point to be turning [those families] away, especially if they don’t have reserves, and a lot of small providers really don’t,” Hanson said.
Scheer, who was in the meeting, said she’s trying to delay costs where she can. She agreed with her husband that she won’t draw a paycheck until federal funding comes through.  But she realizes her employees, who are mostly single women, can’t do that.
While Scheer said she is committed to keeping her doors open, she’s not sure how long the center would be able to operate without subsidy payments.
“It’s trying to make sure my employees’ needs are met so that they can still show up for children, so children’s needs are met, so that parents can still go to work and be parents for their children,” Scheer said.
“It’s just a lot of unknown.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_8677-1024x615.jpeg,,,2026-01-09 17:12:39.732563

(Photo courtesy DWS)Homeless shelters across the state received funding to keep people warm amid a statewide cold snap thanks to a first-ever, state-funded grant program from the new Office of Housing. 
The statewide Office of Housing emerged as one of Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s priorities during the legislative session last year. The small team within the state’s Department of Workforce Solutions is tasked with overseeing the allocation of more than $100 million on a statewide strategy for affordable housing and homelessness prevention measures, including about $20 million the Legislature approved specifically for “anti-homelessness initiatives.”
That’s the fund where the office found $820,000 to provide to several dozen statewide facilities, including transitional living centers, domestic violence shelters and others, to increase their capacity and warmth this winter, DWS Secretary Sarita Nair told Source New Mexico on Friday. 
Individual shelters typically rely on local governments or private contributions to keep unhoused people warm during the winter months. And they often come up short funding-wise, according to a survey of housing nonprofit organizations the Office of Housing conducted shortly after launching last year, Nair said.

“This hasn’t been a role that the state’s played historically,” Nair said of funding the warming centers. “But it has always been a challenge for a lot of these shelters to be able to expand for the additional demand they see in the winter.”
Shelters that applied for the funding received up to $20,000 grants they could use on supplies like cots, portable heaters or blankets and generally to increase the number of people they’re able keep warm during the winter. 
“We heard from some folks that, ‘This is the first time that we’ve been able to heat every room in our shelter,’” Nair said. “Really basic things, but that’s how you expand the capacity.”
A news release from the office said the funding has already proven particularly useful in rural areas, where “providers reported improved building heating, increased street outreach efforts, expanded bed capacity, and the ability to offer extended overnight hours with hot meals.” 
Nair also said the Office of Housing is already preparing to execute a similar grant funding round to help shelters keep unhoused people from overheating during the summer months. 
“We know that cooling centers are becoming equally important,” she said. “And so we would love to do another round of that, if we get more funding.”

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Five Democratic-led states are suing the Trump administration over what their attorneys general say is an unlawful funding freeze for safety-net programs that support low-income families and their children. 
The Trump administration froze $10 billion for the Child Care Development Fund, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, and the Social Services Block Grant programs in Colorado, Minnesota, New York, California and Illinois. The states all have Democratic governors.
The Administration for Children and Families, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, told the states they will not get money for the programs while the federal government conducts a “thorough review of the State’s use of funding for compliance and alignment with statutory requirements.”

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, says the president does not have the authority to unilaterally freeze funding approved by Congress for the states. It marks Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser’s 50th legal challenge to Trump administration policies. 
“The people who will be affected today are people who are struggling to make ends meet — parents whose child care assistance is now being threatened so that they face impossible decisions,” Weiser said in a press call Friday.
Other attorneys general on the call included Rob Bonta of California, Letitia James of New York, Keith Ellison of Minnesota and Kwame Raoul of Illinois.
The administration’s targeting of the five states is “pure partisan politics,” Bonta said. James said the administration froze the funding based on unsubstantiated allegations of fraud.
“This unlawful funding freeze is about one thing: Punishing Democratic states that oppose the president,” James said. 
The lawsuit asks the court to declare the freeze unconstitutional and stop the federal government from implementing it.
“We believe that if we can’t persuade the Trump administration to do what is right and to follow the law, we believe the courts will give relief to the people who need it so desperately,” Ellison said. “One thing is abundantly clear: Donald Trump wants to use the mechanism of government to punish people and states that he doesn’t like.”
The administration’s move to freeze funding based on suspicion of fraud is not based on the results of any investigations, Ellison said, and the president has not looked at ways the states have held people accountable for trying to defraud the affected programs. 
Minnesota has experienced widespread fraud cases involving misuse of government funds for safety-net programs.
Raoul said the funding freeze has nothing to do with fraud and that his office “regularly works to investigate and prosecute individuals who defraud Illinois taxpayers.” 
“If the President was serious about rooting out fraud, his administration would be investing more resources in partnering with states and supporting states’ efforts to root out fraud and abuse,” Raoul said. 
Colorado receives about $136 million in block funding for TANF, administered through Colorado Works, every year. In 2024, a Colorado family of three received a maximum monthly TANF benefit of $585, according to the National Center for Children in Poverty. Last year, the state was allocated about $140 million in federal funds to pay for care for children in low-income families, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen) talks with people testifying during the Senate budget and appropriations committee, which he chairs, on Jan. 9, 2026, at the Statehouse in Trenton. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Two New Jersey legislative panels pushed through over $128 million in proposed new spending Thursday night without explanation or public comment, prompting outcry from good government advocates who warned that such secrecy erodes the public’s trust.
Details of the new spending were posted online Friday midday, long after the Senate’s budget and appropriations committee approved it in the last two minutes of a six-hour hearing at Trenton’s Statehouse. The vote on the bill came after most spectators — and even some committee members — had left for the night.
The Assembly’s appropriations committee also approved the bill Thursday, long after nightfall near the end of its eight-hour meeting.
The bill verbiage offers brief, vague descriptions of 18 items of proposed spending. They include funding for a state supercomputer, World Cup promotions, and capital improvements at county buildings, schools, and a hospital.

Peter Chen, a senior analyst with progressive think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective, was at the Senate hearing and stood to question the spending, but Sen. Paul Sarlo, the committee’s chair, called for a vote without allowing public comment.
“This is, unfortunately, part of a pattern of a lack of transparency around the budget and around how the state spends the public’s funds,” Chen said Friday. “Each of these programs might be a good idea, but I certainly have questions about $25 million for a supercomputer and a sort of blanket dollar amount for World Cup preparations. I think the public should have a right to ask questions about and see details on these kinds of proposals before they’re voted on.”
Sarlo, before the vote, described the budget bill as supplemental appropriations that were a mix of spending legislators approved in recent weeks, spending that Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration requested, and “let’s call it repairs or corrections that were made as part of the budget process.”
Stella Porter, a Murphy spokeswoman, declined to comment.
In both committees, the Democrats supported the bill, while Republicans voted against it. The bill was sponsored by Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) and Assemblywoman Eliana Pintor Marin (D-Essex), the lower chamber’s Democratic budget officer.
Sen. Declan O’Scanlon (R-Monmouth) voted against the bill. He told the New Jersey Monitor Friday that both the process and the extra spending are “nuts.”
“There’s no reason to add $128 million in spending — ever, quite frankly, during the course of the year. It’s just all political giveaways. What about the other 500 good causes out there? Why these 18?” O’Scanlon said. “We’ve been hearing about the looming Medicaid cuts that we’re going to have to deal with. Why isn’t this money going to that, if we have it? It’s ridiculous.”
The proposed new spending includes:

$38 million in capital improvements at the Bergen New Bridge Medical Center in Paramus ($12 million); the Hudson County Schools of Technology ($10 million); Kean University ($5 million); the Mercer County Connection building in Hamilton ($2 million); and unspecified capital improvements in Union County ($9 million).
$26 million to the state Economic Development Authority for events marketing, $20 million of which will go to the 2026 FIFA World Cup Host Committee to promote statewide tourism. First lady Tammy Murphy is chair of the committee’s board of directors.
$25 million for an “AI Supercomputer Initiative,” in which a university would host “a new state-of-the-art supercomputer.”
$15 million for a new regional county jail in Camden County ($13 million) and for emergency vehicles and communications upgrades in Gloucester and Salem counties ($2 million).
$10 million in unspecified counties “to achieve efficiencies and future cost savings in the provision of services at the local level.”
$5 million for the state Office of the Food Security Advocate to research food insecurity and fund grants and partnerships to reduce hunger.
$4 million for the Middlesex County Network Operations Center.
$2 million for homelessness services in Burlington County.
$1.5 million for the Old Barracks Museum in Trenton.
$1 million to fund transportation for special-needs adults for the Larc Norcross School in Bellmawr.

The new spending comes six months after New Jersey lawmakers approved a record-high $58.8 billion budget that included a number of cuts and controversial diversions that have spurred ongoing protests and calls for restored funding. That budget also included over $700 million for lawmakers’ pet projects that critics have condemned as pork spending, even though Murphy had warned federal cuts and other budget stressors would require “hard decisions.”
O’Scanlon, as the Senate Republicans’ budget officer, has long railed against Legislature’s budget process, in which lawmakers are asked to vote on a lengthy annual budget at the end of June, just hours after they first see it. The criticism is not just partisan, with advocates long calling for more transparency too.
Thursday’s spending bill was just one of many added at the last-minute to both committees’ agendas, which O’Scanlon also blasted as an “irresponsible” failure of transparency.
“Taxpayers deserve far better than this broken process,” he said.

The bill will be up for a vote before both full chambers Monday, the final voting sessions of the current legislative session. Murphy then must sign it for it to become law. His last day as governor is Jan. 20.

Polk, Woodbury, Muscatine and other Iowa counties have been sued by numerous jail inmates in recent months, each alleging they’ve been unlawfully detained in county jails by ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
An exact count of all the lawsuits against Iowa jails is difficult to calculate given the fact that Iowa’s county jails typically don’t disclose the names of inmates who are being held at the direction of ICE. In addition, public access to the federal court records related to those detentions is tightly restricted.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
However, the available records show Polk County, ICE and DHS are named as defendants in at least three additional cases recently filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
Lt. Mark Chance of the Polk County Sheriff’s Office said Friday that 68 of the 993 inmates now housed at the Polk County Jail are detainees of DHS or ICE.
Nationally and in Iowa, many of the lawsuits surrounding ICE detainees involve the Trump administration’s six-month-old effort to expand its “mandatory detention” policy. Under that policy, ICE is holding people in jail indefinitely as their immigration cases proceed, while arguing those individuals are not entitled to a hearing where they can argue for their release on bond.
Politico recently reported that more than 300 federal judges, including appointees of every president since Ronald Reagan, have rejected the administration’s “mandatory detention” theory in more than 1,600 cases.
The courts’ near-universal rejection of the administration’s position has not prevented the U.S. Department of Justice from continuing to use that rationale to jail people indefinitely. In fact, the DOJ recently appealed one judge’s ruling against ICE after it resulted in a woman’s release from the Muscatine County Jail.
Polk County man detained during traffic stop
One of the newly filed cases involves Ulises Ramirez Cruz, who sued Polk County and ICE over his detention and the refusal of the immigration courts to provide him with a hearing at which he could argue for his release on bond.
Court records indicate Ramirez Cruz has lived in Iowa for five years. He alleges that ICE agents — identified in court records only as T. Staudinger, Scroggins, Palmer and Hanson — waited outside his house on Nov. 7, 2025, and then pulled him over after he left the house, got into his car and drove away.
U.S. Attorney David Waterman argued in court that Ramirez Cruz is not entitled to a bond hearing and is subject to mandatory detention. In a recent ruling against the government, U.S. District Court Judge Stephen Locher noted he has rejected the DOJ’s arguments in at least three other cases that have come before him, and that judges around the country have “overwhelmingly” issued similar decisions.
Locher’s order directs the immigration court to provide Ramirez Cruz with an opportunity to argue for his release on bond while the underlying immigration case proceeds.
‘Punitive detention’ alleged in Polk County case 
The second recent case involves a Polk County Jail inmate, Luis Pedroso, a citizen of Cuba who has been in the United States for four and a half years. Pedroso has applied for status as a legal permanent resident of the United States, but as part of the approval process, he must prove he’s not ineligible on public-health grounds, which would involve a physical examination to rule out drug abuse and communicable diseases.
Under federal regulations, that examination must be provided by a physician selected by or approved by immigration authorities. Attorneys for Pedroso argue that the jail, Polk County Health Department and ICE are all unwilling or unable to provide Pedroso with a physician so the examination can be conducted. ICE is also unwilling to transfer Pedroso to a different jail so the examination can take place, they allege.
Pedroso’s attorneys claim ICE and the county have, in effect, denied Pedroso his status as a legal permanent resident and violated his right to due process.
“Keeping Pedroso in detention for the purpose of adjudicating his claim in immigration court transforms his detention into a punitive detention intending to punish him for the fact that he is eligible for legal permanent residency,” the lawsuit alleges.
The defendants in the case have yet to file a response.
U.S. resident for 35 years, in jail for four months 
A third lawsuit involving the Polk County Jail revolves around Amir Rahimi of Centerville, a native of Iran who has lived in the United States for 35 years.
In his lawsuit against the county, ICE and DHS, Rahimi alleges he has been married to a native-born U.S. citizen for 33 years, with whom he has three children. The couple’s eldest son is in the U.S. Air Force and is currently deployed overseas, the lawsuit claims.
Rahimi alleges he was detained by federal agents when he stopped at an ICE office for a routine, scheduled appointment on July 22, 2025. At the time, he claims, ICE gave no reason for his detention except to tell him they were currently “seeking a third country for your removal” — suggesting the agency’s plan is to deport him not to Iran, but to some other country.
“After four months of detention, the legal justification for his detention still remains unclear and he has been provided with no explanation of the change in his circumstances that resulted in the deprivation of his liberty,” the lawsuit alleges.
The lawsuit seeks a court order preventing Rahimi’s continued detention, citing alleged violations of Rahimi’s due process rights and the federal Immigration and Nationality Act.
Feds appeal ruling in Muscatine County case 
In addition to the newly filed lawsuits, a fourth lawsuit involving the Muscatine County Jail continues to move forward despite a judge’s ruling in the case in early November.
That case centers on Maria Enriquez Reyes, who entered the United States from Mexico near Sasabe, Arizona, on Sept. 23, 2023, with her son, now 10 years old, and her husband. At the time, the family claimed they were fleeing persecution. They were detained briefly by the U.S. Border Patrol before being released on their own recognizance.
Reyes and her family subsequently filed formal applications for asylum to escape what they called persecution by Mexican drug cartels that are now recognized as terrorists by the U.S. government.
On Sept. 2, 2025, with that application still pending, the Reyes family went to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Cedar Rapids for a prescheduled “check in” appointment. According to court records, ICE agents accosted Reyes at the office and then sent her to the Muscatine County Jail. An immigration judge then denied her request for a bond hearing.
Reyes sued in U.S. District Court, and on Nov. 3, 2025, Judge Locher ruled in her favor, noting that the  majority of courts around the nation have rejected the administration’s interpretation of the law as requiring mandatory detention.
Locher noted that Reyes has lived in the United States with her family for two years and has no record of any criminal activity or dangerous conduct.
In ordering the immigration court to provide Reyes with a hearing on her request for pretrial release on bond, Locher wrote that “ICE itself obviously did not believe she was subject to mandatory detention” when they released her on how own recognizance in September 2023 and again in February 2025.
Court records indicate Reyes was granted bond after a hearing on Nov. 7, 2025, and was released from custody three days later on a $6,000 bond.
Despite Locher’s ruling and Reyes’ subsequent release, the U.S. Department of Justice is now appealing Locher’s ruling.

Community Colleges for Iowa will ask for additional funding and Last-Dollar Scholarship changes in the upcoming legislative session. (Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)With Iowa’s community college system set to celebrate 60 years of serving students, its leaders are getting ready to work with the Iowa Legislature to potentially implement new degree programs and curriculum.
Community Colleges for Iowa Executive Director Emily Shields said she agrees with lawmakers that community colleges are “one of Iowa’s best kept secrets,” and she hopes community colleges can receive the additional funding and program support to expand affordability and access for high school, college-age and adult learners.
Rep. Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, and Sen. Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia — chairs of the Iowa House Higher Education Committee and the Iowa Senate Education Committee, respectively — have said that community colleges will be a focus of the upcoming legislative session. Evans called community colleges one of Iowa’s “hidden gems” that the state needs to do a better job of promoting.
The Iowa Legislature created the statewide community college system 60 years ago this year, Shields said, and it has been a “national model” ever since.

“I just want people to know how much is available to them, affordably and locally, and our folks are so humble, so it is hard for me to get community college folks to brag on themselves and really talk about the great things that are available,” Shields said. “So to hear a legislator recognizing that is wonderful, and we want to continue to promote this incredible resource.”
New degrees, changing curriculum on the table this session
Community colleges will be asking for a $12 million increase in state funding for the next fiscal year, Shields said, mainly to keep up with increasing costs of goods and services and to keep pay and benefits competitive. Like the previous year, when community colleges implemented a funding formula designed and approved by college presidents to level out the institutions receiving more or less per-student funding, this additional funding will also further that process.
Some of those funds would also go toward implementing bachelor’s degree programs at community colleges, Shields said — if the Legislature decides to turn that potential into a reality.
Community Colleges for Iowa released a report in October 2025 exploring other states’ efforts to incorporate baccalaureate degrees into their academic offerings and what would be needed for Iowa to do the same, after prompting from Iowa lawmakers in the previous legislative session. Collins said implementing new community college degree programs will be a priority this session, but Shields said the usual state funding request won’t cover the costs entirely.
In addition to general state aid, Shields said Community Colleges for Iowa plans to request a $20 million fund for the creation of baccalaureate degrees at community colleges. The money will act as startup funding for these programs.
“That’s one of the things that we learned from other states, is that while the programs can be self-sustaining, it’s difficult to get them off the ground without initial funding to cover the costs related to hiring new faculty, training them, equipment, before the tuition is coming in the door,” Shields said.
Shields said introducing new kinds of degrees to community colleges wouldn’t change their collective mission so much as build upon it. The system’s mission is focused on workforce, credentials and degrees, as well as meeting unmet needs in local areas.
With 15 community colleges operating in more than 100 locations across Iowa and offering a more affordable education than public and some private universities, Shields said if community colleges can identify the needs of their local communities and develop bachelor’s degree programs to address them, these institutions “are uniquely positioned” to meet needs based on both affordability and geographical accessibility.
“Looking at where there are people who aren’t getting a bachelor’s degree now, but could and would if it was offered at their local community college, that’s the population that I know the Legislature will be considering, and we’re excited about this conversation,” Shields said.
Another priority Collins has discussed is further attempts to change core curriculum requirements at public universities, which he pointed out would impact community colleges as well. While it depends on the college, Shields said around half of community college students transfer to a four-year institution, and any changes community colleges would need to make to curriculum to keep the transfer process smooth and seamless just depends on what the to-be-introduced legislation targets.
Community colleges are also hoping to make changes to the Last-Dollar Scholarship Program, a scholarship fund which Shields said has been underspent, especially as the list of career fields included in the scholarship has been limited.
The Last-Dollar Scholarship Program provides eligible students attending a community college with enough money to fill any gaps left between their financial aid and the cost of tuition and fees. The Iowa Workforce Development Board voted in spring 2025 to limit the number of job fields that students must enroll in a program related to in order to receive Last-Dollar Scholarship funding, a decision that eliminated careers in law enforcement, medical and dental assisting, wastewater and more.
Shields said the program has been underspent the last couple of years, due to an income cap implemented a few years ago and what jobs were eligible for the program, and the new limitations on eligible job fields will “constrict” the money that’s supposed to be going to students even more.
“We’re looking for some legislative changes to expand that so the funds are getting to the students that need it,” Shields said.
Proposed legislation to address college transfers, career programs
One bill has already been filed ahead of the Jan. 12 start of the session, which would make changes to requirements for career academy courses, the articulation agreement between community colleges and state universities and programming aimed at helping high school students afford a concurrent education.
The proposed legislation, if adopted, would require career academies to offer at least two units of secondary education, one of which must meet requirements of a “district-to-community college sharing or concurrent enrollment program,” the bill explanation stated.
The statewide articulation agreement between community colleges and the Iowa Board of Regents, which governs Iowa’s public universities, would also be required to allow the transfer of career and technical education credits alongside academic credits.
Current law requires the Iowa Department of Education to create a fund to help high school students attend career and technical education classes relating to high-demand careers over the summer if the Legislature appropriates funds to such an initiative. The bill would require this fund be created regardless of whether money is appropriated to it or not.
A fund of $600,000 does exist for summer career and technical education, Shields said, but the need has far outweighed the funding. She said the potential of putting more money toward students who want to further their education and training would hopefully better address demand.
The bill would also require school districts that create personalized academic and career plans for students in eighth grade to also discuss with them opportunities within the school district to earn relevant college credits and “industry-recognized credentials,” the bill explanation stated.
Shields said conversations around career and technical education credit transfers, as well as establishing more dedicated funding for high school students hoping to earn those credits, have been ongoing for a couple of years as concurrent enrollment has grown.
“We’re excited anytime transfer is made easier for our students, because we want them to transfer on if that’s what’s in their plans, and it is the most difficult for career and technical education students,” Shields said.

The Natrona County District Attorney maintains the Wyoming Legislature was acting in its legal authority. 
The post Weston County clerk subpoena was valid, court filings argue appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Legislature served a valid subpoena to Weston County Clerk Becky Hadlock last fall and had the authority to do so, according to the latest filings in the criminal case against the embattled clerk. 
Hadlock pleaded not guilty in November to a misdemeanor charge accusing her of defying a legislative subpoena. Lawmakers subpoenaed the clerk in September to compel her to attend a meeting in Casper as part of an investigation into her conduct surrounding an initial miscount and audit in the 2024 general election. 
Despite the subpoena, she did not attend the meeting, informing the committee ahead of time that she had a scheduling conflict. Lawmakers subsequently pursued criminal charges. In November, the Natrona County District Attorney’s Office charged Hadlock with a misdemeanor for failing to appear. 
The subpoena, however, was void because lawmakers’ investigation was illegal, Ryan Semerad, Hadlock’s attorney, argued in a December motion to dismiss the case. 
More specifically, Semerad argued, the investigation into Hadlock was not the purview of the Legislature’s Management Audit Committee, and publicly conducting such an investigation violated the committee’s confidentiality statutes. 
Additionally, Hadlock was not given “fair notice and a reasonable opportunity to obtain counsel and meaningfully respond to the subpoena,” the filing states. 
Natrona County District Attorney Dan Itzen countered in a Thursday filing, arguing that the committee did have the authority to issue a legislative subpoena. 
“Additionally, the subpoena that the Defendant received was valid,” Itzen wrote. “Therefore, the defense’s two main arguments, that the subpoena was not properly issued and that the subpoena was defective, are ineffective.”
Itzen also pointed to the committee’s work, which included several bills that the full Legislature will consider when it convenes next month. 
“In this case, the [Management Audit Committee] subcommittee was auditing the Weston County Clerk 2024 election to determine if any future policy changes should be enacted to prevent similar misconduct from occurring in the future,” the filing states. “This purpose is exemplified by the subcommittee’s final report, which, after listing the subcommittee’s findings of fact, recommends four new policy changes.”
Hadlock knew the purpose of the subpoena and was informed of the consequences for failing to appear pursuant to her subpoena, Itzen wrote, and her absence was not excused. 
The filings also dispute that Hadlock was not given reasonable notice. 
The Legislative Service Office initially contacted Hadlock on Sept. 8, according to the filings. When she said she would not attend, Hadlock was served with a subpoena on Sept. 23. The meeting took place on Sept. 29. 
Hadlock “was put on notice that the subcommittee would likely want to hear her testimony well before the hearing,” Itzen wrote. “Thus, she had ample time to prepare to appear at the hearing and get counsel. Therefore, the defense cannot effectively argue that the defendant was unfairly surprised by this subpoena, and, therefore, the subpoena was invalid.”
Ultimately, whether Hadlock received reasonable notice, Itzen wrote, should be left to the jury, as should “any factual determinations.”
The case also presents “a separation of powers issue,” Itzen wrote, urging the court not to dismiss the case. 
By granting the motion to dismiss, “the Court would be denying the legislature any deference by overstepping into legislative action taken at a legislative hearing,” Itzen wrote. “Judicial involvement would blur the lines between the legislative and judicial branches of government.”
A hearing in the case is set for Jan. 21.
The latest filings come amid Gov. Mark Gordon’s decision to direct the Wyoming Attorney General’s office to seek Hadlock’s removal from office for “her failure to appear for a legislative subpoena and her filing of a false audit report in conjunction with her duties as the Clerk of Weston County,” according to the governor. She does not plan to resign, Semerad told WyoFile.

Mickelson Law Enforcement Center in Pierre, South Dakota, on July 8, 2024. (Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Failure to disclose past misconduct by a law enforcement officer can be enough to overturn a criminal conviction, even if that misconduct was decades old and unrelated to the crime that drew the conviction.
Pennington County State’s Attorney Lara Roetzel said that’s why she asked South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley to convene a task force to standardize the collection, reporting and sharing of information about officer misconduct.
“My goal is that there would be somewhere that prosecutors and law enforcement agencies could go and share information,” said Roetzel, who was named a member of the task force when Jackley announced its creation in a press release last month. 
Details of past misbehavior are often referred to as “Giglio” or “Brady” evidence, named for the two U.S. Supreme Court cases that determined defendants have the right to know about any past dishonesty or ethical lapses by the witnesses against them.
Under those decisions, potentially damning but undisclosed evidence can upend a conviction even if a prosecutor wasn’t aware the evidence existed beforehand.

In an era when police officers regularly move from place to place, Roetzel said, it’s important for prosecutors to be able to keep tabs on which officers have misconduct in their personal histories. There’s no guarantee an officer’s previous employer will pass along information.
Other states also struggle with disclosure, according to a 2022 Minnesota Law Review article. 
Some agencies in some jurisdictions disclose all manner of police misconduct, wrote Rachel Moran, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law. Other agencies may only share and maintain information about dishonesty. 
Misconduct lists across the U.S., she wrote, “vary widely and are almost completely unregulated.”
The issue is a significant concern for South Dakota, Roetzel said, which has welcomed a host of officers moving in from out of state in recent years. 
“I saw several situations where an officer would move to another jurisdiction, and I felt like I needed to make a call” to the prosecutor in the officer’s jurisdiction, Roetzel said.
Attorney general: Disclosure is ‘foundation of our credibility’
Attorney General Jackley sits on the Law Enforcement Officers Standards and Training Commission, which reviews applications for reciprocity by out-of-state officers and considers requests for reinstatement from officers who’ve gotten into trouble and want a second chance.
The commission also acts as a jury when an officer accused of misconduct decides to push back against the allegations to avoid sanction.
The Giglio implications of an officer’s behavior are especially important considerations for the commission, Jackley said. Criminal behavior, unethical conduct, and allegations of racism or sexism could all impact an officer’s reliability on the witness stand, Jackley said, but dishonest conduct such as lying in a police report or search warrant application can be the most damning at a trial.
Honesty and disclosure of all the facts, he said, “is the foundation of our credibility in the courtroom.”

Jackley and Roetzel both said the task force’s creation wasn’t prompted by an overturned conviction, but is preemptive. Every member comes from law enforcement, Jackley said, because “it’s the obligation of law enforcement to disclose.” 
Jackley’s press release on the task force said the group will review the U.S. Supreme Court decisions on disclosure and the further decisions that refined what does or doesn’t constitute evidence of misconduct. After that, the group will “make recommendations on how South Dakota law enforcement agencies can comply with the intent and spirit of the decisions. 
Misdeeds or allegations of misdeeds that may not be enough to threaten an officer’s certification may nonetheless qualify as evidence that must be disclosed to a defense lawyer, he said. 
Jackley said something like a database of misconduct is a possibility, but the first step will be for the group to find a “framework” for what needs to be disclosed and when.
Jackley is running for Congress as a Republican, and is not seeking reelection as the state’s attorney general. He said the decision to create the commission was meant in part to “finish strong” as attorney general by working to improve the justice system for years to come.
Protecting law enforcement
Deuel County Sheriff Cory Borg will serve as board president for the South Dakota Sheriff’s Association for 2026. He’ll serve as the county sheriff representative on the new Giglio task force, alongside other working officer representatives from the Highway Patrol and Vermillion Police Department.
Borg, who’s served as sheriff since 2018, has five deputies to patrol his county, which includes the cities of Clear Lake, Toronto and Brandt. He’s never had to report any misconduct from those deputies, he said, but wouldn’t hesitate to do so. 










Nobody hates a bad officer as much as a good officer.


– Deuel County Sheriff Cory Borg


The public sets a high ethical bar for officers and should, he said, since officers serve as public servants. A “bad apple” officer who grabs headlines or tanks a criminal case with dishonesty damages the public’s perception of the field.
“Nobody hates a bad officer as much as a good officer,” Borg said.
Back in Pennington County, Roetzel said she hopes the task force isn’t viewed as a group that’s out to get police. Attending to ethical issues on the front end, she said, shows people that the state respects the rule of law and those who seek to uphold it.
“This is not anti-law enforcement,” she said. “We want to protect law enforcement.”
The group will hold an organizational meeting later this month, according to Jackley’s office, after which its remaining meeting dates will be set.

Bishop William J. Barber II choked back emotion as he reflected on Wednesday’s untimely death of Renee Nicole Good, the 37-year-old mother who was fatally shot by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis.
“My God, they’re killing mothers. And the grossest image that I’ve seen in a long time — you have an [airbag] covered with blood and baby dolls in the dashboard,” said Barber in recalling his reaction to seeing the videos of Good’s shooting which have been widely circulated on social media.

“The question in this moment is what kind of systems, what kind of attitudes create the atmosphere that can gin somebody up to the point that they would shoot a woman, a mother, at point blank range?” Barber asked.
The Department of Homeland Security and President Donald Trump maintain the ICE agent was acting in “self-defense.”
Barber did not see it that way.
“Because the spirit of hate has been unleashed. If it’s not turned around, it could destroy us all,” he warned.
Barber’s remarks came as a coalition of North Carolina religious and advocacy organizations held a Friday press conference to announce “This Is Our Selma,” a memorial march from Wilson to Raleigh in mid-February.
Barber said North Carolinians are tired of hate and tired of regressive policies that threaten Medicaid, restrict voting rights and instill fear in immigrant communities.
The coalition includes Repairers of the Breach, Indivisible, the North Carolina Council of Churches, the North Carolina Poor People’s Campaign and the Union of Southern Service Workers.
Organizers say the need for a massive march became even more apparent after legislative leaders decided last fall to redraw North Carolina’s congressional districts at the request of President Donald Trump to favor Republicans in the U.S. House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
Critics have argued the new map undermines the voting power of the state’s rural Black voters in the 1st congressional district, which has been represented by Black lawmakers for decades.
The 1st district seat, currently held by U.S. Rep. Don Davis, was North Carolina’s only competitive House seat. The Cook Political Report notes that race is no longer a toss-up. The seat leans Republican.
“That’s the only reason people do all this tricky redistricting and try to block voting rights is because they have considered that they cannot win in a fair fight,” said Barber, calling the new map blatant and racist.
Rev. Dr. Hanna Broome, director of religious affairs for Repairers of the Breach and president of the NC Council of Churches, said the march from Wilson to Raleigh is not only a commemoration of a historic moment, but a continuation.
“156 years after the ratification of the 15th Amendment, we are still pressing forward toward the promise of justice and democracy for all people,” Broome said.
Dennis Gaddy, executive director of the North Carolina Community Success Initiative, said he was moved by a sign in the chapel that read, “We won’t be diluted, we won’t be dismissed.” Gaddy said his nonprofit represents thousands of people who have at one time or another found themselves entangled with the criminal justice system and are turning their lives around.
“And there are people now who are eligible to vote that don’t know it, and they need to be empowered to go to the polls,” Gaddy said. “That’s one of the things we’ll be doing along this movement.”
In-person, early voting for the March 2026 primaries begins Feb. 12, and the group hopes the march will put a spotlight on that opportunity to be heard.
Barber encouraged the group to not speak out against the policies or an administration they oppose, but to speak out boldly in support of policies they would love to see pass including healthcare for all, fully funded public education, and living wages.
“All over the nation, people of goodwill must decide now to stand and push for democracy and a society worth having and then love forward to get it.”

Contemporary paganism is on the rise nationwide — and Vermont’s witches say it’s taken root here as well.

Maggie Byers first felt drawn to paganism during a rough patch in her life. 
Her marriage fell apart during the Covid-19 pandemic, and she began to reevaluate many aspects of herself that she’d taken for granted: her relationships, her body, her career. 
When her mother sent her a video of people reading Tarot cards, she decided to visit a Tarot reader for the first time. The experience went beyond what she could have imagined, as she felt the medium connect her with her departed relatives. 
“I’m driving home thinking, ‘I forgot about spirituality,’” she said. “All of the things that I was working on for myself, it was all grounded in the earth.”
It took another year of research and experimentation for her to identify as pagan, but it now plays an integral role in her life, whether it’s Tarot, manifesting desires through positive thinking, following the moon cycles or sitting side-by-side with her father, a Christian minister, as they both pray. 
In some ways, Americans have become less religious than ever. A decadeslong Pew study found the percentage of Americans with any religious affiliation is dropping, and Vermont in particular has the second-lowest religious affiliation of any state. 
Yet at the same time, there’s been a small but steady rise in the percentage of Americans who identify as contemporary pagans, an umbrella term that includes paganism as well as Wicca, witchcraft and a host of other belief systems. Helen Berger, a researcher at Brandeis University, calls it the “third wave” of interest in paganism after the surge in Wicca in the 1960s and renewed interest in the 1990s. 
It’s harder to say if Vermont is part of that trend, since the absolute numbers are still very small. Pew’s study, for example, reports that only 1% of Vermonters identify as pagan or Wiccan. But interviews with Vermonters who practice these beliefs suggest there is a thriving community of practitioners in the Green Mountain State.
The state’s connection to paganism surged in the 1960s and 1970s, when the back-to-the-land movement drew in migrants with more liberal and alternative beliefs. Doc Bradley, a politics and religion professor at the University of Vermont, said in October that the rise of the counterculture movement in that period prompted a shift away from mainstream religious systems in the Green Mountain State. 
Berger said contemporary pagans tend to be more common in urban environments than rural ones, but Vermont may be an exception to that rule because of its counterculture history. There are “a lot of hippies” in Vermont, she said, who could feel drawn to paganism or witchcraft for its lack of authority structure and practice of alternative healing methods.
Vermonters may also be open to contemporary paganism because of its association with feminism and environmentalism, Berger said. Many branches of it celebrate and even worship nature. 
“People go to Vermont to feel closer to nature,” Berger said. “We’re always in nature, but the concrete makes us feel more distant from it in the city, possibly.”
Today’s contemporary pagans are different from previous generations, Berger said. They’re more likely to practice alone, more likely to connect to their beliefs through online sources and more likely to find their own preferred practices rather than following set paths of study. 
“If you want to become a witch, you go online, and they say, ‘this is what you need to practice,’” Berger said. When she was studying covens in the 1990s, “people made a lot of their own tools, or they would buy them individually. Now you can buy these packages from Walmart.”
That accessibility, Berger said, has made contemporary paganism appealing to people who feel disconnected from the rigidity of other religious traditions. The most common religion remains Christianity, with 45% of Vermont adults identifying as Christians.  
“It’s considered a spirituality, rather than an institutional religion,” she said. “There’s no church, mosque, temple, synagogue to attain. It’s much more open to your own interpretation. People do magic, and they feel it works.”
Finding the light
The winter solstice, which was Dec. 21 last year, is one of the most important holidays in the pagan calendar, Berger said. It represents a celebration of the return of the light, since each day after the solstice will gradually get longer. 
Byers has created her own tradition for her family. Each year, they hang pine cones on a tree with little scraps of paper that represent their wishes for 2026. 
“It’s almost like writing to Santa Claus,” she said. 
Then in February, the deepest part of winter, they burn the pine cones to “release that energy.”
Manifesting is one of many practices that commonly fall under the realm of contemporary paganism, Berger said. Others are as diverse as the pagans and witches who practice them: tarot, spellwork, astrology, using crystals and herbs and worshipping the goddess or other divine figures are some of the most cited. 
For Cassandra, a recent Vermont convert to witchcraft, meditation with herbs and candles is the ritual that has brought her the most peace and spiritual connection in her everyday life. 
“It’s not about clearing your mind of thoughts, as some people will tell you; it is so much more about taking in your senses and regrounding in your body,” said Cassandra, who asked not to use her full name due to concerns about harassment for her beliefs. 
Jillian Kirby, a Burlington-based witch, said her favorite part of witchcraft was the altar she created for her ancestors above her cooking range. The altar has small objects that belonged to each of her deceased loved ones.

Kirby took an indirect path to her identity as a witch. Raised as a Christian churchgoer, she became a “really intense” atheist in her early adulthood. But she found herself missing the “sense of mystery” she found in church services. 
Then she found an online community of atheopagans, atheists who incorporate pagan philosophy and traditions into their lives. Kirby sometimes describes herself as a “placebo witch” and has become an ordained atheopagan cleric. 
“(There are) a lot of things that from the outside would look very specifically like the idea of spell work, but without any implication of there being a spiritual or other worldly power at work in those things,” she said. 
Kirby said online spaces have allowed many people to discover paganism or witchcraft, or their own specific niche within those beliefs, in a way that wasn’t as easy in the pre-internet era. 
“There were so many people who were sort of existing and had their own thoughts and their own practices and maybe some little thing here or there,” she said. “And then social media comes. Then people start connecting via the internet, and you find all these other people in your immediate community who are doing these weird little things that you’re into, and then they’re doing other things. And you sort of can expand your practice.” 
Byers said she was surprised to learn there were so many other Vermont witches. Although she occasionally connects with other witches on social media, she hasn’t quite gotten around to attending a local witches meetup in White River Junction. 
“It’s a busy life, and it’s hard to get out,” she said. “So I haven’t made that a priority yet.”
Berger said she’s also encountered witches who view their practice through a more symbolic lens. 
“You could still have the experiences, but not believe in it in a divine or another world way, but you’re having an experience, and those experiences are meaningful,” she said. 
Vermont may have a low rate of religious affiliation, but data from the Pew Religious Survey suggests some Vermonters without a specific religious affiliation still have spiritual views. While only 54% of Vermonters identify as part of a named religion, 81% said they believed in a soul or spirit, and 70% said they believe in something spiritual beyond the natural world. 
“They still have these experiences, feelings, needs,” Berger said. “And one way in which this need is being met is witchcraft, the metaphysical religions and being in nature.” 
Witch hunts, old and new
Modern-day contemporary paganism has few ties to the accusations of witchcraft that led to witch hunts and killings in colonial New England. Amanda Van Epps, the Vermont commissioner on women and a disability advocate, said the historical label of “witch” had more to do with who was viewed as an outsider than the person’s actual beliefs and practices. 
“The so-called ‘witch’ was really just a linguistic label signaling that someone had been singled out by their community, not so much a reflection of the practices or the beliefs of people who identify as witches today,” she said. “And I would say ironically, it wasn’t the accused who were hysterical, but rather society itself.”
Yet there have been women who describe themselves as witches as a way of reclaiming their power in a patriarchal system, she said. 
From the first wave of interest in contemporary paganism in the 1960s, the movement has been connected to feminism and the feminine divine, Berger said. 
“It is drawing in women and particularly girls because of empowerment, this sense of empowerment,” she said. 
She’s also observed a higher-than-average rate of people in the LGBTQ+ community identifying as contemporary pagans. 
“There is a hetero-centralism within Wicca,” she said. “But from the beginning, the groups that were forming were very open to alternatives, which meant alternative lifestyles and alternatives for whom you might love or create a family with. So all along there have been more gay, more trans people within paganism than in the general population.”
There’s been a long history of discrimination against contemporary pagans, stemming in part from a mistaken connection between paganism and Satanism. Van Eps said there was a certain irony to the fact that modern-day practitioners face the same accusations that victims of historic witch hunts did, even though they have no documented connection to each other. 
“Unfortunately for those who identify as a witch today, or are trying to reclaim their femininity, they may be targeted just because of the word ‘witch,’” even though their ideology is “completely different” than what they’re being accused of, Van Eps said. 
Berger said some witches in the past have lost custody of their kids because their ex-spouse argued they were an “unfit parent.” In other instances, public rituals have been disrupted or called out by Christian ministers or other religious figures as “evil.” 
The stigma continues, even in Vermont. One business owner who sells witchcraft-related products pulled out of an interview with VTDigger because, she said via email, she’s received harassing phone calls accusing her of Satanism. 
Kirby recalled taking out a book from the library as a child that happened to contain a description of palm readings. Her devout Christian grandmother made her return the book. 
“It took me a long time to not feel like I had to pretend I was just still Christian with my very intensely religious family,” she said. 
It was becoming a parent that made her realize she needed to make a more conscious decision to openly embrace her beliefs. 
“Really purposely crafting that for my kid has really grounded me in like, ‘No, this is really the choice I’m making, and it’s a completely valid choice,’” she said. 
Byers said she would study a person at first to get a sense of whether they would object to her beliefs before opening up to them about it. She also tries to find common ground with people from other religions by finding the overarching principles of love and kindness. 
“The same ideas of like, giving gratitude, forgiving yourself, being humble — it’s all the same context, just different words,” she said. 
At the same time, Vermont’s witches and pagans are able to be critical of what they see as missteps within their own movement. Cassandra said she’s cautious about avoiding “closed practices,” or rituals and beliefs that are tied to specific marginalized groups. She gave the example of sage burning or smudging, which is associated with Indigenous tribes.
“The most important thing would be to be respectful and do your homework, because a connection with witchcraft is is about your own interpretation, true, but it’s best to approach that interpretation from a respectful standpoint of people who have been practicing these spells, festivities, what have you for thousands of years,” she said. 
Byers said she tries to avoid any practice that could interfere with another person’s free will, like hexing someone. 
“That’s just bad juju,” she said. 
To her, witchcraft is more of an internal practice that has allowed her to see life in a new day. She said it has helped her quell her fear of dying and leaving people behind. 
“I have that type of faith that whatever is meant to be will happen, and that somebody will come in and take care of my kids, or people will move on and grieve as they need to,” Byers said. “So it really took away fear of dying and leaving people behind and also taking away the fear of living my life.”

This old saying comes to mind as the State of Michigan, now going back decades, has threatened to privatize or what I call the “profitization” of public community-based behavioral health, better known to many as mental health and addiction services.
These vital community resources have been provided at the local level going back to President John F. Kennedy’s administration and are desperately needed to bring a semblance of help and human decency to individuals and their families who are combating serious mental illness, intellectual and developmental disabilities and substance use disorders.
Using the euphemism of “bidding out or redesigning the system of care” the state under the direction of the Department of Health and Human Services, going back to Governor Engler’s administration, have attempted to give the insurance companies control of billions of our tax dollars to “manage” these services.
The courts slowed down the state’s action and a recent court pronouncement resulted in a “kissing your sister ruling,” as a long-time watcher said, not fully satisfying either the department or advocates fighting the state move.
Michigan court rules state’s mental health procurement plan violates law

The ball appears to be back in Governor  Whitmer and State Department of Health and Human Services Director Hertel’s hands on how they wish to proceed.
They should follow the railway warning: Stop, look and listen.
Those advocating for the “redesign” believe it will modernize the system of care and provide better outcomes than the current system. Those advocating for the change provide no evidence or data that the changes will add any additional value or make a difference to persons in need and their families’ lives.
To the contrary these proposed changes would result in a loss of local control, increase administrative costs, replace a publicly managed care system that has a 2% overhead with a privately managed profit care system that has up to a 20% overhead.
In a strongly worded open letter to Michigan’s Governor and the State Legislature, the National Alliance of Mental Illness (NAMI-MI) made it abundantly clear they oppose the “redesign” process saying: “The RFP/bid out process represents a significant and damaging shift in the structure and delivery of behavioral health services in our state with far-reaching harm to the ability of Michiganders to receive needed mental health care and to the locally driven system upon which 300,000 Michiganders (and the 1 million family members) have come to rely.”
The Community Mental Health Association of Michigan which is opposed to the redesign process says it provides, “serious risks without addressing the system’s core challenges.”  The organization goes on to say, “Other states that have pursued similar restructuring have experienced higher costs, workforce losses, fragmented services and diminished access for those most in need. Michigan must not repeat those mistakes.”
Debbie Stabenow, who has spent her professional career of over a half century serving as a county commissioner, state Representative, state Senator, U.S. House member and U.S. senator, has been a staunch advocate and supporter of a strong community based public mental health system. She has been a vocal critic of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services plan to privatize the state’s public mental health system.
Stabenow retired from the U.S. Senate in January 2025 but has continued to voice her opposition against the Whitmer’s administration’s effort to the state’s proposal since it was introduced in 2024.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Tenacious Debbie has ferociously argued that the state’s privatization proposal would be detrimental to patients and the public system as a whole by increasing costs, decreasing access, reduce transparency and accountability and concluded saying that Michigan’s mental health system is in need of greater public investment — not being put up for private management.
The former senator has earned the respect and admiration of  behavioral health consumers, their families and community based providers across Michigan and deserves to be listened to, and more importantly, followed.
Wishful thinking by state government is neither a strategy nor a plan. Consumers and their families fear these changes and don’t believe the state with their mantra, “We are from the government and we are here to help you.”
In her final year in office Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the Legislature must pull together to enhance and improve public mental health access and integration of care in the new year. “Profitizing” it by turning it over to profit-driven insurance companies is not the answer.
Period- full stop!
This is not a side issue that impacts “those people.” Mental health and substance use disorders impact every ZIP code and one in four people across this great nation of ours. Dr. Vivek Murthy, former U.S. Surgeon General, says the mental health crisis is the biggest health concern facing the country because it impacts so many people and different facets of life.
This fact was recently bought home by the death of the iconic actor and film producer, Rob Reiner, and his wife Michelle, by their son Nick Reiner, who has been charged with their murders. Nick has struggled with mental health and addiction issues since his adolescence.
We need to listen to those most directly impacted by these threatened changes. There is a palpable fear among parents, consumers and advocates that the public mental health safety net will be ripped to shreds. Family members worry about losing long-term relationships with trusted providers and new rules that limit service. Given the struggles to get what they have, their worries are not without merit.
Critics say Michigan’s plan to open mental health contracts to bidding will outsource local care

The voices of county sheriffs, boards of county commissioners, police officer associations, local hospitals, the Community Mental Health Association of Michigan, National Alliance of Mental Illness, Michigan Mental Health Association and other advocacy organizations are opposing this false promise that would place profits before people.
The so called “redesign” is not truly about solutions to the real issues facing a system of care that does need additional support and sensible consumer-focused reforms. We must do better by serving not profiting from persons with behavioral health needs.
Here’s how we continue the pursuit of an integrated health care system that maximizes public resources, is consumer and community-focused and is data-driven and evidence-based:

Eliminate the separation of physical health care services from behavioral health care. Integrate care at the consumer level where no person is turned away. Treat the whole person; the mind is connected to the body;
Shut down services that continually abuse taxpayers’ resources while enriching themselves at the expense of those most vulnerable;
Create crisis intervention teams for law enforcement agencies throughout the state. Such partnerships between law enforcement and behavioral health care providers considerably improve care while reducing police officer injuries and costs when responding to mental health crisis calls. Sadly, our jails and prisons have become 21st-century psychiatric holding cells;
Significantly step up audits on Medicare/Medicaid providers to identify and prevent fraud and abuse;
Pay livable wages to direct-care staff. Stop the rhetoric about “supporting ‘essential’ workers” while paying invaluable staffers a pittance, often with no benefits.
Fund advocacy organizations adequately to enable them to hold the system accountable. Without their watchdog eyes and ears the system will slip off track with devastating consequences to people’s lives;
End the stigma of mental illness. Channel funds toward researching the causes of serious mental illness and developing responses to these disorders;
Utilize digital technologies and artificial intelligence which have the potential to profoundly impact behavioral health services. We need to use predictive analytics to design programs that help people engage with behavioral health services. Smart analytics could help educate people about behavioral health services;
Continue insurance reimbursement for virtual mental health services after the COVID-19 crisis subsides. It works;
Address shortages of certain specialty providers, including psychiatrists as well as eating disorder and autism specialists;
Fund local community mental health agencies to work with schools to address psychosocial issues students face that were exacerbated by the pandemic;
Create partnerships between behavioral health services and employers to boost awareness, acceptance, prevention and recovery within the workplace;
Move nonviolent persons with serious mental health issues currently in our prison system to appropriate behavioral health programs;
Hold hospitals accountable for serving people with serious mental illness. Michigan needs to get serious about using all the tools at its disposal, including certificates of need, licensing and tax policy forcing hospitals to accept public money to serve patients. Finding a psychiatric bed for someone with serious mental illness can often feel like their name is Mary or Joseph and it is Dec. 24 in Bethlehem. It is unconscionable that people with mental illness in need of hospital settings are denied service.

Decisions that benefit consumers and taxpayers instead of the “system” will lead us to a path that adds value and makes a difference. Without a shift in emphasis from profit to quality care, future policymakers will be confronted with an unfathomable mess to clean up.
Let’s work together to enhance care, support and opportunities for strangers, friends and family members with an illness or disability. A friend with cerebral palsy once called me a TAB: temporarily able-bodied. He explained that we are all one life-changing event away from needing some level of assistance. There, but for the grace of God, go I.
Everything we do should create a life of dignity and self-determination for our fellow citizens. We ought to proceed as though our actions will impact someone’s mother, father, sister, brother or son or daughter – because ultimately it will.
Let’s move forward, getting past the turf protection and place our focus on integrating care for our families and neighbors in need of quality mental health and substance use services.
People over profits.

Kelly Armstrong on Friday touted the success of the state’s application for federal Rural Health Transformation Program funding, which landed one of the largest per-capita awards in the nation.
North Dakota received $199 million for the first year of the five-year grant.
Congress set aside $50 billion for the program in its reconciliation bill last year as a way to offset losses rural states will incur due to Medicaid cuts.
The funding, awarded to North Dakota in late December, is almost double the minimum funding available to states this year.
Alaska, Montana, Oklahoma crack top five in first rural hospital funding allocation

The funding amounts to roughly $561 per North Dakota resident, according to an analysis by policy research organization KFF. Only six states received larger per-capita awards. The average grant amount was about $200 million per state.
States are guaranteed at least $500 million over the five-year period, but could receive more depending on the strength of their applications and other factors. 
Hoeven, a Republican, said his goal is for North Dakota to receive the maximum possible award of $1 billion.
He pointed to North Dakota’s existing hospital and communications infrastructure as factors that set its application apart.
The state has a very short window to get the money out into the hands of communities. North Dakota has until the end of September 2026 to obligate the funding, and until September 2027 to spend it.
The state Department of Health and Human Services is hiring a liaison to help tribal communities apply for the federal funding. Tribes’ unique legal status means their applications for grant money may have different requirements, Armstrong said. 
“We want to make sure that they have access to somebody on our staff that helps them do that and gives them the best chance of success,” the Republican said.
State lawmakers will convene for a special legislative session later this month to authorize the spending of the grant money.
North Dakota receives $199 million in federal grant for rural health care

A committee of lawmakers tasked with guiding the state’s application for Rural Health Transformation Program funding will meet Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss the $200 million award and to discuss bill drafts for the special session.
While Armstrong called the special session to allocate the federal funding, lawmakers could also consider legislation related to other issues.
Legislative Management will meet on Wednesday to discuss the scope of the session.
Legislators will consider four policy bills that the state pledged to adopt in its Rural Health Transformation Program application. They would require schools to participate in a federal fitness test, require ongoing nutrition education for doctors, have North Dakota join a physician assistant licensure compact and to expand the services pharmacists are authorized to provide.
The federal government indicated that states with these policies would get larger grant awards.

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Democratic leaders in the Washington state Legislature said Friday they have no plans to hold hearings on two conservative-backed initiatives focused on parental rights of students in public schools and banning transgender athletes from playing girls’ sports.
Both Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, and House Speaker Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma, staked out this position in remarks to reporters. It creates a high likelihood that both of the initiatives will go before Washington voters on midterm ballots this November.
“I’m certain that we will not be passing either of those initiatives,” Pedersen said. “They’ll be up to the voters to decide.”
The political committee Let’s Go Washington said it turned in more than 400,000 signatures for each of the two initiatives last week. Brian Heywood, the hedge fund manager who leads the group, urged lawmakers to reconsider holding hearings. 
“Not only would this be a blatant slap in the face to the hundreds of thousands of Democrat, Independent, and Republican voters who support the measures, it would be a clear sign that they don’t care about the abuses to children, families, and female athletes taking place in the state,” Heywood said in a statement.
Gov. Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, said he hasn’t read the initiatives but “it’d be the first time I ever supported a Bill Heywood initiative,” making an apparent flub of Heywood’s first name.
“If what you’re hearing is the Legislature saying it should go to the voters for a vote, I tend in general, as a general matter, I don’t have a problem,” he told reporters Friday.
The vows from legislative Democrats don’t come as a surprise. 
The parental rights measure would immediately undo a new state law Democrats fought to pass last year. That law rewrote a Let’s Go Washington initiative known as the parental “bill of rights” that lawmakers passed in 2024.
IL26-001 would repeal the changes made to the 2024 initiative by House Bill 1296, one of the most controversial bills passed in the 2025 legislative session. Democrats said the rewrite was necessary to clarify the earlier Heywood-backed initiative, which sought to codify rights for parents of public school students under age 18. 
The goal of the 2024 initiative was to ensure parents have easy access to school materials, their child’s medical records and immediate notification if a child is involved in a crime. One of the major changes in last year’s legislation removed parental access to medical records.
IL26-638 looks to block transgender girls from competing in girls’ sports.
Even though Ferguson said he wasn’t an expert on the initiatives, he said, “We live in a world right now where trans kids are going through a lot.”
“I want to support trans kids,” he said. 
Ferguson also had a brief but tense exchange with conservative commentator Brandi Kruse, who asked about his position on the initiative, given his daughter competes in school sports. The governor responded by suggesting Kruse has an “obsession with trans kids.”
Both measures appear to have enough signatures to move forward to the Legislature, then to voters in November. But the secretary of state’s office still needs to certify the initiatives before they can be considered. That’ll likely take several weeks. 
Lawmakers technically have three options with the citizen initiatives. They can approve them and make them law, though that won’t happen in this case. They can send them to the ballot for voters to decide, the presumed outcome here. Or they could pass an alternative to an initiative, leaving it up for voters to weigh in on both.

(Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)President Donald Trump’s administration contracted last month with The GEO Group to operate a dormant prison in Hudson as an immigrant detention center for at least six months, according to documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado.
The documents, released by the ACLU on Thursday after a Freedom of Information Act request, are the clearest indication yet that federal immigration authorities have prioritized reopening the facility in Hudson, located about 30 miles northeast of Denver, as they ramp up detention capacity in Colorado in pursuit of Trump’s mass deportation plans.
The dormant Big Horn Correctional Facility, formerly known as the Hudson Correctional Facility, is a 1,200-bed prison that operated for a span of just five years after its 2009 opening. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement contract for “comprehensive detention services” at the facility was issued to The GEO Group on Dec. 1, 2025, but the amount and terms of the contract are redacted in the documents.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to inquiries about the released documents or when the Hudson facility might reopen. The documents also contain a previous $39 million contract for The GEO Group to operate the facility for the six-month period beginning in April of last year, but the prison remained empty.
ACLU advocates criticized the government’s heavy redactions of the released documents, with Tim Macdonald, the ACLU of Colorado’s legal director, demanding “more transparency into how (ICE officials) plan to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to imprison more people who have not been convicted of any crime.”
In his second term, Trump has pledged to carry out the “largest domestic deportation operation in American history,” aiming to remove all of the estimated 12 million immigrants in the country without permanent legal status, regardless of how long they have been in the country, the legal status of their family members or whether they have criminal records.
Colorado is currently home to only one ICE detention center, an Aurora facility also operated by The GEO Group. The Hudson facility is one of six potential new sites for ICE detention under consideration in Colorado, a list that also includes the dormant Huerfano County Correctional Center in Walsenburg and the Southern Ute Indian Adult Detention Center in Ignacio. The three new facilities would expand ICE’s Colorado footprint by a total of 2,560 additional beds, tripling its detention capacity in the state.
The latest records obtained by the ACLU also contain a document known as a “Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition,” or JOFOC, which is required when the federal government awards a contract without a competitive bidding process — but the 98-page file is completely redacted.
In August, following the passage of $45 billion in funding for expanded immigration detention in Republicans’ spending and tax cut law, GEO Group chairman George Zoley spoke during an earnings call about the “attractive opportunity for investors” presented by “the unprecedented growth opportunities we anticipate will materialize over the balance of this year and next year.”
“The documents we received from ICE fail to answer fundamental questions about the agency’s planned expansion for the Denver field office,” Scott Medlock, a senior staff attorney with the Colorado ACLU, said in a statement. “With Congress allocating unprecedented resources and funding to ICE and DHS, the public deserves to know how the federal government intends to use this infusion of money.”

(Julia Goldberg/SourceNM)With the start of 2026, expect to see a ramp-up toward New Mexico’s June 2 primary and, of course, the Nov. 3 midterms. Source NM will be both rounding up and digging into the election cycle. For now, here’s an overview of campaign activity in the first week of the year.
Signature scamper
More than a dozen candidates have announced campaigns for New Mexico’s top executive office in the 2026 election, as current Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, is term-limited from running again. 
In order to appear on the ballot, candidates running with either of the state’s major Democratic or Republican parties must collect a little more than 2,000 signatures from members of their political parties and submit them to the Secretary of State by a Feb. 3 deadline, according to state law. 
The secretary of state’s office will publish the petition forms for minor party and independent candidates, including the required number of signatures, by March 31. Those candidates have until June 25 to file for candidacy, since they do not participate in the primary elections. 
The law requires that signatures for the major party candidates represent 2% of registered voters in the party who voted in the last gubernatorial primary election. For Democrats that number is 2,505 and for Republican candidates that’s 2,351 signatures, according to the state’s election information guide. 
Candidates have until the deadline to collect signatures, and then submit that along with other paperwork to the Secretary of State, according to Alex Curtas, a spokesperson for the office.
“At this point no one is officially a candidate for anything,” Curtas told Source NM in an email. “People have made announcements and ‘declared’ they are running, but no one is officially running until the paperwork is submitted and verified/accepted by our office on candidate filing day.”
Four candidates have reported exceeding the signature counts in statements from their campaigns. They include Democratic candidates Deb Haaland, the former Secretary of the Interior and U.S. congresswoman, who reported exceeding the minimum within 24 hours in October; and Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman, who has gathered more than 8,000 signatures, his campaign spokesperson told Source NM on Friday.
Republican candidates Gregg Hull, the mayor of Rio Rancho; and recent entry to the race Duke Rodriguez, a cannabis businessman and former cabinet secretary under former Gov. Gary Johnson, also said they’ve met the threshold. 
Rodriguez said in a news release this week he had collected more than 6,000 signatures.
“This wasn’t about checking a box. It was about earning trust,” Rodriguez said in a statement. “Every signature represents a real person who took time to participate, engage, and make their voice heard. That matters.”
 
New entries


While no campaign will be official until the Feb. 3 filing day, candidates are still announcing their entries into the race.
James “Jim” Ellis, a former Public Regulation Commissioner appointed by Lujan Grisham in 2023, who served until 2024, unveiled his website earlier this week, saying his platform is building “affordability, opportunity, and trust in government.” An emailed request for comment was not returned by deadline.
Ellis is the fourth candidate to seek the Republican nomination, with a field that includes Hull, Rodriguez and Sen. Steve Lanier (R-Aztec). Lanier has served in the state senate since his election in 2024, and served one term as a San Juan County commissioner. 
Dem contenders report additional events, endorsements
Haaland opened the new year with a donation of more than 350 books Friday to the Albuquerque-based literacy nonprofit Read to Me!
“By investing in education we invest in New Mexico’s future. As governor, I’ll prioritize making sure kids can read early on day one,” she said in a social media post.
Also this week, Bregman received the endorsement of Ohkay Owingeh, his third tribal endorsement.
Ohkay Owingeh Governor Benny J. Lujan said in a Jan. 5 statement that Bregman “respects our sovereignty and understands the realities facing our community,”  in the official endorsement. 
“He listens, he follows through, and he approaches tribal nations as partners not afterthoughts. That distinction matters,” Lujan said.
Bregman celebrated the endorsement in a statement. 
“I’m deeply honored by the trust Ohkay Owingeh has placed in me,” Bregman said. “For decades, I’ve stood alongside tribal governments in the fight for sovereignty and fairness. As governor, I will make sure tribal nations have a real partner in the Governor’s Office and a real voice in state government.”
Bregman also took to social media at the end of 2025 with what he called an “Obama-inspired favorites list” that included items such as his favorite musician and beer (Luke Combs and Coors).
What’s in a name
The Santa Fe County Clerk’s Office on Friday issued a news release reminding candidates of an approaching deadline for their own voter registrations. Once the Secretary of State issues the official election proclamation on Jan. 26, under state law anyone interested in running for office will be unable to make any changes to their names, addresses or political party affiliations. Those rules do not apply to anyone not running for office.

(Screenshot/YouTube, Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources)Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman is no longer demanding a resignation from the chair of the state’s wildlife management board while the AG’s office analyzes a provision in state law that’s key to the dispute.
An earlier interpretation by the AG’s office has raised hackles among hunters and anglers across the state who say it runs afoul of how a license exemption for hunting or fishing on one’s own farmland has long been understood and enforced.
Sen. Gary Boswell (LRC Public Information)
The AG’s office is pausing its demand that Kentucky Fish and Wildlife Commission Chair Chuck Meade immediately resign after receiving a request from state Sen. Gary Boswell for an attorney general’s opinion, said Aaron Silletto, the AG’s executive director of the Office of Civil and Environmental Law, in a Jan. 8 letter to Meade’s attorney. 
Boswell, R-Owensboro, is asking if an exemption in state law that allows the “resident owner of farmlands” to hunt and fish on that land without having to buy a Kentucky hunting or fishing license only applies if someone lives on that farmland. 
“In light of this request, the office withdraws its request that your client resign immediately from his position on the Fish and Wildlife Resources Commission; we will revisit this matter after the publication of the Opinion of the Attorney General requested by Sen. Boswell,” Silletto wrote to Meade’s attorney. “We will be in touch with you regarding the opinion once it is published.” 
The Lantern previously reported Silletto in a December letter demanded Meade resign from the commission because he did not have the required five years worth of hunting and fishing licenses to be eligible to serve on the commission. Silletto wrote the resignation demand resulted from an investigation spurred by a citizen’s complaint the office received in October. Silletto did not name who filed the complaint.
Meade responded, citing the exemption for farmland owners and saying that he had met the legal requirements to serve on the commission by hunting on his family’s Lawrence County farm every year since 2008. Silletto responded that because he did not live on the farm, Meade did not qualify for the license exemption. 
Hunters and anglers say the exemption has historically meant one had to be a resident of Kentucky and own the farmland with no requirement to reside on the land.
Bill Repasky, an attorney for Meade, echoed that argument in a Dec. 31 letter addressed to Silletto responding to the resignation demand. Repasky wrote Silletto’s interpretation of the exemption was in “stark opposition to working knowledge held by our many public officials charged with enforcing Kentucky’s game and fish laws.” 
In a Friday statement to the Lantern, Repasky said the attorney general’s decision to “revisit his earlier position” was welcomed. 
“We are confident this controversy will be favorably resolved in the near future. In the interim, Chuck Meade looks forward to continuing his work as the representative of District 7 and to advocating for all the sportsmen and women of our commonwealth as chairman of the Kentucky Fish and Game Commission,” Repasky said. 
Commission members oversee the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources’s budget consisting of tens of millions of dollars in hunting and fishing license fees, boat registration fees and federal grants. The commission also implements and changes hunting and fishing regulations. 
State law also directs the commission to keep a “watchful eye” over the department, and the commission controls the employment of the department’s head executive, Commissioner Rich Storm. 
The concern among sportspeople
Jim Strader, the host of a Kentucky radio show about hunting and fishing, during an episode earlier this month said he’s been “flooded with calls” about the news of Silletto’s resignation demand and what the interpretation of the exemption in the letter could mean for hunters and anglers.
Jim Strader posing with a fish. (Provided)
Strader in a Lantern interview gave a hypothetical example of someone who builds a farm pond on their private property and pays to stock it with fish. The Kentucky Department of Fish and WIldlife Resources no longer stocks private recreational ponds. 
“Why should they have to buy a license?” Strader said, adding that he generally encourages people to purchase licenses to support wildlife management. 
The League of Kentucky Sportsmen, representing thousands of hunters across the state, in a late December press release called on the Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources to clarify the interpretation of the license exemption because “tens of thousands of Kentucky sportsmen could be affected” by it. 
David Casey, the former assistant director of law enforcement at the Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources, worked 24 years at the department and retired in 2009. 
He told the Lantern he recalls no instances of hunters or anglers being cited by game wardens for hunting and fishing on their own farmland without a license. 
“It’s always been in my time with the department, if you own the land and live in the state of Kentucky, you can hunt and fish on that property without a license,” Casey said. 
Casey said the farmland exemption did come into question if someone who lived outside of Kentucky was hunting or fishing on Kentucky farmland the person owned without a license. That out-of-state hunter or angler would thereby be violating state law because the person did not have a specific non-resident license. 
Casey believed Silletto’s interpretation of the exemption “would affect so many people.”  
“Everybody that lives in Louisville, Lexington, all the metropolitan areas, all your doctors and lawyers and professional people that own land that they have to hunt on probably don’t live on it,” Casey said. 
Casey said the way he understood the exemption, the department did not want to charge hunters and anglers a licensing fee for using private land they may also be managing for wildlife, timber and other resources.

Lisa Jackson, a spokesperson for the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources, said in a Jan. 6 statement the department’s chief executive, Commissioner Rich Storm, “supports allowing bona fide resident owners of farmlands to hunt and fish on their own farmlands.” 
“Enforcement of the landowner exemption has likely varied over the decades. Establishing a definition of ‘resident owners of farmlands’ through legislative action could provide beneficial clarity,” Jackson said in her statement. “To those landowners who are not required by law to purchase a license or permit but choose to do so to support conservation efforts in Kentucky, Commissioner Storm extends his sincere thanks.” 
Jackson emphasized in her statement that wildlife is a “public trust for all citizens and is managed for the public benefit” and that the department is primarily funded through license and permit sales, alongside other fees and grants. 
Boswell in a Lantern interview on Friday said his request for a formal opinion from the attorney general has less to do with Meade’s standing on the commission and more to do with “whether thousands of hunters are violating the law.”

“I don’t think the legislature wants to get involved in this issue. I don’t want to get involved in it. We might have to,” Boswell said.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota prosecutors are asking the public for evidence in the killing of a 37-year-old Minneapolis woman by an ICE agent on Wednesday after the Trump administration froze local law enforcement out of the investigation.
“Every moment in these cases is precious,” said Attorney General Keith Ellison at a news conference in Minneapolis on Friday. “If you have information bearing on the outcome of this matter in any way, please share it.”
The Attorney General’s Office and the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office set up a portal for people to submit photos, videos and other evidence they think may help prosecutors understand the case and the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension will catalogue the submissions.
The BCA typically investigates police shootings and was on the scene at Portland Avenue near 34th Street collecting evidence after an ICE officer, who has been identified as Jonathan Ross, shot and killed Renee Nicole Good in her Honda Pilot.
But on Thursday, the agency announced the U.S. Attorney’s Office had made the unusual decision that the FBI would be the sole investigative agency, effectively freezing out local law enforcement.
“Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands,” BCA superintendent Drew Evans said. “As a result, the BCA has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation.”
Gov. Tim Walz and other state Democrats have expressed doubt that the public could trust the results of an investigation conducted solely by the federal government.
“Now that Minnesota has been taken out of the investigation, it feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome,” Walz said.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said at a Thursday news conference that local officials “have not been cut out. They don’t have any jurisdiction in this investigation.”
The standoff over jurisdiction adds to a contentious fight between state leaders and the Trump administration over fraud in state social service programs and a surge of thousands of federal agents and officers in what the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is calling its largest operation ever.
Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty emphasized that local officials have the authority to both investigate the shooting and potentially bring criminal charges based on the evidence.
“We do have jurisdiction,” Moriarty said. “We cannot make any decision, however, if there is not evidence submitted to our office.”
Moriarty said the FBI has possession of key evidence, including Good’s car and the shell casings from the officer’s gun. She also acknowledged they have really no access to federal law enforcement officers for interviews.
She said she does not have concerns about the integrity of the FBI, but rather that they won’t turn over their findings for state prosecutors to review.
“In the past, the FBI has invited us to see a high level overview of their investigation, but we were prohibited from seeing the entire investigation or talking about what we saw,” Moriarty said.
Prosecutions of federal law enforcement officers are also complicated by the fact that they have immunity from state prosecution for carrying out their duties.
But legal experts emphasize that immunity does not extend to officers who use unreasonable and excessive force.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2026-01-09 20:36:53+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,New report: Gas utilities spent record amount replacing leaky pipes in 2024,Jordan Wolman,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/energy/new-report-gas-utilities-spent-record-amount-replacing-leaky-pipes-in-2024/,The latest data on utilities’ work to replace leaky pipes paints an even more damning picture of GSEP as costs balloon with few additional results — driving up ratepayer bills — and places recent reform efforts into greater context.,"GAS UTILITIES IN MASSACHUSETTS spent a record amount of money in 2024 replacing leaky pipes through the state’s Gas System Enhancement Program, according to a newly released report from regulators, even as the actual miles of replaced pipes remained stubbornly flat since the program’s inception a decade ago. 
The Department of Public Utilities, in its annual report to lawmakers on the state’s natural gas pipe system, found that the gas companies collectively spent $814.4 million to replace about 266 miles of leak-prone pipes. That’s by far the most the utilities ever spent since GSEP was created in 2014 and a nearly 40 percent increase in what was spent the year prior — despite the fact that the utilities replaced slightly fewer miles of leak-prone pipe than in 2023. 
“The [utilities] have spent more money per mile, with the progress at remediating leak-prone pipe occurring at a pace that is largely unchanged from when the GSEP program was first initiated,” DPU said in its report. 
The latest data on utilities’ work to replace leaky pipes, which emit the potent greenhouse gas of methane into the atmosphere, paints an even more damning picture of GSEP as costs balloon with few additional results — driving up ratepayer bills — and places recent reform efforts into greater context. 
“We’ve just seen an absolute explosion in the costs of this program, and it appears to be far beyond inflation,” said Kyle Murray, Massachusetts program director at Acadia Center, an environmental research and advocacy nonprofit. 
Massachusetts established GSEP in 2014 with the best of intentions: to create an incentive for utilities to quickly fix leaks across the state’s aging 21,000 miles of natural gas pipes and to provide Bay Staters who heat their homes and cook with gas a safer system and one that minimizes emissions.  
Since then, though, the program has been beset by runaway costs and contention over how the state squares the circle of justifying hundreds of millions of dollars each year in investments into a gas system that Massachusetts is at the same time trying to cut off — and rather quickly.  
The utilities have spent $6.2 billion on new gas pipes through GSEP, and spending through the program has increased by an average of 12 percent each year since 2015, according to the attorney general’s office, amid soaring material and labor costs. GSEP costs account for 8 to 11 percent of ratepayers’ monthly bills, the AG says. 
The DPU stepped in last year to make key changes to address the climbing costs, including cutting how much utilities can recover from ratepayers through GSEP and incentivizing repairing lines instead of replacing them.  
That DPU order came after negotiations over GSEP reforms proved to be a sticking point in the State House as lawmakers hammered out the 2024 climate bill. 
State officials project the DPU order will reduce bills as Beacon Hill seeks to lower the cost of energy in Massachusetts, home to the country’s third-highest residential electricity prices. Regulators launched an investigation late last year at the urging of Gov. Maura Healey to review all charges on gas and electric bills. 
Public outrage last winter over high ratepayer bills fueled Healey’s energy affordability bill currently under consideration in the Legislature. That has prompted fierce debate over what’s driven the rising costs, with some lawmakers even pushing to weaken the state’s 2030 climate commitments to halve greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 levels. 
The GSEP issues have exposed the tough choices facing Beacon Hill as it manages an energy transition: continue to spend money on an expensive gas system, spreading out the costs over fewer people as households switch to electric, or begin to retire the network of pipes altogether in favor of technologies like geothermal and electric heat pumps — the latter of which entails up-front costs but promises savings down the line. 
“If you do business as usual here, you’re going to keep throwing money at a system that is becoming antiquated,” Murray said. “And we’re going to stick an ever-declining ratebase with these costs, and then you are going to end up in an even greater affordability crisis. We’re going to be stuck with stranded assets if we don’t change the way we fundamentally do business here.” 
Total gas leaks in the state have been cut in half since 2014, according to DPU’s report, with just over 9,000 pending leaks at the end of 2024, a nearly 15 percent decrease from the year prior.  
But even then, the worst of the leaks, which require the most immediate action and represent an “existing or probable hazard,” increased from 37 to 40 from 2023 to 2024, as utilities battle the “Whack-a-Mole” of new leaks that emerge.  
National Grid, the utility that operates the most miles of natural gas pipes in the state, was responsible for all 40 of these leaks not yet fixed at the end of 2024.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/CorrodedNaturalGasPipelineInspection-edited-1.png?fit=1024%2C767&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-09 15:58:32.466950

A ‘physical disturbance’ involving three incarcerated people occurred on Wednesday afternoon at Oshkosh Correctional Institution, Oshkosh police said in a statement. The department said it is investigating a death that occurred after the disturbance. 
Beth Hardtke, communications director for the Wisconsin Department of Corrections, told the Examiner that Teng Vang, 43, died Thursday at a hospital. He was assigned to Oshkosh Correctional Institution. 
Police said a 43 year-old incarcerated person who assaulted another incarcerated person was secured by prison staff. He experienced a medical emergency and was transported to a local hospital. 
Hardtke wrote that the Oshkosh Police Department is investigating the death and the Department of Corrections is fully cooperating with the investigation.
Vang was found guilty of crimes including attempted first-degree intentional homicide and first-degree recklessly endangering safety. He was released on extended supervision in 2022, which was revoked in 2024.

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama appeals court ruled Friday that the state can license and regulate freestanding birth centers as hospitals.
In a unanimous opinion overturning a lower court ruling, Alabama Court of Civil Appeals Judge Terry Moore wrote that birthing centers were hospitals under state law and subject to regulation by the Alabama Department of Public Health. 
Moore wrote that the centers were delivering “obstetrical care . . . to the public generally” under a 1949 state law defining and governing hospitals.

“We do not believe that the legislature intended that only institutions utilizing obstetrics to treat pregnant women should be treated as ‘hospitals’ and be regulated by the ADPH while institutions providing alternative midwifery care, which implicates identical health and safety concerns, should not be considered ‘hospitals’ and should not be regulated by the ADPH,” Moore wrote. 
Oasis Family Birthing Center in Birmingham and Alabama Birth Center in Huntsville filed suit against ADPH in 2023, a few months after the agency adopted new regulations requiring centers to be under the oversight of a physician or medical director and to be within 30 minutes of a hospital with OB-GYN services. 
The centers, which provide an in-between option for individuals who do not feel comfortable with a home birth but prefer an out-of-hospital birth, said the regulations would make it difficult or impossible for them to provide services around the state, particularly in rural areas that lack hospitals.  
The Alabama chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which represented the plaintiffs, said in a statement Friday that the decision could lead to birth centers not being able to provide midwifery care in the state.
“Birth centers are needed here. Midwives and doulas are needed here. We are committed to continuing this fight on behalf of our clients and all Alabamians,” JaTaune Bosby-Gilchrist, ACLU of Alabama’s executive director, said in a statement.
The ACLU said it will seek “further court review” and that the birthing centers will continue to operate while that continues.
A message seeking comment from ADPH was left Friday afternoon.
Alabama has long struggled with higher-than-average infant mortality rates. According to ADPH, the state’s infant mortality rate was 7.1 babies per 1,000 live births in 2024. That was down from 7.8 deaths per 1,000 births in 2023, but still significantly higher than the national infant mortality rate of 5.5 deaths per 1,000 live births 
Infant mortality rates for Black Alabamians remain disproportionately high and racial disparities wide. According to the ADPH data, the infant mortality rate among white Alabamians was 5.4 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2024. For Black Alabamians, the rate was 11.8 per 1,000. In 2023, the rates were 5.7 and 13.1 deaths per 1,000 births, respectively. 
Birth centers help bridge the gap for mothers in rural Alabama. Only 30% of the state’s rural hospitals have labor and delivery units, leaving many expectant parents to drive long distances for care. 
“We will continue to fight for pregnant Alabamians to be able to access high-quality midwifery care in birth centers without burdensome and unnecessary interference from the state,” Whitney White, staff attorney with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said in a statement. “The essential care birth centers provide to Alabama families has never been more necessary than it is right now, with Alabama facing a serious maternal and infant health crisis that is disproportionately affecting Black Alabamians, those with low incomes, and rural communities.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PXL_20230808_144437258-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-09 15:58:32.466950

(Maps data: Google, Airbus, CNES/Airbus, Landsat/Copernicus, Maxar Technologies)A buildup of hazardous gas at Alaska’s Red Dog mine in recent weeks forced the huge zinc and lead operation to fit workers with respirators and ramp up air monitoring at the mine and in nearby villages.
Since November, reactive ore and waste rock at the remote Northwest Alaska mine has been generating higher-than-usual amounts of sulfur dioxide — a colorless gas that, in high enough concentrations, can cause health problems.
The rock unearthed at Red Dog, one of the world’s largest zinc mines and a major employer in the region, has long generated low levels of sulfur dioxide. The gas, known as SO2, occurs naturally through a chemical reaction when minerals in Red Dog’s ore and waste rock come into contact with air.
But the emissions lately have increased because the mine has been digging up especially reactive rocks — and cold, calm weather has allowed the gas to settle over parts of the sprawling operation.
In recent weeks, sulfur dioxide drifted into mine buildings and reached levels high enough to fuel health concerns among mine employees and officials at the Indigenous-owned corporation that owns the land beneath the operation. Shareholders of the corporation, NANA, make up a significant portion of Red Dog’s workforce.
The mine’s operator, Vancouver-based Teck Resources, temporarily evacuated workers from certain areas, limited mineral production and has taken steps to drive emissions back down, according to correspondence obtained by Northern Journal. In the meantime, the company says it’s working to limit the number of workers on site.
“Many of you are concerned and frustrated and have questions regarding our…response to SO2 levels within the buildings,” a Teck supervisor said in a recent email to workers. “The leadership team takes the health and safety of our workforce seriously, including the SO2 challenges being faced.”
Teck has said that sulfur dioxide concentrations at the mine did not exceed federal health and safety standards and that, out of an abundance of caution, it has taken steps to mitigate risks and protect workers.
“Efforts to cool reactive areas and increased wind have resulted in a decline in SO2 levels in recent days,” Teck spokesperson Dale Steeves said in an email this week.
The company, he added, is working closely with federal regulators and NANA to monitor and reduce gas emissions and “ensure continued health and safety of our workforce.”
Teck does not anticipate a material impact on overall production at the mine, Steeves said.
“Red Dog is continuing to operate with appropriate health and safety measures in place,” he said.
The problems at Red Dog have played out under the radar for weeks, even as federal mine safety regulators investigated complaints.
The issue then emerged into public view earlier this month in an unusually blunt statement on social media from NANA, which has long worked closely with Teck. The Native corporation is owned by some 15,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to Northwest Alaska and receives a share of the mine’s profits.
“NANA is communicating our concerns, and the concerns of shareholders, to the operator and has been taking action within our role as the landowner to ensure those concerns are clearly conveyed and addressed,” the company said.

The statement came a day after Red Dog’s general manager — Teck employee Les Yesnik — sent NANA’s chief executive a memo laying out the situation. NANA then distributed the memo to its shareholders.
Red Dog’s main pit contains rock that’s reactive with oxygen and can “self-heat under certain environmental conditions,” Yesnik said in the memo, which was obtained by Northern Journal.
The chemical reaction between the rock and air naturally emits sulfur dioxide, which in low concentrations can cause irritation to the nose, eyes, throat and lungs and in high concentrations can cause permanent lung damage, Yesnik’s memo said.
Red Dog’s operations have generated the gas since the 1990s, but high iron levels in the ore that’s currently being processed and in the mine’s waste rock have recently created “hot spots” in the pit, Yesnik said.
Low temperatures and low winds have “allowed emissions to settle in lower-lying areas,” where some buildings are located — including where employees sleep and eat, according to the memo.
In response, Teck said, the company has adopted numerous measures to protect workers and reduce the emissions.
It has set up dozens of indoor and outdoor monitoring stations, installed new air filters and has used a water truck to cool the hot spots.
The company also has drafted plans to move reactive rock into a pit filled with water or to bury it beneath less reactive waste.
Teck has reduced production, too, though it needs to maintain some output to avoid damage from an equipment freeze-up in temperatures below minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit, Yesnik said in the memo.
NANA declined to comment.
Sulfur dioxide emissions are a rarely discussed mining problem, but the issue at Red Dog is not unprecedented, said Dave Chambers, president of the Center for Science in Public Participation, a Montana-based nonprofit that analyzes the environmental impacts of mines.
Chambers said he’s heard of similar problems at other mines with deposits rich in sulfide minerals, though he wasn’t aware of an instance when the gas emissions were high enough to cause an air quality problem. Sulfur dioxide emissions are likely much higher from other sources at mines, like diesel generators, than they are from ore or waste rock, Chambers added.
Teck has been sharing SO2 data with regulators at the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration, or MSHA, the company told employees.
That regulatory agency, part of the U.S. Department of Labor, investigated the complaints and concluded “negative findings” for each one, said labor department spokesperson Kristen Knebel.
Knebel did not immediately answer additional questions about MSHA’s actions and would not provide copies of the complaints. Northern Journal submitted a request for those records under the Freedom of Information Act; MSHA estimated the request would take one month to process.
State environmental regulators said they are monitoring the situation but only learned of it through an inquiry from Northern Journal.
Alaska’s regulations require companies to notify the Department of Environmental Conservation about releases of hazardous substances.
The department is coordinating with Teck to clarify reporting requirements “since it’s not a routine hazardous substance release, and we don’t encounter this type of situation very often,” Kimberley Maher, a regulator with the agency’s spill response program, said in an email to Northern Journal.

TPS provides a shield against deportation for people from counties in the middle of a humanitarian crises or armed conflict. Since regaining office a year ago, Trump has terminated or announced intent to terminate TPS for more than 1 million individuals, according to the American Immigration Council.
The Democrats addressed their letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Department  of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
In the case of Venezuela, Noem announced in January 2025 that the administration was ending the 18-month extension of TPS for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans that former President Joe Biden had implemented just 10 days days before he left the White House. The Biden White House had said that the extension was warranted “based on the severe humanitarian emergency the country continues to face due to political and economic crises under the inhumane Maduro regime.”
The letter sent on Friday to Rubio and Noem was signed by 70 congressional Democrats.
“Hundreds of thousands of lawful Venezuelan residents who benefited from TPS … are facing deportation in the coming weeks to instability, desperate poverty and danger — conditions that have become even more dangerous since President Trump ordered military strikes and special operations to remove dictator Nicolás Maduro,” the letter says. “Many Venezuelans are hiding out in their homes, terrified of follow-on strikes or harassment by the regime which remains in place.”
“The Trump Administration’s calamitous decision to terminate TPS for Venezuelans in January 2025 was rooted in a determination that conditions in the country had improved,” the letter adds. “This claim was baseless at the time, and, with the regime left in place, it is certainly untrue now. This termination of lawful status has caused unimaginable fear and anxiety for law-abiding Venezuelan families, who passed criminal background checks, earned work permits, and paid fees and taxes.”
The Democrats go on to say in the letter that the Trump administration has “abandoned the Venezuelans that remain in Venezuela who yearn for freedom and a democratic transition,” noting how Maduro’s “criminal accomplices remain in power,” specifically mentioning interim president Delcy Rodriguez, Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López, and Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello (who was indicted on narco-terrorism charges alongside Maduro by the U.S. Justice Department in 2020).

The Montana Cannabis and Alcohol Regulation Division (CARD) is offering its third annual opportunity for graduating high school seniors to apply for Alcohol Responsibility Matters scholarships.
Seniors who will attend a Montana college, apprentice program, or certificate institute are encouraged to apply for the scholarship, which includes coming up with a design and writing a brief paragraph dedicated to answering the question: “What does ‘Alcohol Responsibility Matters’ mean to you and your community?”
CARD will award five seniors a one-time, $2,000 scholarship.
The scholarship funds come from the National Alcohol Beverage Control Association, which distributes alcohol education awards to state member organizations, including CARD, a division of the Department of Revenue.
Selected winners will have their original artwork designs used to promote responsible alcohol consumption across Montana. According to CARD, the artwork will have a consistent theme centered on Montana and the tagline “Alcohol Responsibility Matters,” and the existing logo, along with the student’s original artwork idea.
CARD hopes to provide community-centered messages reminding individuals 21 and over of the importance of being responsible when consuming alcohol and to support year-round alcohol awareness.
The scholarship is targeted toward high school seniors, knowing that while most are under the age of 21, moving forward in life to college, or post-secondary institutions without parent or guardians guidance, there may be increased pressure to drink.
According to the scholarship page, the requirements of the submissions include the artwork design and a 250-word paragraph explaining the design, which could be used for posters, t-shirts, stickers, decals and other marketing materials.
Students may draw something, create something in PowerPoint, Illustrator, Canva, InDesign, etc., and then (if chosen) CARD will take the design/idea and work to create artwork. Generative AI, such as ChatGPT or other similar applications for essays or artwork, will not be accepted.
The application deadline is January 25, and details about the application process can be found online at the scholarship website.
In 2025, the Department of Revenue announced it had selected five scholarship winners out of 55 submissions. The winning students were from Shepard, Libby, Bozeman, Cut Bank and Thompson Falls.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/unnamed-1.png,,,2026-01-09 14:57:28.695223

The University of Delaware Fightin’ Blue Hens’ roster will welcome back a strong collection of talent from their first FBS season.
 
The NCAA football transfer portal opened on January 2, allowing players from programs across the country to look for a new home in the new year. According to ESPN, over 4,000 players entered their name into the transfer portal and only a week has gone by since the official window opened. Players will have until January 16, to enter their name into the transfer portal and even longer after that to officially choose a new place to play. 
The Blue Hens are no stranger to the advantages presented by the transfer portal. Last season, Delaware signed 12 transfers to their roster. The transfer class included the Blue Hens’ leader in receiving touchdowns — Kyre Duplessis — and defensive end Noah Matthews who finished with seven tackles for loss and two sacks. 
This offseason the Blue Hens have yet to sign any transfers, but they’re welcoming back many of their players from last year’s bowl game squad. In total, 19 players from last year’s roster announced their intent to remain with the program next season. Only two players announced their intention to depart.  
One of the first players to announce their intent to return was quarterback Nick Minicucci. The junior quarterback completed his season with multiple second place finishes in the Delaware record books trailing program legend, Joe Flacco, in completions for a season and total yards in a season. Minicucci threw for 3,683 yards and 23 touchdowns leading Conference USA’s top passing attack. His 283.31 passing yards per game landed him top ten in the nation.
In addition to Minicucci, wide receiver Sean Wilson announced via X he is returning to UD next season. Wilson finished as the Blue Hens top receiver with 68 catches and 877 receiving yards. Tight end Elijah Sessoms and running backs Jo Silver and Viron Ellison Jr. are returning to the program as well, bringing back over 1,500 yards of total offense combined from last season.
Three members of UD’s starting offensive line have announced they will be returning to the program. Anthony Caccese, Noah Rosahac and second-team all CUSA lineman Steven Demboski all announced their intent to return next season. The only member of the offensive line to announce they will not return to Newark, is starting left tackle Anwar O’Neal. 
O’Neal entered the portal before the holidays and announced via X on January 7, that he will be playing at Louisville next season. The only other Delaware player to enter the portal thus far is wide receiver Thomas Amankwaa, according to On3 and confirmed via an announcement on his X account. 
UD’s defense is benefiting from players deciding to stay just as much as the offense. 
Matthews announced he will be returning to the team next season along with fellow defensive end Brandon Gorham. Sophomore Trace Scott III announced that he will be staying with the program after ending the season tied for the team lead in sacks with three and half. CUSA’s third leading tackler, linebacker Gavin Moul, announced his return to the program via X and first-team all CUSA safety KT Seay did the same. The returning group is responsible for about 29 percent of Delaware’s total tackles last season. 
There is still plenty of time in the college football offseason for players to return, depart or transfer to and from the Fightin’ Blue Hens. The college football offseason is just beginning, but through the early portion of the transfer window Delaware is keeping hold of the talent that led the program to its first bowl victory in its first FBS season.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini_Generated_Image_e5te8ge5te8ge5te-1024x535.png,,,2026-01-09 14:57:28.695223

(Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/ Maine Morning Star)A Maine superior court judge blocked the expansion of Maine’s largest landfill on Friday, siding with the Penobscot Nation and Boston-based environmental group Conservation Law Foundation.
Penobscot County Superior Court Judge Bruce Mallonee ruled against the Department of Environmental Protection, saying the department had not done adequate fact finding to determine that expanding Juniper Ridge Landfill, located near Old Town, would benefit the public, and did not consider the environmental impacts that the landfill has on the nearby Penobscot Nation.
“For generations, we have spoken about the many impacts our community fights against at once — on our health, our lands, and the Penobscot River, the oldest citizen of our Nation,” said Penobscot Nation Chief Kirk Francis in a statement responding to the court’s decision. “This ruling affirms that those burdens must be taken seriously. We hope it signals a shift toward decisions that listen more closely to Indigenous voices and consider the full picture of the harm our communities face.”
Maine opens door for landfill expansion despite community objections

Juniper Ridge has long been a focus of the Tribe and neighboring community, members of which expressed concerns about air and water pollution. 
More than half of Maine’s landfill waste ends up at Juniper Ridge. It is owned by the state through the Bureau of General Services, which has an operating contract with NEWSME Landfill Operations, a subsidiary of waste management company Casella.
Expecting that it will reach capacity in 2028, the Maine Department of Environmental Protection determined in October 2024 that expanding the landfill would benefit the public, allowing Casella to apply for a license to expand the landfill. 
That license was approved by the department, and in November 2024, the environmental advocacy organization, along with the Penobscot Nation, appealed the department’s decision.
Last May, more than 50 people protested against the expansion, including residents of Old Town and the Penobscot Nation’s reservation at Indian Island, which includes portions of the Penobscot River and is located five miles downstream of the landfill.
Locals have argued that there has been insufficient treatment of landfill leachate — water that collects chemicals after passing through the waste — which runs into the Penobscot River. They are specifically concerned about per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, otherwise known as PFAS or forever chemicals, which are linked to a number of negative health effects like some cancers, high cholesterol, reproductive and fetal development issues, and more. 
Friday’s ruling prevents the expansion plan from moving forward under its current approval, which would have added space to handle the equivalent of 8.6 Empire State Buildings-worth of trash to the landfill, according to Conservation Law Foundation.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6846-scaled-e1760632177850-1024x708.jpg,,,2026-01-09 14:57:28.695223

Now Newsom has announced $42 billion in new revenues over three years.,"When Gov. Gavin Newsom declared today that the state will likely receive an extra $42.3 billion in tax revenue over the next three years, thus alleviating a stubborn budget deficit, the inimitable Yogi Berra’s famous observation came to mind.
“It’s like déjà vu all over again,” Berra quipped in 1961, after watching Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris, the New York Yankees’ star sluggers, hit back-to-back home runs.
Four years ago, as the state’s economy rebounded from a pandemic-caused downturn, the state’s revenues saw a brief upward spike. Someone in the administration, perhaps Newsom himself, decided that the revenue jump would be permanent and that it meant a $97.5 billion surplus over several years.
“No other state in American history has ever experienced a surplus as large as this,” Newsom bragged as he unveiled a 2022-23 fiscal year budget that topped $300 billion.
Newsom’s declaration touched off a spending spree that boosted outlays by $14 billion. But the revenues never reached the assumed level and his Department of Finance eventually — and very quietly — acknowledged that the administration had overstated income by a whopping $165 billion over four years.
The additional spending, which outpaced real revenues, created what was dubbed a “structural deficit” in the annual $20 billion range ever since, covered with an array of accounting gimmicks, spending deferrals and raids on special funds and emergency reserves.
A few weeks ago, the Legislature’s budget advisor, Gabe Petek, projected an $18 billion deficit for the 2026-27 fiscal year, rising to $35 billion later.
The draft budget that Newsom’s finance director, Joe Stephenshaw, outlined today would increase outlays by $27 billion over the current year to $321 billion, including a $248.3 billion general fund, up $20 billion.
The revenue increase projection, which Newsom mentioned in Thursday’s State of the State address, would cover all but $2.9 billion of the new spending plan, Stephenshaw said.
Simply put, if the budget’s projected $42.3 billion revenue increase is real, Newsom can conclude his governorship —– and probably segue into a presidential campaign — with the state’s finances no longer plagued by deficits.
Balancing the budget would also bolster Newsom’s opposition to calls from the left-leaning legislators and activists in his own party for tax increases to cover the shortfall and President Donald Trump’s cuts in federal health and welfare support.
However, we saw the corrosive effects of overestimating revenues in 2022, so the new forecast should be viewed skeptically.
Newsom hedges his bets by portraying the budget as a placeholder that covers little more than spending increases driven by law, inflation and caseload until more revenue data is received.
“While the budget is balanced in the 2026-27 fiscal year, with a discretionary reserve of $4.5 billion, it projects a deficit of roughly $22 billion in the 2027-28 fiscal year and shortfalls in the two years following,” the draft declares. “The administration intends to build on this budget proposal in May with a revised plan — reflecting updated revenue and spending data — that balances the budget in both the 2026-27 and 2027-28 fiscal years with adequate budget reserves.”
Having been burned badly by his phantom surplus in 2022, Newsom is obviously aware that a repeat would be politically poisonous. His more cautious approach was symbolized by how the budget was presented.
In years past, Newsom would personally go through the budget, almost line-by-line, in presentations that sometimes lasted three hours. This time, he dispatched Stephenshaw to face reporters and characterize the budget as a draft that will be updated in May, as Newsom and the Legislature face a June 15 constitutional deadline for enactment.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/010926-Budget-Presentation-FG-CM-08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-09 14:57:28.695223

This whitetail deer had its glads removed during an FWP event on Wednesday, Nov. 13. (Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)Four new hunting districts across the state recorded a detection of Chronic Wasting Disease since July 2025, the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks said Friday.
The four districts were in FWP regions 3, 4 and 6. Those regions cover the south west, north central and northeast parts of the state. 
The department announced since July, there were 433 positive Chronic Wasting Disease tests out of 8,574 tests to date, an increase from last year, though FWP said it was too early to make any authoritative call on potential new trends.
“Without this data, the risk of CWD going undetected increases, which can lead to significant, long-term declines in herd health and hunting opportunities,” a recent FWP release said. “Proactive management based on hunter-submitted data is the only way to help ensure Montana’s big game populations remain resilient for future generations.”
Of the positive results, 250 were white-tailed deer, 179 were mule deer, and four were elk. 
As a comparison, from July 1, 2024, to March 25, 2025, there were 356 positive CWD tests on slightly less than 10,000 samples, according to the 2024 CWD report, published by FWP. However, the department said it’s important to note high concentrations of animals were tested in areas already known to have CWD.
The data helps biologists track where the disease is moving and guide where the agency might take management action, such as an extended season on a particular animal and where to concentrate their sampling efforts.
“We use the proportion of positive CWD tests from adult hunter-harvested animals to calculate prevalence in each hunting district,” Jacobsen wrote. “To calculate prevalences, we use data from the last three years. We also look at new detections in hunting districts.”
From July to present, the agency processed 8,574 samples, with 428 of those returning a positive test. The fourth week of the season, Nov. 13-19, saw 1,741 samples collected — the highest sampling week ever for that period. The agency processed samples from 4,537 white-tailed deer, 3,047 mule deer, 944 elk and 46 moose.
FWP wasn’t ready to make any determinations on prevalence of the disease compared to last year, as they need to clean the data — a report on the 2025 hunting season and CWD is expected this summer. There are still active hunts on some animals as well, which could also influence the data.
“We would like to thank our hunters and local communities for your collaboration with our seasonal CWD staff who handled collecting and receiving their samples throughout the season,” Sam Treece, FWP’s wildlife CWD technician supervisor, said in a press release. “We are sincerely grateful each and every year for your contributions in aiding the wildlife heritage of Montana.”
On average, hunters received their tests back in an average of 7.6 days.
CWD is a neurological disease that elk, deer and moose can be infected with, and it’s neither a virus or bacteria. Instead, it’s a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy — a naturally occurring protein, called a prion, that is not broken down by the animal the way it should be. 
The disease can be spread through contact with feces and other bodily fluids. Importantly, soil that has been contaminated with any of those fluids can also infect other animals. CWD is always fatal to the creature, and animals can spread the disease long before they develop symptoms. 
There isn’t a cure for the disease, and there’s been no recorded transmission of CWD to a human. However, meat from CWD-positive animals should still never be eaten.
There are several ways to get animals tested — hunters can remove an animals lymph nodes and mail them in, or bring the head to any FWP regional office. The results of the test can be then found online.
About 30% of Montana’s hunting districts have CWD-positive animals, and the state has invested significant resources into tracking the disease for nearly three decades.
Extended hunting season
FWP also recently announced it was extending the season on white-tail deer hunting in some parts of southwestern Montana due to a rise in CWD cases there.
The extended season runs through Feb. 15, 2026, in all of Hunting District 309 and portions of HDs 301, 304, 311 and 312. Those are primarily along the Gallatin River corridor where white-tailed deer are most concentrated, FWP said in a press release. The goal of the hunt is to reduce the white-tailed population density.
The agency also reminded hunters to check the specific boundaries of the CWD hunt and that there are weapon restrictions in Hunting District 309.
“Reducing deer numbers in key areas is one of the most effective tools we have to slow the spread of CWD,” Region 3 wildlife manager Warren Hansen said in a press release. “Early action improves our ability to keep disease prevalence low, protect mule deer and elk from potential spillover, and maintain a healthier deer herd overall.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FWP2-1024x688.jpg,,,2026-01-09 14:57:28.695223

But, it’s classified.
Federal regulators, and the U.S. Department of Justice attorneys representing them in court, offered little explanation for the abrupt suspension of five East Coast wind projects, including Revolution Wind, in court filings submitted Thursday. The tranche of documents, spanning 160 pages, defends the Interior Department’s Dec. 22 stop work order, which is being challenged by the Revolution Wind project developers, along with the companies behind three of the four other projects. The companies have each turned to federal courts to attempt to bar the Trump administration from interfering in their projects, claiming the 90-day suspension is an executive overreach that violates constitutional separation of powers, among other laws.
For the 65-turbine Revolution Wind project already 87% complete south of Rhode Island’s coastline, the late December halt to construction was especially harmful. The 704-megawatt project already endured a monthlong pause from August to September when federal regulators first sought to stop work under the guise of national security concerns. 
The initial stop work order was temporarily tossed by U.S. Senior Judge Royce Lamberth of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Lamberth is scheduled to consider the second request for a preliminary injunction from the Revolution Wind developers, joined by the Rhode Island and Connecticut AGs, on Monday.
Ahead of the in-person hearing, Trump attorneys laid out their defense in writing to the court. They refuted allegations of constitutional breaches, and consequences for the project developers, who say they are at risk of losing $6 billion if construction cannot resume by Jan. 12.
The Trump administration’s response? 
“When it comes to the operation of the Project, the public interest in national security outweighs Revolution Wind’s alleged economic harms,” wrote Adam Gustafson, principal deputy assistant attorney general for the environment and natural resources division.










When it comes to the operation of the Project, the public interest in national security outweighs Revolution Wind’s alleged economic harms. 


– Statement by Adam Gustafson, principal deputy assistant attorney general for the environment and natural resources division, in court brief


But exactly what security concerns prompted the Trump administration to renege on the existing federal approval for the project remains fuzzy. The project had already undergone a rigorous and lengthy review of economic, environmental and security considerations.
Jacob Tyner, the Interior Department’s deputy assistant secretary for land and minerals management, pointed to a November 2025 assessment completed by the Department of War, the new name the Trump administration has given the Department of Defense. The assessment itself is classified. 
But according to Tyner, “This information included, among other things, discussion of the rapid evolution of relevant adversarial technologies and the direct impacts to national security that arise from the operation of offshore wind projects in proximity to early warning monitoring systems, and military and civilian radar systems.”
The findings set off a chain reaction: Defense leaders met with federal wind energy regulators to update them on the new analysis. Energy regulators then wrote to Revolution Wind and developers of four other projects to call for a 90-day pause because they “had not considered the specific national security risks” in prior reviews of the projects, Tyner wrote.
This despite documented analysis, and agreement, over how the towering turbines spinning in Rhode Island sound might affect military surveillance and radar systems by the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) out of its operations center in Falmouth, Massachusetts.
A November 2024 agreement between the Department of Defense, the U.S. Air Force and the Revolution Wind developers outlined ways the parties agreed to mitigate potential radar concerns, including ongoing coordination and analysis of the acoustic monitoring equipment and fiber-optic cables used in the project constitution and operations. 
The agreement also called for the project developers to give $80,000 to the Defense Department within 10 days of completion for adverse effects from its project.
In exchange, the Defense Department agreed not to object or interfere with project construction and operation, as long as the developers’ remained in “material compliance.”
“As of the effective date of this agreement, Project Owner has disclosed to the DoD Parties in writing all material facts necessary for the DoD Parties to be able to fully assess the Project’s potential adverse impacts on military operations and readiness and risks to national security,” the agreement, signed Nov. 4 2024, states.
A second declaration from Dale Marks, deputy undersecretary of acquisition and sustainment for the Defense Department, might offer some clue what changed. But nearly all of the eight-page submission is redacted. A separate classified declaration — presumably without redactions — was submitted to the court for private review by the judge.
Burgum’s initial halt to construction set out a 90-day review timeline, though it acknowledged the possibility of extending the pause. But Tyner’s declaration hinted that a resolution may never come.
“At this time, BOEM is not aware whether the national security risks can be mitigated and, if they can, whether Developers would find the proposed mitigation measures acceptable,” Tyner wrote. “Further, any potential mitigation measures may be more effectively incorporated into the Revolution Wind Project before construction is completed.”
Also affected by the suspension order are Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind, both off New York’s coastline; Vineyard Wind 1, south of Martha’s Vineyard; and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind. Developers for Sunrise Wind, Empire Wind and the Virginia project have also filed separate federal lawsuits against the Trump administration seeking to resume their projects.

The plea be held in abeyance, court records state, meaning it will be dismissed in January 2027 if he follows the conditions.
Mylar, a Republican candidate and longtime Utah attorney, was originally charged in July 2024 with a third-degree felony count of election bribery. He lost in the Republican primary in June after receiving 24% of the vote.

Prosecutors said he sent a text message to fellow GOP candidate for attorney general Trent Christensen in April 2024, saying “If you could endorse me before the convention I would definitely include you in my office. Think about it for a few days.” 
He followed up later that day with another message reading, “Please disregard that text” and saying he didn’t mean to send it and “it is not an offer etc,” charging documents said. Christensen got in touch with the Murray Police Department about the texts, according to the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office. 
Mylar’s defense attorney, Richard Van Wagoner, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.
Utah law permits pleas in abeyance for many offenses, but not for sexual crimes with victims younger than 14 or DUI. They’re also prohibited when the prosecutor and defendant do not both agree to the plea.

His nomination drew swift criticism from environmental groups in New Mexico and across the country, including Thursday in a letter from a coalition of 81 national and local environmental groups, including the Center for Biological Diversity, GreenPeace, WildEarth Guardians and the Santa Fe Forest Project. 
The coalition sent the letter to Lee, the chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and Heinrich, the ranking member, asking them to oppose Pearce’s nomination due to what members said is a long history of trying to undermine and privatize public lands. The letter cites his record in Congress, including his support in Trump’s first term of the president’s effort to shrink national monuments including Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks, Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments. 
“Mr. Pearce’s persistent calls for the privatization of public lands are alarming, especially for the millions of Americans who mere months ago witnessed—and emphatically opposed—the sell-off attempt in the reconciliation package,” the letter reads.
Source New Mexico’s phone call about the letter to Lee’s office was not immediately returned Friday. 
Lee is expected to schedule Pearce’s confirmation hearing in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee in the “coming weeks,” Heinrich spokesperson Luis Soriano told Source.

,DC,2026-01-09 19:17:41+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Landmark cases on transgender athletes at the US Supreme Court put trans rights on the line,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/landmark-cases-transgender-athletes-us-supreme-court-put-trans-rights-line,,"WASHINGTON — A pair of blockbuster cases to be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court could carry far-reaching implications for transgender rights, even as the Trump administration during the past year has rolled out a broad anti-trans agenda targeting everything from sports to military service.The court on Jan. 13 will hear challenges to laws in Idaho and West Virginia banning transgender athletes from participating in women’s sports. Both cases center on whether the laws violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.The West Virginia case before the Supreme Court also questions whether the state’s law violates Title IX — a landmark federal civil rights law that bars schools that receive federal funding from practicing sex-based discrimination. Lower court rulings have temporarily blocked the states from implementing the bans, to varying extents, and Republican attorneys general in Idaho and West Virginia have asked the Supreme Court to intervene. “We know we have an uphill fight, and our hope is certainly that we prevail,” Joshua Block, senior counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union’s LGBT & HIV Project, who will be presenting oral arguments in the West Virginia case, said at a Jan. 8 ACLU press briefing. “But we also hope that regardless of what happens, this case isn’t successfully used as a tool to undermine the rights of transgender folks more generally in areas far beyond just athletics.” The outcome of the oral arguments before a court dominated 6-3 by conservative justices will be closely watched. Nearly 30 states have laws that ban trans students' participation in sports consistent with their gender identity, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an independent think tank.Idaho case  The justices are taking up both cases in one day. First will be Little v. Hecox, which contests a 2020 Idaho law that categorically bans trans athletes from competing on women’s and girls’ sports teams. Lindsay Hecox sued over the ban in 2020, just months before the law was set to take effect. Though Hecox wanted to try out for the women’s track and cross-country teams at Boise State University, the Idaho law — the first of its kind in the nation — would have prevented her from doing so because she is transgender. A federal court in Idaho halted the law from taking effect later that year. A federal appeals court initially upheld the ruling in 2023 but later adjusted the scope of it in 2024 to only apply to Hecox, not other athletes. Idaho appealed to the Supreme Court in July 2024.Since that time, Hecox has asked both an Idaho federal court and the Supreme Court to drop the case. An Idaho federal judge in October rejected that attempt, but the Supreme Court deferred the request until after oral argument — meaning justices could still dismiss the case.“The Supreme Court is trying to decide whether Idaho can preserve women’s sports based on biological sex, or must female be redefined based on gender identity,” Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador said at a Jan. 8 press briefing ahead of the oral arguments.“I think Idaho is just trying to protect fairness, safety and equal protection for girls and women in sports,” Labrador said at the briefing alongside West Virginia Attorney General John McCuskey, hosted by the conservative legal advocacy group Alliance Defending Freedom.  West Virginia caseAfter the Idaho case, the justices will hear arguments in West Virginia v. B.P.J., which centers on a 2021 Mountain State law that also bans trans athletes from participating on women’s and girls’ sports teams. McCuskey argued that his state’s law “supports and bolsters the original intent and the continuing intent and purpose of Title IX.” McCuskey said the law complies with the Equal Protection Clause because it “treats all biological males and all biological females identically” and “doesn’t ban anyone from playing sports.” Becky Pepper-Jackson, who was 11 at the time, wanted to try out for the girls' cross-country team when starting middle school, but would have been prevented from doing so under the West Virginia law because she is transgender. Her mother sued on her behalf in 2021.A federal appeals court in 2024 barred West Virginia from enforcing the ban, prompting the state to ask the nation’s highest court to intervene.  White House, Congress zero in on trans athletesMeanwhile, President Donald Trump’s administration has taken steps at the federal level to prohibit trans athletes’ participation in women’s sports teams aligning with their gender identity. Trump signed an executive order in February 2025 that banned such participation and made it the policy of the United States to “rescind all funds from educational programs that deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities, which results in the endangerment, humiliation, and silencing of women and girls and deprives them of privacy.”The NCAA promptly changed its policy to comply with the order, limiting “competition in women’s sports to student-athletes assigned female at birth only.” In late 2024, prior to the policy shift, NCAA President Charlie Baker told Congress that of the more than half-million total athletes in NCAA schools, he knew of fewer than 10 who were transgender. The GOP-led House passed a measure in January 2025 that would bar transgender students from participating on women’s school sports teams consistent with their gender identity. But Senate Democrats in March blocked an attempt at imposing such a ban and codifying Trump’s executive order. Forty-eight GOP members of Congress argued in a September amicus brief supporting Idaho and West Virginia that “if allowed to stand, the interpretation of the lower courts will unsettle the very promises that Congress made to generations of young women and men through Title IX.” On the flip side, 130 congressional Democrats stood behind the two transgender athletes in a November amicus brief, noting that “categorical bans preventing transgender students from participating on sports teams consistent with their gender identity impose significant harm on all children — especially girls.” The group argued that such bans “do not meet the standards this Court has put in place to assess discrimination based on sex — whether as a matter of Title IX or under the Equal Protection Clause.” Trump’s broader anti-trans agenda has extended beyond athletic participation in the nearly one year since he took office. He signed executive orders that: make it the “policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female;” restrict access to gender-affirming care for kids; and aim to bar openly transgender service members from the U.S. military. ‘Textbook discrimination’ The Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group, has noted that there has been “considerable disinformation and misinformation about what the inclusion of transgender youth in sports entails” and that trans students’ sports participation “has been a non-issue.”In a statement ahead of oral arguments, HRC’s senior director of legal policy Cathryn Oakley said “every child, no matter their background, race, or gender, should have access to a quality education where they can feel safe to learn and grow — and for many kids that involves being a part of a school sports team.”Oakley added that “to deny transgender kids the chance to participate in school sports alongside their peers simply because of who they are is textbook discrimination — and it’s unconstitutional.”",,,,2026-01-09 14:57:28.695223

(Photo by Annice Lyn/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — In South Carolina, 16- and 17-year-olds can’t smoke, open a credit card or vote, but they can get married under a law some legislators and advocates are trying to change.
Until 2019, a loophole in state law allowed judges to issue marriage licenses to children of any age if they were pregnant or gave birth, allowing thousands to get married over the course of two decades. A law passed that year made clear that only those 16 and up could get married, with parental permission.
But as more states do away with underage marriage altogether, some are pushing South Carolina to set a firm floor of 18 years old.
Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto is trying again to get a bill he’s proposed during every two-year session since 2019 past the finish line. The proposal didn’t get a hearing during last year’s legislative session.
“I think that (marriage) is one of the biggest decisions anyone will ever make,” the Orangeburg Democrat said. “It should be done by someone whose mind is fully developed.”
Teenagers don’t magically wake up more mature on their 18th birthday than they were at 17, said Alex Goyette with Tahirih Justice Center, who advocates for bills raising the minimum marriage age.
But 18-year-olds have more opportunities than 17-year-olds. As someone who’s considered an adult by law, an 18-year-old can hire a lawyer and sign other legal documents on their own. Finding an apartment is easier, as is finding a full-time job, Goyette said.
“That’s really important for someone who is trying to resist an unwanted marriage or to leave an abusive situation,” he said.
Since Delaware became the first state to set a minimum age of 18 for marriage in 2018, 15 states have followed suit, according to the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit center, which works to protect women from violence and help victims. Five of those states did so within the past year.
South Carolina is one of 20 states that allows people as young as 16 to get married. Six states allow marriage as young as 15 or don’t have an age limit at all, according to the advocacy group.
The biggest challenge the advocacy group faces is time. Bills about their states’ legal marrying age generally aren’t among legislators’ top priorities, making it more difficult to get a hearing scheduled amid the frequent chaos of a part-year legislative session, Goyette said.
But the issue is an important one, with the potential for far-reaching impacts, he added.
Girls married before turning 18 are more likely to face domestic abuse than their counterparts, according to studies Tahirih Justice Center compiled. Marrying young often separates girls from support networks they might otherwise form through school, friends and family, making it more difficult for many to get help, Goyette said.
Underage brides are also less likely to finish high school or attend college, more likely to live in poverty, and more susceptible to long-term mental and physical health problems, according to the nonprofit.
“This, obviously, has devastating lifelong harms,” Goyette said.
Between 70% and 80% of marriages that include someone under the age of 18 end in divorce, the advocacy group found.
“These are not the foundational lifelong partnerships that we like to think of when we’re talking about a marriage,” Goyette said.
As more states raise the legal age for marriage, Goyette worries people may start traveling to South Carolina to take advantage of its comparatively lax laws about marrying underage, he said.
Some of South Carolina’s neighboring states have already approved stricter laws.
In Georgia, marriage is limited to those who are 18 and older. Tennessee and Florida both have age floors of 17. North Carolina also has a minimum marriage age of 16, but its law includes more safeguards, including allowing the other spouse to be no more than four years older and requiring a judge to evaluate whether the marriage “serves the best interest” of the person under 18.
South Carolina’s law does not include such safeguards that could prevent some unwanted marriages, Goyette said. As long as a minor’s parent signs off, any certified official can issue a 16-year-old a marriage license in the state.
“Until every state moves on this issue, kids across the United States are in danger,” Goyette said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/end-child-marriages-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-09 14:57:28.695223

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska lawmaker Jared Storm of David City has asked the Legislature’s Executive Board to reprimand progressive lawmaker Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha for removing and later returning part of a Nebraska Capitol display on American history from conservative nonprofit PragerU.
Earlier this week, Cavanaugh said she removed the frames because “we are not allowed to adhere anything to walls in the hallway of the Capitol.” She said generally any such display would be placed near the information desk and not in the Capitol’s hallways.

“Such conduct is unbecoming of a member of the Nebraska Legislature…. elected officials should be held to a higher standard than members of the general public,” said Storm on the floor. 
Cavanaugh said she tried not to damage the artwork and called the Nebraska State Patrol to let them know where the paintings were. The patrol returned the posters to the Nebraska Capitol Commission, and the images were rehung. No “apparent damage” was done to the art. 
Storm, a Republican in the officially nonpartisan Legislature where the GOP holds a supermajority, said he thinks her actions ares a serious matter that needs to be addressed. 
“I think there are a lot of people in the state and nationwide that were upset to see those items pulled off the wall,” Storm told the Examiner. “They want to see some consequences.”

Cavanaugh declined to comment to the Examiner. She was seen talking to Storm and lawmakers on the floor as lawmakers worked on filing bills. She later said she apologized to lawmakers personally. 
Before lawmakers adjourned for the day Friday, Cavanaugh went to the mic on the floor and expressed remorse for what she did on the first day. 
“I should not have done [it] … I have regretted it pretty much ever since, and I regret putting all of my colleagues in the position to have to deal with the repercussions of my actions,” Cavanaugh said. “ I hope to do better. I appreciate the grace that you all have given me this morning in talking with me, and I hope that we can move forward in a productive way for the remainder of this session. I don’t want to be what stands between us and good policy for the people of Nebraska.”

The Executive Board met after lawmakers adjourned for the day. State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, Exec Board chair, said the issues will be discussed in a closed meeting of the board but said Cavanaugh’s apologies were “sincere.”
Nebraska lawmakers are dealing with trying to close the state’s $471 million budget hole and weighing whether to expel a fellow lawmaker for the first time in state history, State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst. 
His expulsion hearing is set for Monday. 
Speaker John Arch of La Vista said the PragerU display is allowed in the Capitol with approval from the Nebraska Capitol Commission, which the exhibit had. 
The nonprofit behind the images has faced criticism for sharing content that historians consider misleading and inaccurate. The latest display is part of a push from the Trump administration’s White House Task Force 250, outreach designed to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the U.S.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota prosecutors are asking the public for evidence in the killing of a 37-year-old Minneapolis woman by an ICE agent on Wednesday after the Trump administration froze local law enforcement out of the investigation.
“Every moment in these cases is precious,” said Attorney General Keith Ellison at a news conference in Minneapolis on Friday. “If you have information bearing on the outcome of this matter in any way, please share it.”
The Attorney General’s Office and the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office set up a portal for people to submit photos, videos and other evidence they think may help prosecutors understand the case and the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension will catalogue the submissions.
The BCA typically investigates police shootings and was on the scene at Portland Avenue near 34th Street collecting evidence after an ICE officer, who has been identified as Jonathan Ross, shot and killed Renee Nicole Good in her Honda Pilot.
But on Thursday, the agency announced the U.S. Attorney’s Office had made the unusual decision that the FBI would be the sole investigative agency, effectively freezing out local law enforcement.
“Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands,” BCA superintendent Drew Evans said. “As a result, the BCA has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation.”
Gov. Tim Walz and other state Democrats have expressed doubt that the public could trust the results of an investigation conducted solely by the federal government.
“Now that Minnesota has been taken out of the investigation, it feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome,” Walz said.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said at a Thursday news conference that local officials “have not been cut out. They don’t have any jurisdiction in this investigation.”
The standoff over jurisdiction adds to a contentious fight between state leaders and the Trump administration over fraud in state social service programs and a surge of thousands of federal agents and officers in what the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is calling its largest operation ever.
Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty emphasized that local officials have the authority to both investigate the shooting and potentially bring criminal charges based on the evidence.
“We do have jurisdiction,” Moriarty said. “We cannot make any decision, however, if there is not evidence submitted to our office.”
Moriarty said the FBI has possession of key evidence, including Good’s car and the shell casings from the officer’s gun. She also acknowledged they have really no access to federal law enforcement officers for interviews.
She said she does not have concerns about the integrity of the FBI, but rather that they won’t turn over their findings for state prosecutors to review.
“In the past, the FBI has invited us to see a high level overview of their investigation, but we were prohibited from seeing the entire investigation or talking about what we saw,” Moriarty said.
Prosecutions of federal law enforcement officers are also complicated by the fact that they have immunity from state prosecution for carrying out their duties.
But legal experts emphasize that immunity does not extend to officers who use unreasonable and excessive force.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260107_862-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-09 14:12:47.376567

Where does all this information about my legislators come from?
My Legislator is powered by the Digital Democracy database. It combines a variety of information and data from throughout state government that is publicly available but isolated and difficult to access. This database combines these related data sources so they can be compared to reveal relationships, patterns and aberrations in the Legislature and the policy-making process. 
The database includes four categories of information: transcripts, bill information, financial information and district data. Get a full breakdown on our Digital Democracy data sources and methodology page.
How are legislator rankings calculated?
We use standard competition (“1224”) ranking to determine legislators’ ranks. All legislators with the same value (e.g. number of bills passed) share the same rank, after which a gap is left in the ranking numbers. For example, if two legislators tie for the second-most bills passed, the ranks will be 1, 2, 2, 4, 5, and so on (skipping 3).
This means that if there are last-place ties, the lowest rank will not be 120, the total number of California legislators. Depending on how many people make up last-place ties, the lowest rank may be different across categories.  
How is legislator bipartisanship calculated?
Our bipartisanship scoring is based on bill authorship records. We count the number of instances in which a legislator of one party authors or co-authors a bill version with a member of another party. For example, if a Democrat legislator was the lead author for a bill version and Republican legislators are recorded as co-authors, then we consider that an instance of bipartisanship.
Lead authors are primarily responsible for the content of the bill and guiding it through the legislative process. Co-authors are legislators who, with the permission of the lead authors, add their name to the bill in a show of support for the bill; they are not usually responsible for the specific wording of the bill.
There are three combinations that we count as instances of bipartisanship:

Republican lead author(s) with Democrat lead author(s)
Republican lead author(s) with Democrat co-author(s)
Democrat lead author(s) with Republican co-author(s)

Each bill version that matches one of the three combinations counts as one instance, increasing the scores of all involved legislators by one. Then, we rank the legislators based on their final scores.
What are “noteworthy” votes of the week?
Lawmakers may cast hundreds of votes in a week, more than can reasonably fit into a newsletter. We use a range of metrics from Digital Democracy to assess which of your legislators’ votes to highlight, including: 

Bills with votes that diverge from any legislators’ past voting patterns
Intensity of discussions on bills, such as the number and length of back-and-forth debates between speakers
Number and influence of organizations taking positions on bills
Bills’ relevance to current news coverage or ongoing policy debates 
Amount of text added to and removed from bills
Overall number of speakers during legislative discussions

What do the bill statuses mean?
The PASS and FAIL statuses that we show in the newsletter indicate the vote results by a particular committee or chamber. 
A failed vote does not necessarily mean that the bill has died and cannot move forward. Committees can vote to reconsider a bill that they had not originally passed.
In order for a bill to get to the governor’s desk, the same version of the bill must pass both Senate and Assembly floors at least once.
Can I sign up for more than two legislators?
Right now, you can only sign for one state senator and one assemblymember per email address. If you’re interested in tracking more than two legislators, you can sign up for the newsletter using another email address.

Hoskins’ lawyer, Kathleen Hunker of the attorney general’s office, made the admission during a hearing in a court case challenging the ballot summary and said it would be revised in negotiations with sponsors of the referendum.
“On a further reflection of the ballot title, the secretary has come to believe that the language, though defensible, does come close enough to the line of being inherently argumentative and likely to create prejudice,” Hunker told Cole County Circuit Judge Brian Stumpe. “That means we can do better, and so we are going to withdraw our opposition to the plaintiff’s claim about how the language is inherently argumentative.”
A political action committee called People Not Politicians on Dec. 9 turned in more than 300,000 signatures to force a statewide vote on the redistricting plan Republicans muscled through a September special session. The PAC objected to the ballot summary as soon as it became public and filed a lawsuit on Nov. 20. 
Chuck Hatfield, attorney for People Not Politicians, told Stumpe that Hoskins will have to admit more — that the language he wrote is insufficient and unfair — to meet the standards for revising the summary.
“Your honor can’t enter an order just because it’s close to the line,” Hatfield said. “We’re going to have to have a finding that it’s insufficient and unfair. And I’m asking them to agree to that, and if they don’t, then we need a trial.”
The case before Stumpe was scheduled for a trial next Friday. He set a new date, Feb. 9, in case there is no agreement on what the revised summary should say.
Denny Hoskins isn’t verifying one-third of signatures for vote on Missouri’s gerrymandered map

The ballot summary written by Hoskins asks if voters approve the law, “which repeals Missouri’s existing gerrymandered congressional plan that protects incumbent politicians, and replaces it with new congressional boundaries that keep more cities and counties intact, are more compact, and better reflects statewide voting patterns?”
People Not Politicians objects to the characterization of the reapportionment made in 2022 as a “gerrymandered congressional plan that protects incumbents” and the factual basis for saying it keeps more cities and counties intact. The bill itself is just a list of voting districts and counties assigned to each district and the summary Hoskins wrote cannot be found in its contents, the PACs court filings state.
The summary’s statement about statewide voting patterns also brought objections. Recent elections gave Republicans about 60% of the vote and Democrats about 40%. The new map would give Democrats 12.5% of the state delegation instead of one-quarter.
Republicans want the new congressional map to please President Donald Trump, who demanded the changes as a means to protect the GOP’s slim majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Using the new map, Republicans hope to win seven of the state’s eight congressional seats by adding enough GOP votes to flip the 5th District, currently held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City. Republicans currently hold six of the eight seats.
If People Not Politicians and Hoskins’ office can agree on the factual basis for changing the summary, it would end the case but not litigation over the special session and the congressional map.
There are at least eight other lawsuits, six in state court and two in federal court, directly or indirectly related to the actions of the legislature or People Not Politicians.
The most recently filed case challenges assertions by Hoskins and Attorney General Catherine Hanaway that the map passed in September took effect on Dec. 11, 90 days after the end of the special session.
In that case, filed by the ACLU of Missouri, the state is accusing People Not Politicians and Hatfield of encouraging a lawsuit the PAC could not bring on its own. It has subpoenaed Hatfield, People Not Politicians Director Richard von Glahn and the PAC for records the state believes will show the connection.
“The state believes that PNP, Von Glahn or their agents recruited (the ACLU plaintiffs) as proxies to bring this lawsuit,” Solicitor General Louis Capozzi wrote in one filing in the case.
And the state is seeking sanctions against Hatfield in a federal case dismissed in early December that sought to block the petition drive entirely. In the federal filing, Capozzi argued that Hatfield admitted in federal court that the map would take effect even if signatures were submitted to force a vote.
“Yet during the following days, defendants and Mr. Hatfield personally have aggressively and repeatedly communicated the opposite position to the media, stating unambiguously that their mere act of submitting referendum signatures immediately froze (the redistricting law) and prevented it from going into effect,” Capozzi wrote.
In the Friday hearing before Stumpe, Hatfield noted that Capozzi is seeking sanctions and making accusations that he or People Not Politicians is sponsoring the case over when the map takes effect. The order from Stumpe directing Hoskins to revise the ballot summary needs to settle all legal issues in the case, he said.
“Mr. Capozzi sought sanctions against me in federal court, and he’s either confused about what happened in federal court, or he’s intentionally misrepresenting what happened in federal court,” Hatfield said. “I’m assuming he’s confused about what happened, and I don’t want any confusion here.”
There is also confusion over which of the more than 300,000 signatures will be checked to see if the referendum petition meets the threshold of approximately 110,000 signatures spread over six congressional districts. 
In court, and in media statements, Hoskins and his attorneys have said only signature pages with at least one signature dated Oct. 14 or later will be checked. Hoskins approved the form of the petition on Oct. 13.
Of the 49,773 pages with signatures, 33,068 have been sent to local election authorities to verify whether the signatures are from registered voters. The rest, Hoskins’ office said Friday in a statement to The Independent, “having invalid dates were scanned, retained, and organized separately.”
Speaking on KMOX radio on Wednesday morning, Hoskins repeated the statement that signatures aren’t being checked.
“We’re not counting those,” Hoskins said. “And, you know, unless a judge issues a court order and says, hey, yes, you must count these. But otherwise, we’ve set those aside. They should not count toward that referendum.“
But in statements to People Not Politicians, Chrissy Peters, Hoskins’ director of elections, said the pages retained in the secretary of state’s office are being checked for signature verification.
In a statement intended to clarify the confusion, Rachael Dunn, spokeswoman for Hoskins, said Friday that no signature checks are being made in Hoskins to determine if the petition has sufficient signatures to be placed on the ballot. 
She said only signatures on pages sent to local election authorities will be counted.
“The secretary of state’s Office is not,” Dunn wrote, “utilizing any lines reviewed on pages dated Oct. 13 and earlier for determination towards sufficiency.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/032625_RighttoLifeHoskins-1024x615.jpg,,,2026-01-09 13:59:16.766680

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)A new public opinion survey of 600 likely Republican primary voters shows Naples U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds is running away with the 2026 Republican race for governor.
Donalds, who was elected to Florida’s 19th Congressional District in 2020, leads Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis — who has not declared a candidacy for governor — by “only” 13 points, 39%-26%, in a poll conducted by Fabrizio, Lee & Associates, a GOP political polling firm.
However, when voters are informed that Donalds has already been endorsed by President Donald Trump, his lead swells to 58 points, 68%-10%.
When GOP voters were asked how they would vote were the gubernatorial race held today, Donalds leads investment firm CEO James Fishback, 47%-5%. His lead leaps to 76%-6% over Fishback when voters are informed about the Trump endorsement. Former House Speaker Paul Renner gets 4%, but that number drops to 1% when informed about the Trump endorsement.
Lt. Gov. Jay Collins has discussed entering the race, but has yet to do so. The pollsters write that despite a high-profile series of television ads promoting him that aired in the last part of 2025, the needle hasn’t moved at all for the LG.
“Any sugar high from Jay Collins’ multimillion ad buy has completely dissipated,” they write. “Virtually no RPVs [Republican primary voters] recall seeing anything about Collins (only 16%) and Donalds crushes him in every ballot permutation.”
There have been no major polls of the Democratic primary race, which features former GOP U.S. Rep. David Jolly and Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings.

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)After Idaho’s top election official gave the federal government a list of all Idaho registered voters that scrubbed their personal information, the U.S. Department of Justice says it wants the unredacted list.
The Justice Department offered Idaho a deal that would let the federal law enforcement agency audit the state’s voter rolls. And a Justice Department attorney hinted the agency could sue Idaho — like it has sued 23 other states — if election officials don’t turn over the full records that the Trump administration demanded. That’s according to communications in December that the Idaho Capital Sun obtained through a public records request.
Trump’s DOJ offers states confidential deal to remove voters flagged by feds

Since then, Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane said his office and the Justice Department have been negotiating over whether and how to share Idaho’s full data — which he portrayed as a complex legal issue. He said he isn’t nervous that his office will be sued, but it could happen.
“Every indication to me is that we are having a good dialogue. And they seem to be willing, there’s a willingness with them to engage with us in that dialogue,” McGrane told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview Tuesday. “And so at the moment, I’m not nervous that we’re going to be sued, but it’s always a possibility.”
In September, the U.S. Justice Department asked states to turn over their full voter registration records — with identifiable information on registered voters. 
The Justice Department says it wants Idaho’s data to ensure election integrity. But as the Trump administration has ramped up immigration enforcement, some fear how the federal government will use the data. Trump has falsely claimed that droves of noncitizens vote, a crime which is actually rare nationally and in Idaho.  
The Justice Department did not directly respond to the Idaho Capital Sun’s questions about its negotiations with Idaho, or whether the agency would sue the state.
“Clean voter rolls and basic election safeguards are requisites for free, fair, and transparent elections,” Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon said in a statement. “The DOJ Civil Rights Division has a statutory mandate to enforce our federal voting rights laws, and ensuring the voting public’s confidence in the integrity of our elections is a top priority of this administration.”

 ‘You may have seen in the news that we have sued six states earlier this week,’ Justice Department attorney tells Idaho official

After the Justice Department first asked for Idaho’s data, McGrane only gave the Justice Department access to a de-identified voter registration list, which the agency routinely shares with people and organizations that request it. 
“After consulting with the Idaho Attorney General’s Office, we will be sharing a copy of our publicly available file, which does not contain any personally identifiable information,” McGrane wrote to the Justice Department in a Sept. 22 letter. “We welcome a dialogue with your office to continue to discuss the broader efforts to ensure the accuracy of Idaho’s voter rolls.”

But more than a month later, the Justice Department re-upped its request for Idaho’s full voter rolls. 
On Dec. 4, David Vandenberg, an attorney in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, was calling to follow up on getting Idaho’s full voter registration list.
“You may have seen in the news that we have sued six states earlier this week for refusing to provide their voter registration lists,” Vandenberg said in a Dec. 4 voicemail to former Idaho Chief Deputy Secretary of State Robert McQuade. “And we’re preparing additional lawsuits. I’d like to keep everyone out of that as much as possible. But I haven’t heard anything back from you all.”
Days later, on Dec. 8, he sent an email to McQuade saying the Justice Department “is requiring an unredacted copy of Idaho’s statewide voter-registration list by Friday, December 12, 2025, as previously demanded.”
Less than an hour later, McQuade replied by detailing Idaho’s efforts to purge noncitizens from the state’s voter roll, which stemmed from a 2024 executive order by Gov. Brad Little. 
“After working closely with the Idaho Department of Transportation and using” a federal immigration database called SAVE, “we worked to verify citizenship for all of Idaho’s 1.1 million registered voters. Following this work, we provided data on approximately 30 individuals to the Idaho State Police (ISP) for investigation as possible non-citizen registrants/voters,” McQuade wrote. 
The number of suspected noncitizen voters in Idaho referred for prosecution was even smaller. 
“It’s our understanding that once the investigation was completed, around August or September of this year, ISP referred about a dozen or so folks to the U.S. Attorney’s Office here in Idaho for possible prosecution,” he added. “We have not heard where these investigations have led since.”
The Idaho Secretary of State’s Office is still verifying citizenship “on all newly registered voters prior to each election to ensure only citizens vote,” he added.    



 Idaho Department of Health and Welfare gave the feds fully identifiable data on SNAP enrolees

Months before the Justice Department sought state voter registration lists, the U.S. Department of Agriculture asked states for help to build a database for managing a food benefits program called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP or food stamps.

USDA told states its request — stemming from an executive order in March by President Donald Trump that focused on stopping fraud, waste and abuse — was to build a database meant to “strengthen SNAP and government program integrity,” according to a July 9 letter USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins sent Idaho. 
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare gave USDA identifiable information, including enrollee’s names, addresses, birth days, Social Security numbers and eligibility information like income and expense data, agency spokesperson AJ McWhorter told the Idaho Capital Sun.
Like the Justice Department’s request for voter rolls, USDA’s request was a first for Idaho.
“This is the first time that USDA has asked for information on our entire caseload,” McWhorter said. 
Asked what the USDA has done with Idaho’s SNAP data, a USDA spokesperson who requested to not be named said: “We will not comment on pending litigation.”
 



 Why Idaho’s Secretary of State says sharing the state’s full voter roll is complicated

In an interview Tuesday, McGrane said his office has since been in talks with the Justice Department. The Idaho Secretary of State’s Office hasn’t shared more data or promised to yet, he said.
The Justice Department also in December offered Idaho a deal to share the data that would direct state election officials to remove voters deemed allegedly ineligible from the state’s voter registration roll. The Justice Department has offered similar, confidential deals to at least 11 other states, Stateline reported.

Idaho’s deal would allow the Justice Department to audit the state’s voter rolls, and would direct state election officials to purge alleged ineligible voters. McGrane said he hasn’t signed the deal. He said he hasn’t seen the Justice Department do this under any other presidential administration.
But he said he’s “very confident in Idaho’s processes for verifying voter information with very clean voter rolls.”
Part of Idaho’s talks with the Justice Department revolve around legal issues specific to Idaho around sharing voter lists, McGrane said. For one, because Idaho offers same-day voter registration on election days, the state is exempt from the National Voter Registration Act, which McGrane said is among the main authorities that the Justice Department has leveraged to get voter data from states. He said Idaho law also limits how the state shares voter lists with third-party entities, requiring certain security measures. 
In September, when McGrane only shared Idaho’s redacted voter list, he touted Idaho’s efforts to purge noncitizens from voter rolls. As part of that, his office already works with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to verify citizenship.
“It’s not as clear what DOJ’s intentions are at this point, other than saying they’re auditing all the states,” McGrane said. “And so we’re just making sure that we do that, and that any data that we would share with them is handled securely, and that it’s protecting voter information.”
In a statement last week, Justice Department spokesperson Natalie Baldassarre said the Trump administration is prioritizing enforcing election laws.
“Enforcing the Nation’s elections laws is a priority in this administration and in the Civil Rights Division. Congress gave the Justice Department authority under” several federal laws, including the National Voter Registration Act, the Help America Vote Act and the Civil Rights Act, “to ensure that states have proper voter registration procedures and programs to maintain clean voter rolls containing only eligible voters in federal elections,” she said. “The recent request by the Civil Rights Division for state voter rolls is pursuant to that statutory authority, and the responsive data is being screened for ineligible voter entries.”

La representación del profesorado en Cal State está muy rezagada respecto al creciente número de estudiantes latinos. Esto supone una carga para los pequeños círculos de profesorado latino que asumen más tareas de mentoría, muchas veces en puestos sin titularidad y con salarios más bajos.


This article is also available in English. Read it here.
En la última década, los latinos en el sistema de la Universidad Estatal de California no han representado más del 15% de todos los instructores, aun cuando representaron casi la mitad del cuerpo estudiantil en los últimos años.
Incluso en Cal State Los Ángeles, donde en 2024 un enorme 75% de su población estudiantil era latina, solo alrededor de una cuarta parte de su personal docente lo era, según datos de Cal State compilados por CalMatters. El número de estudiantes latinos ha crecido a un ritmo acelerado, y todos los 22 campus de Cal State, excepto unoEditSign , se han clasificado como Instituciones al Servicio de los Hispanos, lo que significa que al menos el 25% de los estudiantes universitarios de tiempo completo son latinos, y la mayoría son de bajos recursos. Algunos profesores latinos afirman que tienen un peso adicional, ya que son buscados desproporcionadamente por estudiantes latinos para mentoría. Esto también puede recaer sobre los profesores de tiempo parcial y completo, que constituyen la mayor parte del profesorado latino, pero tienen un salario más bajo, incluso aquellos que trabajan a tiempo completo y asumen tareas adicionales.
 “Cuando puedes ver a latinos que se parecen a ti, que tal vez tienen el mismo punto de partida, la misma experiencia de vida que tú, puedes ver lo que es posible”, dijo Feliza Ortiz-Licon, quien ha trabajado durante mucho tiempo con estudiantes universitarios de primera generación y ahora es vicepresidenta ejecutiva de la Campaña para la Oportunidad Universitaria, una organización sin fines de lucro de California que aboga por el acceso y la finalización equitativos de los estudios universitarios.
El profesorado afirma que las principales barreras para acceder a la docencia incluyen la escasa mentoría y la escasa promoción de los programas que les ayudan a obtener su doctorado. Además, estos programas ofrecen plazas limitadas. Las normas culturales subyacentes también han disuadido a generaciones de latinos de ingresar al mundo académico. Los campus de Cal State han continuado sus esfuerzos para diversificar el profesorado, por ejemplo, mediante la contratación por grupos o “clusters”, en la que se contrata a grupos de profesores por sus áreas de especialización y trayectorias específicas.
 Aun así, estos esfuerzos han hecho poco para aumentar el número de profesores latinos.
 Por ejemplo, en el otoño de 2024, Cal State contaba con 27,505 instructores, pero solo 4,079 eran latinos. Para alcanzar la paridad con el número de estudiantes latinos, el sistema habría necesitado 13,477 educadores latinos.


 ¿Por qué hay tan pocos latinos en la academia?
Amy Bentley-Smith, portavoz de Cal State, señala el bajo número de latinos que ingresan a programas de posgrado a nivel nacional. En 2023, los latinos representaban solo alrededor del 14% de los estudiantes de posgrado a nivel nacional, según un informe del Consejo de Escuelas de Posgrado.
 CalMatters intentó hablar con varios funcionarios de la Oficina del Canciller de Cal State, pero el portavoz indicó que no estaban disponibles para ser entrevistados para este artículo. En su lugar, Bentley-Smith envió la siguiente respuesta por correo electrónico: “Hemos sido líderes durante mucho tiempo en abrir puertas a las oportunidades y aumentar el acceso a la educación superior entre todos los californianos, incluidas las poblaciones históricamente subrepresentadas”, escribió Bentley-Smith. Agregó que Cal State supera consistentemente el porcentaje nacional de profesores hispanos, que representaron alrededor del 6% de todos los empleados a tiempo completo en 2023, según el Centro Nacional de Estadísticas de Educación.
Entre los pocos latinos con títulos avanzados, el 10 % ha obtenido un doctorado, según un análisis del Pew Research Center de los datos de la Encuesta sobre la Comunidad Estadounidense de 2021. Generalmente, se requiere una maestría para dar clases en Cal State, y un doctorado para un puesto de profesor titular. En sus investigaciones a lo largo de los años, la Campaña por la Oportunidad Universitaria ha atribuido el bajo nivel educativo de los latinos a las altas tasas de pobrezaEditSign , las presiones para trabajar y mantener a la familia y la falta de acceso a recursos e informaciónEditSign para acceder a la educación superior.

Y luego está el síndrome del impostor. Desde que empezó a trabajar como asesora académica en la facultad de negocios de Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Yesenia Márquez-Beas ha visto a innumerables estudiantes llegar a su puerta sintiéndose que no se merecen triunfar en el aula. Considera que esas dudas son mucho más comunes entre los estudiantes latinos que entre otros.
 “Quizás nuestra latinidad nos está frenando un poco para salir a buscar posiciones que vemos tan lejanas”, dijo Márquez-Beas.
 Progresar a través del ámbito académico hacia la docencia rara vez es parte de la conversación cuando se trata de caminos después de la graduación, dijo Márquez-Beas.
 Muchos latinos se rigen por ciertas normas culturales, señaló Ortiz-Licon, de la Campaña por la Oportunidad Universitaria. “No quiero molestar” es una de ellas. Este enfoque mantiene a los estudiantes reacios a buscar ayuda o mentores, dijo Ortiz-Licon, quien en su momento fue estudiante de primera generación.
 Anthonio Reyes, presidente del gobierno estudiantil de Cal State Bakersfield, estuvo de acuerdo en que muchos estudiantes latinos de primera generación tienen el “mal hábito” de no hablar sobre sus problemas. Después de la secundaria en Bakersfield, Reyes asistió a la Universidad Estatal de San Francisco, donde se sintió aislado e incapaz de buscar ayuda de sus profesores. “Eso es algo muy importante en la comunidad: uno no pide ayuda simplemente”, dijo Reyes.
 El segundo año de Reyes en la Universidad Estatal de San Francisco se vio interrumpido por la COVID-19, por lo que tuvo que regresar a casa y empezar a trabajar. Trabajó durante cuatro años antes de matricularse en Cal State Bakersfield para estudiar música, donde encontró un ambiente más acogedor.
 Es por eso que, como presidente del gobierno estudiantil, Reyes a menudo les dice a los líderes del campus que deben ser proactivos para ayudar a los estudiantes de primera generación. 
 El déficit crea un peso adicional sobre el profesorado latino
 Como los estudiantes tienden a buscar educadores con antecedentes similares, la brecha genera una mayor carga de trabajo para un pequeño grupo de instructores de color. Y los profesores podrían asumir esta tarea aunque no esté contemplada en su descripción de funciones.
 “Hay mucha carga cultural. Ese es el mayor problema de la falta de diversidad en la educación superior: el profesorado diverso asume más trabajo”, dijo Dirk Horn, profesor latino de ciencias políticas en Cal State Bakersfield. Esto también puede obstaculizar el apoyo a algunos aprendices, ansiosos por encontrar a alguien con quien puedan identificarse culturalmente.

 “He tenido como dos mentores latinos en total y estoy tratando de conectarme con otra, pero está muy ocupada”, dijo Isabella Cantu, una estudiante de doctorado latina que estudia sociología en UC Davis con la esperanza de unirse algún día a la facultad de Cal State.
 José Navarro, director del departamento de estudios étnicos de Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, creía cuando era estudiante que la educación podía ser transformadora, pero que cursar estudios superiores era como “entrar en una habitación muy, muy, muy oscura” en la que no podía transitar por sí solo.
 Como profesor titular, Navarro se desempeña como asesor académico y mentor, además de impartir docencia. Si bien a veces trabaja hasta altas horas de la noche o desde casa, Navarro lo considera más una necesidad que una carga.
 “Lo último que quiero es que algún estudiante de color entre, como me pasó a mí, en esa habitación completamente oscura que es el sistema universitario”, dijo Navarro.
 “El muerto entre muchos no pesa”, dijo Navarro. Dijo que así se siente en Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, donde la representación latina es limitada, pero el peso del servicio y la mentoría es más ligero cuando hay otros ahí para apoyar.
 Los latinos en Cal State tienen menos probabilidades de ocupar puestos con permanencia, que se espera que involucren asesoría académica e investigación. En otoño de 2024, los latinos representaban el 12% del profesorado con permanencia, mientras que los blancos representaban más de la mitad. Sin embargo, los blancos representaban el 20% de la población estudiantil de Cal State.
 Los profesores titulares influyen en decisiones importantes de la universidad, como la evaluación de la contratación y los ascensos del profesorado. Además, gozan de mayor estabilidad laboral, afirmó Navarro. Por otro lado, los profesores a tiempo completo cobran menos y tienen una mayor carga de trabajo docente.


Pero profesores como Horn mantienen sus puertas abiertas para sus alumnos voluntariamente.
 Horn colabora con el Senado Académico del campus, forma parte de comités y asesora a los clubes estudiantiles del campus, todo ello sin remuneración adicional. Sin posibilidad de titularidad, Horn también siente incertidumbre sobre su estabilidad laboral. Monitorea los presupuestos estatales y las tasas de matriculación para evaluar las probabilidades: en un déficit fiscal, ¿sería él el primero en ser despedido? 
 Lograr que más latinos ingresen al mundo académico
 “Creo que, más que nada, la mentoría es importante”, dijo Cantu, estudiante de UC Davis. “No solo ver la representación, sino sentir ese apoyo y tener a alguien que comprende tus antecedentes y tus orígenes”.
 Ella atribuye la mentoría que recibió de un programa nacional, la Beca de Pregrado Mellon Mays , por impulsarla a convertirse en profesora. Actualmente es becaria del Programa de Incentivos Doctorales del Rector, uno de los dos programas de Cal State que ayudan a los aspirantes a profesorado a obtener títulos avanzados.
Horn, profesor de Cal State Bakersfield, también participó en el programa de incentivos para el doctorado.Le proporcionó fondos para centrarse en los estudios mientras cursaba su doctorado en UC Irvine.
 Su camino hacia el doctorado fue accidentado. Su padre esperaba que Horn contribuyera económicamente a la familia, así que, en lugar de matricularse en la preparatoria, trabajó a tiempo completo mientras cursaba estudios secundarios para obtener su GED. Cinco años después de obtener su GED, cuando la salud de su padre se deterioraba, Horn se dio cuenta de que un título universitario podría brindarle a él y a su familia mayor estabilidad financiera. Asistió a un colegio comunitario y luego se transfirió a Cal State Bakersfield, donde encontró mentores que lo animaron a cursar estudios de posgrado.

 Horn pospuso su graduación para unirse al Programa de Logros Post-bachillerato Ronald E. McNair , financiado con fondos federales, que ayuda a preparar a estudiantes de primera generación y subrepresentados para estudios de posgrado.
 De los 35 estudiantes aceptados en el programa de incentivos de doctorado de Cal State este año académico, el 54 % son latinos, el 24 % asiáticos, el 19 % blancos y el 3 % afroamericanos, según Bentley-Smith. El programa ofrece mentoría, acceso a becas y premios financieros por miles de dólares, así como oportunidades profesionales para estudiantes que cursan un doctorado. También pueden recibir un préstamo opcional que se condona si el becario es profesor en Cal State. De los becarios anteriores del programa, el 69 % obtuvo puestos docentes en los campus de Cal State después de obtener su doctorado. 
Las contrataciones en grupo ayudan a impulsar la diversidad, cuando hay financiamiento
Algunos campus de Cal State, como Bakersfield y San Luis Obispo , han implementado la contratación por grupos (clúster) para fomentar la diversidad del profesorado. El proceso implica reclutar grupos completos de profesores con diversas experiencias y trayectorias. Ortiz-Licon, investigadora de educación superior, argumenta que esta contratación “en comunidad” aumenta el sentido de pertenencia a sus respectivos campus y fortalece la retención de estos educadores a largo plazo.
 En otoño, Sacramento State implementó su primera contratación de personal en un grupo de estudiantes, dirigida directamente a apoyar a los estudiantes latinos . Ese semestre, el 37 % de los estudiantes eran latinos, mientras que el 10 % del profesorado lo era, según la base de datos de investigación institucional de la universidad.
 Rebecca Cameron, vicerrectora interina para el éxito del profesorado en Sacramento State, dijo que la universidad buscó profesores con experiencia en tutoría, enseñanza e investigación de poblaciones latinas.
 Si bien Sacramento State contrató a 10 profesores de varios departamentos, Cameron dijo que dos de los nuevos contratados para puestos de titularidad anteriormente ocupaban puestos de profesores en la universidad.
 Cameron enfatizó la necesidad de retener a los nuevos empleados del grupo ya que a veces ha observado que los profesores que son los primeros de un grupo particular en un departamento pueden agotarse.
 “También sigue siendo muy importante que no dejemos el trabajo de inclusión [exclusivamente] en manos de personas que han identificado un interés específico en él”, dijo Cameron.

(New Bedford Light photos)This story first appeared in The New Bedford Light. Read the original version here.
When the first turbine pieces for Vineyard Wind inched into port in 2023, cranes and union labor stood at the quayside of a nearby terminal, ready and waiting to get to work. In the more than two years since, the project has kept the state-owned New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal busy and funded through a multimillion dollar lease.
But the 26-acre site wasn’t always bustling.
Eight years before Vineyard Wind entered the scene, the state finished construction on the $113 million terminal, purpose-built to support offshore wind, a buzzy industry that hadn’t yet landed. The site expected to welcome Cape Wind as the first tenant around 2015, but the Nantucket Sound project fell through after opposition. The taxpayer-funded site remained underutilized for years, and was left to find new, and smaller, revenue streams.
Amid the Trump administration’s offshore wind crackdown, it will soon find itself in a similar predicament. As the final Vineyard Wind blades trickle out, two questions emerge: What now for the offshore wind terminal, and what now for New Bedford — a city that courted millions in investment and built out its port to support an industry that’s facing an existential threat?
In a best-case scenario, experts predict construction in Massachusetts will stall for the remaining years of the Trump administration. But the worst-case scenario: the uncertainty imposed by the Trump administration in these last 12 months may be too challenging for a future pro-wind administration to overcome, freezing development longer-term.
For those on the New Bedford waterfront, their concerns are tempered with optimism. It’s a long game, and they’ve begun laying the groundwork to pivot their businesses for a few years until the next wave comes.
Still, “if the president that follows [Trump] is as hostile as he is, then we may be looking at a much longer term problem,” said New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell.
 What’s next at the Marine Commerce Terminal and Foss Terminal?

The Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, a quasi-state agency that owns and operates the New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal, is currently undertaking a $45-million expansion of the site to support the larger and heavier “next generation” turbine components. It includes the addition of a few acres.
As that work has been underway, the site has largely emptied out with 61 of Vineyard Wind’s 62 turbines now towering above the Atlantic. The project’s lease with the terminal expires in June.
Before President Donald Trump was re-elected, MassCEC expected some lull at the site before the next project, which is supposed to be SouthCoast Wind. But the lull has had two years added to it, while SouthCoast Wind finds itself under increasing threat.

Bruce Carlisle, MassCEC’s managing director of offshore wind, wouldn’t provide much detail on the agency’s plans for the intervening years at the New Bedford site, stating staff have started to “put out feelers with interested parties.”
But Mitchell wants to know.
“There is going to be an extended period between projects. [MassCEC has] to figure out how to manage the in-between,” he said. “What we don’t want to see there in the interim is scrap metal or … other bottom of the barrel materials.”
Before Vineyard Wind, the terminal hosted land-based wind turbines, offshore wind research and survey vessels, recycled steel, ferry parking, modular building components, shipping containers, and timber piles. The terminal’s revenue was also millions less before Vineyard Wind arrived.
Just a minute or two drive north of the terminal is another wind site, the New Bedford Foss Marine Terminal — a private investment that remains under construction.
More than four years ago, city and state officials gathered at the then-abandoned power station to announce the site would take on new life to support a new generation of energy: wind.
Since 2024, the terminal has berthed offshore wind support and research vessels for Vineyard Wind and other projects. But it has become a bellwether of the industry’s stalling.
The original deed required the site to commit to exclusive use for renewable energy projects. But in October, Foss and city officials amended their agreement so the site may support transportation projects and storage of breakbulk (cargo too big to fit into a container).
The new agreement also temporarily allows the Seastreak Ferry to dock at the Foss terminal while it’s displaced from the closure of the State Pier. It allows parking for ferry customers — activities that have not been part of the terminal’s mission.
“We see there will be a lull,” said Andrew Saunders, president of the Foss terminal. “We see we need to adapt to what the market is.” He stressed their preferred market is “always the offshore wind market.”
If the next generation of wind projects was moving forward now, Saunders said he’d be in front of the city’s planning board to secure approval to build the terminal’s third phase: two 30,000-square-foot warehouses for wind developers.
But without power purchase agreements between the developers and utilities, the money won’t flow.
State proceeding with second wind terminal in Salem
Mitchell wants New Bedford to be competitive with ports not just outside Massachusetts, but in it. So despite the hits to the offshore wind industry, he sees a possible opportunity for New Bedford amid some of the federal actions.
He’s talking about the Salem terminal, a public-private partnership between MassCEC, the City of Salem and Crowley (a maritime logistics company) that’s been in development since 2022 to support what was then a steady pipeline of projects to be built off the commonwealth’s coast and the Gulf of Maine.
(Kellen Riell/The New Bedford Light, Datawrapper)
That pipeline has since frozen, and the proposed terminal — on the site of a former coal plant — had $34 million in federal funding terminated this summer. (That funding amounts to about 10% of the project’s budget, per the City of Salem.)
Carlisle said the federal backing was a “critical part” of the funding mix. Salem Mayor Dominick Pangallo in November said it alone is “not entirely fatal” to the project’s completion.
Mitchell asked whether it makes sense for the state to have two staging terminals, stating New Bedford’s will be available when the industry picks back up.
“It’s no secret we in New Bedford have long been concerned about the possibility of the proposed facility in Salem competing against New Bedford,” he said. “The state has to explain why it would, at this point in the game, allow that project to proceed, given there aren’t offshore wind projects that might use New Bedford for the foreseeable future.”
But MassCEC believes the future market — as well as plans for floating wind turbines in the Gulf of Maine — warrants a second marshaling site.
“We’re taking … the medium and the long view,” said Carlisle. “We are positioning ourselves for when this industry gets some traction again.”
Because the floating turbines in the Gulf of Maine will involve different technology, Carlisle said, the state needs a different port infrastructure to support it.
Pangallo, like Mitchell, is bullish on the industry’s long-term future — and his city playing a lead role in its buildout: “The horizon we see … is over decades, not just the next couple of years.”
Pangallo said the parties are exploring a phased buildout or possible redesign of the terminal to deal with the funding loss. He said they’re also exploring “other temporary alternative uses that could support the port’s operation in the interim.”
In other words, Salem’s future terminal is already facing a predicament similar to New Bedford’s after Cape Wind fell through.
Further complicating the terminal’s future plans: its anchor tenant, New England Wind, has been targeted by the Trump administration. The federal government has asked a court for the ability to reconsider its approval of the project’s construction plan —  a permit necessary for buildout.
MassCEC in 2024 said the Salem site was expected to be operational by 2026. Not much work has progressed beyond a symbolic groundbreaking in the summer of 2024. Carlisle said he could not comment on the expected commercial operation date.
“The actions by the Trump administration certainly have led to more uncertainty on the part of developers and their ability to commit to leases, and that has impacted the long-term revenue and financing visibility for Salem,” Carlisle said. “But we are actively working with Crowley and the City of Salem as we speak on plans.”
Yearslong pause ahead
In the short to medium term, there will be “quieter times” at the ports that support offshore wind, said Kris Ohleth, director at the Special Initiative on Offshore Wind, a Delaware-based nonprofit.
“I think market and investor confidence is pretty much as low as it can possibly be,” she said, saying developers are contemplating submitting permitting documents near the end of Trump’s term — three years away.
“I would venture that the ones that started construction last year have been living in a perpetual state of fear and potentially regret that they did start,” Ohleth continued. “I can’t imagine any developer risking capital investment in this environment.”
The developers’ fears are reasonable. Two have seen their projects paused twice, costing millions in losses per day. And in December, all five projects under construction along the Atlantic coast were suspended, with the federal government citing national security concerns.
Timothy Fox, managing director at ClearView Energy Partners, believes a longer term freeze is in the realm of possibility.
“The question is… will we see the industry ramp back up after Trump leaves office?” said Fox. “Our new best-case scenario for long-term offshore wind is that this is a pause. But we’re not convinced it is. We think the administration has sought to inject so much uncertainty into the industry that there’s not going to be a lot of interest among investors and financiers.”
Because the permitting timelines are lengthy and often span two presidencies, developers have experienced pendulum swings in the approaches of Democrat and Republican administrations. This last swing has been so extreme that it could have more lasting impacts, experts say.
 New Bedford jobs on ice

Though offshore wind is touted as a clean energy alternative, Mitchell sees the industry’s role and impact in New Bedford as an economic one. And with no project to follow once Vineyard Wind concludes its high-capital construction phase, that economic spout is expected to reduce to a trickle.
Mitchell said it concerns him, but he emphasized New Bedford never was, and never will be, a wind-only port.
“New Bedford is still primarily a fishing port. … That said, the recent contribution of marshaling of the Vineyard Wind project is a not insignificant contributor to the port’s total economic output,” he said. “It’s created jobs, opportunities for small businesses in the city.”

SouthCoast Wind and New England Wind, the two projects planned next for Massachusetts, face threats of having their federal permits and approvals revoked. They missed another deadline to secure power purchase agreements with the state utilities.
Each project promises about 100 jobs for the city, Mitchell previously estimated, including union labor.
Andy Benedetto, business representative at Local 1121, which includes carpenters and millwrights, said the union was in planning talks with SouthCoast Wind on what training and standards worked best.
But in late 2025, the point person for the wind project was laid off, he said, something that’s been happening across the offshore wind industry.
“We invested millions into training people and building this workforce that now is just going to be more or less stagnant,” Benedetto said.
The National Offshore Wind Institute, a Bristol Community College site that opened in 2024 to train the union workforce and other industry members, is looking to pivot, like its waterfront neighbors.
Brianne McDonough, interim vice president for economic and business development at Bristol Community College, in an interview this fall said the school “designed the use of the building around wind,” but that it can train different industries, including oil, gas, and construction.
Some smaller-scale wind work may continue in the coming years out of New Bedford. That includes possible operations and maintenance work, and fishermen providing site and safety security for turbine installation or subsea cable laying.
Tony Alvernaz, a New Bedford scalloper, made it clear that he supports the Trump administration and opposes wind turbines being installed around fishing grounds. But, he’s also appreciative of the work he’s found with the industry.
Alvernaz, who has worked for Vineyard Wind for at least two years, recently secured another contract with a subcontractor on Orsted’s Sunrise Wind project. His fishing boat will guard a bigger vessel as it lays cable. The job was set to start in February, but that’s unclear now that the project is suspended.
“I won’t say I’m grateful for [offshore wind],” Alvernaz said. “I’m grateful for the work I guess. Who knows where I would’ve been without this extra work.”
e’s glad to see a slowdown as it will allow research to catch up: “Now you get to see these guys fully permitted finish their projects… the pros and cons will come out in the next few years.”
Mitchell shared similar sentiments, saying the Trump administration’s revisiting and reconsideration of some lease siting with more weight given to fishing interests was necessary.
The speed at which the wind industry was taking off under the Biden administration, and even before, often sparked analogies about those involved building the ship as they’re sailing it. Now that it’s slowing — if not stopping — Ohleth offered a variation.
“For a decade, our favorite expression in offshore wind was building a plane while we’re flying it. Now the plane is on the ground. That’s an opportunity,” she said. “Figure out how to get the right policies, procedures and regulations in place that enable offshore wind to be able to flourish in the next political cycle.”
In the real, not metaphorical sense, the giant vessels associated with offshore wind won’t be sidelined. The foreign jack-up ships and retrofitted barges are in high demand and will return to Europe or the south to support other projects and industries.
But the local workforce, shoreside companies, terminals and smaller fishing boats that have built offshore wind into their business plans will need to pivot.
For how long remains an open question.

Kevin Stitt speaks in the school library of Eisenhower International School in Tulsa on Oct. 2. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Gov. Kevin Stitt is expected to advocate again this year for eliminating the cap on how much Oklahoma can spend to help children attend private schools, though the state hasn’t hit its current limit.
With the 2026 legislative session set to begin Feb. 2, Stitt remains committed to removing the $250 million spending cap on the Parental Choice Tax Credit program, his press secretary Tevis Hillis told Oklahoma Voice. The tax credits provide $5,000 to $7,500 to families to offset the cost of private school tuition and fees.
“Demand far exceeds current funding, leaving families on waitlists,” Hillis said. “His goal is simple: let more kids attend the school of their parents’ choice.”
However, the Oklahoma Tax Commission confirmed to Oklahoma Voice it hasn’t had to turn away any applicants this school year because of the budget limit. 
The Tax Commission reported last week that nearly $1 million in tax credits were still available for the 2025-26 school year with under two weeks left before the application window closes. Families have been able to apply since Feb. 18 of last year, according to the commission’s website.
When asked for clarification, Hillis said her reference to waitlists “pertains to students seeking those schooling options.”
The Oklahoma Legislature would have to agree to adjust the program’s spending cap, but lawmakers didn’t give even a committee hearing to a Senate bill last year that sought to remove the limit entirely. State officials estimated the policy would cost the state $13 million.
The state Senate’s top leader has continued to express reservations about uncapping the program.
“Any changes must be done responsibly,” Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, said in a statement this week. “Removing the cap entirely at this time could lead to unintended consequences and strain the state’s ability to ensure the program is meeting its intended purpose. Our priority is making sure those who need help the most are the primary beneficiaries.”

House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, didn’t return a request for comment.
The state is projected to have $692 million less to spend than the year before, raising doubts about the feasibility of major new investments.
Stitt first advocated for eliminating the maximum spending limit on the Parental Choice Tax Credits in his state budget proposal last year. In a recent guest column in The Oklahoman, the governor pledged he would work this year to make the tax credits available to more families.
So far, only one new bill has been filed that would expand the program. Senate Bill 1389 from Sen. Julie Daniels, R-Bartlesville, would allow the spending limit to increase by 20% if at least 90% of the available funds are claimed.
Daniels filed last year’s bill to completely remove the spending cap. She said her new legislation is a “much more fiscally conservative, responsible way to go.”
“My bill this year allows us to grow the program in a responsible, measured way because we now see that it is very successful, and more Oklahoma families are choosing to take advantage of it,” Daniels said. “We should allow that credit limit to increase gradually as participation increases.”

Stitt and Republican lawmakers have celebrated the Parental Choice Tax Credit program, created in 2023, as a way to help financially disadvantaged families leave public schools and access the private school of their choice. 
Legislative Democrats have long criticized the policy for giving funds to wealthy families and for diverting millions of dollars that they say should instead go to public schools, which educate the vast majority of Oklahoma students.
Last week’s report from the Tax Commission shows the state so far has spent $249 million this school year on tax credits for 39,485 students. Just over 3,700 of those students had attended a public school the semester before the 2025-26 academic year, according to the report.
Students who qualified for the $7,500 maximum tax credit made up the largest share, 28.4%, of awarded applicants, according to an Oklahoma Voice analysis. These are children from households that earn no more than $75,000 a year or receive income-based government benefits like SNAP and Medicaid.
The state spent $79.6 million on private school tax credits for these students. 
The second-most-awarded group of applications, 27.3%, came from families with a yearly income between $75,001 and $150,000. These households, which qualify for $7,000 per student, collectively received more than $72 million from the program.
Households earning over $250,000 a year were the third-most common, representing 24.5% of total recipients. Oklahoma spent $48 million this school year to support the private school costs of these families, who qualify for $5,000 per student.

First Lady Casey DeSantis said the state tested 24 infant formulas and found that 16 contained heavy metal or chemicals. The samples were obtained through a variety of means, including ordering online, to make sure that it was “not a one-off shipment.”
The state has placed the testing results on a website called exposingfoodtoxins.com and those results show that the heavy metals included mercury, arsenic, lead, and cadmium. The brands tested include several manufactured by national industry leaders.
Infant formulas are not regulated by the state, but Casey DeSantis said it is important Florida and other states do independent testing to “drive accountability.”
“Parents should not be expected to verify the integrity of products on their own,” she said.

The push by Florida to test infant formula comes several months after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. directed the Food and Drug Administration to look at ingredients used in infant formula. Before he joined the administration of President Donald Trump, Kennedy promised to look at whether there were toxic metals in infant formula.
The first lady discussed the infant formula testing during an event in Bartow that also featured Gov. Ron DeSantis and State Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo.
In his remarks, Ladapo contended the results produced an “understatement of the risk” because infants can be subject to greater harm given their size, weight, and developmental stage.
He added that, of the items tested, “mercury is probably one of the most toxic things you can put in a person’s body.”
Gov. DeSantis only briefly touched on the infant formula testing results, but called the effort part of Florida’s efforts to bring “transparency” to medicine and food. He did briefly repeat his support for a bill that would bar physicians from refusing to treat someone if that person has refused to get vaccinated.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/infant_john-moore_getty-images.jpg,,,2026-01-09 13:59:16.766680

Un juez de inmigración concedió la libertad bajo fianza a Idris Demirtas, pero eso no fue suficiente para reunirlo con su esposa en San Diego. 


This article is also available in English. Read it here.
Un inmigrante turco que huyó de su país después de ser torturado ahora está en casa con su esposa en San Diego después de haber estado detenido durante aproximadamente siete semanas por las autoridades estadounidenses.
 Idris Demirtas , de 25 años, fue liberado solo después de que una jueza federal del Distrito Sur de California concediera un recurso de hábeas corpus, al determinar que su detención era injustificada. Una jueza de inmigración emitió un fallo a favor de Demirtas una semana antes, pero supeditó el fallo a un proceso judicial federal.
 Su arresto en un control migratorio rutinario y su detención durante 48 días reflejaron algunas de las tácticas de aplicación de la línea dura de la administración Trump desde que el republicano asumió el cargo hace un año y se comprometió a deportar a un millón de personas por año.
“Crecí mucho en este proceso, pero perdimos mucho emocional y mentalmente”, dijo Mae Bovenzi, la esposa de Demirtas. “Espero que nuestra salud mental se normalice. Siento que nos han desinformado mucho y he visto con mis propios ojos cómo nos están arrebatando los derechos constitucionales”.
La pareja, que se casó en mayo, se perdió su primera temporada navideña juntos debido a la terrible experiencia, pero ahora planean celebrar a su manera, dijo Bovenzi. Añadió que estaba agradecida por todo el apoyo que recibió su familia.
“Mi cuerpo no quería dormirse anoche porque tenía miedo de soñar que estaba de nuevo en la cárcel”, dijo Demirtas sobre su primera noche en casa tras siete semanas encarcelado.
 Demirtas fue arrestado el 20 de noviembre cuando cumplió con una orden de comparecer a un registro de rutina del ICE en San Diego en el tribunal federal Edward Schwartz del centro de la ciudad.
 Fue uno de los cientos de personas que fueron arrestadas en California el año pasado al comparecer en controles de inmigración o audiencias judiciales. Sus antecedentes habrían hecho improbable su detención durante el gobierno de Biden. Está casado con una ciudadana estadounidense y tiene una solicitud de residencia permanente pendiente. No tiene antecedentes penales, según confirmó un abogado del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional durante una audiencia de fianza la semana pasada. Proviene de un país con un historial de derechos humanos criticado por el Departamento de Estado y llegó a Estados Unidos tras huir de la persecución religiosa. Declaró en documentos judiciales que fue torturado en Turquía debido a sus creencias religiosas.
 A pesar de esos antecedentes y de que un juez de inmigración dictaminó que podría ser liberado bajo fianza el 30 de diciembre, Demirtas permaneció detenido en el Centro de Detención de Otay Mesa hasta que el juez de distrito concedió su petición de hábeas corpus y fue liberado el martes por la noche.
 Los abogados recurren cada vez más a los tribunales federales para conseguir la liberación de sus clientes debido a las interrupciones en el sistema judicial de inmigración. La administración Trump ha despedido a más de 100 jueces de inmigración en todo el país, según la Asociación Nacional de Jueces de Inmigración.
En California, más de una cuarta parte de los jueces federales de inmigración han sido despedidos, jubilados o renunciaron desde la toma de posesión de Trump en enero de 2025. En San Francisco, al menos 12 jueces de inmigración han sido despedidos o se han quedado sin explicaciones claras, lo que agrava un atraso de 100,000 casos en la región que cubre.
Un portavoz de la Oficina Ejecutiva de Revisión de Inmigración, que supervisa los tribunales, dijo que ese despacho no hace comentarios sobre asuntos de personal.
‘Sistema implacable’
 En julio de 2025, la administración Trump emitió una directiva que requería la detención obligatoria para casi todos los no ciudadanos que ingresaran a Estados Unidos sin autorización.
 “Dado lo implacable que es el sistema migratorio actual, hay personas importantes que simplemente se dan por vencidas”, dijo Matthew Holt, abogado de inmigración de Demirtas. “Es triste verlo después de los sacrificios generacionales que han hecho”.
 Holt y otros abogados han dicho que el nuevo sistema de detener a más personas y no dejarlas salir bajo fianza o libertad condicional es como una “guerra de desgaste”, una estrategia militar en la que un bando desgasta al otro agotando sus recursos y su moral.
 En septiembre, unos 7079 casos judiciales de inmigración en todo el país finalizaron con una salida voluntaria, que permite a una persona salir del país dentro de un plazo determinado y suele conllevar sanciones menores que una orden de deportación. Esta es la cifra más alta jamás registrada en un solo mes, según datos del Centro de Acceso a Registros Transaccionales de la Universidad de Syracuse, que contiene información sobre casos desde 1997. En California, el total fue de 408.
 “Personalmente, he visto a personas con argumentos válidos, o que podrían ser válidos, decir antes de la audiencia, antes de su testimonio: ‘Quiero una orden de deportación. Quiero irme. No puedo soportarlo más'”, dijo Jeremiah Johnson, ex juez de inmigración de San Francisco, quien fue despedido el 21 de noviembre por correo electrónico sin explicación. 
 Jueces federales fallan en contra de la detención
 Un portavoz del Departamento de Justicia declinó hacer comentarios. Anteriormente, la subsecretaria del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional, Tricia McLaughlin, había insistido en que Demirtas había entrado al país ilegalmente.
“Para ser claros, tener una solicitud pendiente con USCIS o la posibilidad de ser elegible para una tarjeta de residencia (green card)  no le otorga a nadie estatus legal”, dijo McLaughlin sobre el caso.
 Un documento presupuestario del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional de 2024 dice que a ICE le cuesta en promedio $217 por día detener a alguien en San Diego, lo que significa que los contribuyentes estadounidenses pagaron alrededor de $10,416 para que Demirtas fuera detenido antes de que la agencia finalmente aceptara liberarlo.
 Antes del segundo mandato del presidente Donald Trump, las demandas federales conocidas como “habeas corpus” no se utilizaban con regularidad en casos de inmigración. El “habeas corpus” es el derecho constitucional que garantiza que las personas tengan la oportunidad de impugnar su encarcelamiento ante un juez.
 En 2025, se presentaron cientos de casos de hábeas corpus en el Distrito Sur de California, y miles de ellos se presentaron para inmigrantes detenidos en todo el país. En lo que va de 2026, ya se han presentado alrededor de una docena de casos similares en el Distrito Sur de California, según habeasdockets.org , un sitio web que da seguimiento a este tipo de solicitudes.
 Los jueces federales han rechazado sistemáticamente la política de detención obligatoria de Trump. En una presentación reciente en el Distrito Sur de Nueva York , el juez federal de distrito Lewis A. Kaplan señaló que los extranjeros han ganado sus peticiones de hábeas corpus en 350 de 362 casos en tribunales federales de distrito. Escribió que “160 jueces diferentes, en aproximadamente 50 tribunales diferentes repartidos por todo Estados Unidos”, dictaron las sentencias. 
 Nuevas vacantes para ‘jueces de deportación’
 Los tribunales de inmigración operan bajo la jurisdicción del poder ejecutivo, no del poder judicial independiente que supervisa los tribunales federales. Los tribunales dependen del Departamento de Justicia, lo que otorga a la administración Trump mayor autoridad sobre los jueces de inmigración. A diferencia de los tribunales penales, no se asignan abogados a quienes no pueden costear una representación legal.
 El Departamento de Justicia comenzó recientemente a anunciar puestos vacantes para “jueces de deportación”, particularmente para empleados ubicados en San Francisco, Santa Ana, Sacramento y Los Ángeles, donde se invita a los solicitantes a “combatir el fraude y garantizar que aquellos que buscan explotar las vulnerabilidades de nuestro sistema de inmigración no tengan éxito”.
 Un portavoz del Departamento de Justicia dijo que el esfuerzo tenía como objetivo “restaurar la integridad de nuestro sistema de inmigración”.
 “Después de cuatro años de que la Administración Biden obligara a los tribunales de inmigración a implementar una amnistía de facto para cientos de miles de extranjeros, este Departamento de Justicia está restaurando la integridad de nuestro sistema de inmigración y alienta a los profesionales legales talentosos a unirse a nuestra misión de proteger la seguridad nacional y la seguridad pública”, escribió en una declaración enviada por correo electrónico.
 La administración Trump también ha asignado temporalmente a abogados militares para que actúen como jueces en casos de inmigración, lo que según algunos expertos podría violar el posse comitatus, la ley del siglo XIX que define lo que los militares pueden hacer en suelo estadounidense.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/010525-Idris-Demirtas-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-09 13:12:18.794599

(File photo by Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)The U.S. Department of Transportation is threatening to withhold nearly $50 million in federal funding from North Carolina if the state refuses to revoke commercial driver’s licenses the department contends were illegally issued to immigrant drivers.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy issued a statement Thursday contending 54% of the state’s non-domiciled commercial driver’s licenses reviewed by the Federal Motor Carrier Administration  (FMCSA) were issued illegally.
Such licenses are intended to be issued to foreign nationals who are in the United States legally. Canadians and Mexicans may drive in the U.S. with their home country’s licenses for temporary visits.
“North Carolina’s failure to follow the rules isn’t just shameful – it’s dangerous,” Duffy said in a statement. “I’m calling on state leadership to immediately remove these dangerous drivers from our roads and clean up their system.”
Duffy’s statement comes amid an ongoing nationwide audit of states’ truck licensing systems by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA).
North Carolina must fix its licensing “failures” and “immediately revoke” all illegally issued licenses, federal officials said.
“The level of noncompliance in North Carolina is egregious,” said FMCSA Administrator Derek D. Barrs. “Under Secretary [Sean] Duffy, we will not hesitate to hold states accountable and protect the American people.”
In a letter to Gov. Josh Stein, Barrs said the illegal licenses were discovered during an annual program review of the state CDL program initiated by his administration last August.
Barrs said his administration found that the NC Department of Transportation, Division of Motor Vehicles issued:

Non-domiciled CDLs that extend beyond the expiration of drivers’ lawful presence in the United States.
Non-domiciled CDLs to citizens of Mexico not present in the United States under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
Non-domiciled CDLs without providing evidence that it verified the driver’s lawful presence in the United States.

The DMV shared this statement when asked to comment on the letter:
“NCDMV is committed to upholding safety and integrity in our licensing processes,” the agency said. “We have been collaborating closely with our federal partners for several months to resolve these matters that are impacting many U.S. states.”
U.S. Sen. Ted Budd, a Republican from Davie County, posted on  X that the “North Carolina DMV has been a complete disaster, from long wait times to paperwork issues, and beyond” under the previous administration.
“I hope Governor Stein and the @NCDOT will quickly clean up this mess left to them by the previous administration and get North Carolina back into compliance as soon as possible,” Budd posted.
To avoid losing federal funding, Duffy said the North Carolina DMV must take the following corrective actions:

Immediately pause issuance of non-domiciled CDLs
Identify all unexpired non-domiciled CDLs that fail to comply with FMCSA regulations.
Revoke and reissue all noncompliant non-domiciled CDLs if they comply with the federal requirements.
Conduct a comprehensive internal audit to identify all procedural and programming errors, training and quality assurance problems, insufficient policies and practices, and other issues that have resulted in the issuance of non-domiciled CDLs that did not meet federal rules.

(Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)For weeks after hundreds of U.S. Border Patrol agents were deployed to New Orleans as part of the Catahoula Crunch immigration crackdown, one Metairie woman and her husband — both of them undocumented immigrants from Honduras — lived in isolation, barely leaving the house.
Each time they leave, the woman said, they risk arrest, detention and deportation. She asked not to be identified for fear of being targeted by immigration enforcement agents. (Verite News previously interviewed the woman in August.) Her husband, a construction worker, stopped going to work entirely for the first few weeks of December, after the beginning of the U.S. Border Patrol surge in New Orleans.
Despite the risk, he has since returned to work, she said, because they need the money.
“He needs to go out and work, we have rent to pay,” she said in a message on WhatsApp in December.
“My husband works alone when he is sure that there is not much movement on the streets,” another message, sent in January, said.
The couple worry about what would happen to their child — a 4-year old U.S. citizen — if they do get picked up. So they devised a backup plan — a notarized letter that names a close friend they trust as a temporary guardian for their son, also called “provisional custody by mandate.” The letter, which was drafted in March, authorizes the friend to take the child to and from school, to take him to his medical appointments and, if necessary, to travel with him out of the country.
“Having this Plan B gives me peace of mind, knowing that no matter what happens my child will be protected and cared for,” the mother told Verite News. “This decision was made with my child’s safety and stability in mind.”
As President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown continues, a growing number of immigrant parents — even some with legal status in the U.S. — across the New Orleans metro region are making such provisions to protect their children’s well-being, immigrant rights groups told Verite News.
There is no publicly available data to show how many temporary guardianship arrangements have been created in Louisiana since Donald Trump’s second presidential inauguration or since the “Catahoula Crunch” operation began in December because these mandates are private legal documents, not court orders. But representatives from local organizations that support Latino and immigrant communities, including Puentes New Orleans and Familias Unidas en Accion said they have seen a sharp increase in families requesting help with making provisional custody arrangements.
Leticia Casildo, executive director of Familias Unidas, said before 2025, her organization encouraged undocumented parents to create guardianship arrangements for their children should they ever be detained, but back then, the group had few takers.
“Maybe we would have 10 people sign up in one year,” Casildo said.
Last year, however, Casildo said more than 200 families requested help to arrange for temporary guardianship. Since Catahoula Crunch launched, Casildo said, Familias Unidas has been arranging for volunteer notaries to visit peoples’ homes to assist with getting these legal documents signed because many are afraid to leave their residences.
Suma Setty, a senior analyst of policies affecting immigrant families at the Center for Law and Social Policy,  said her organization has received a “huge increase” in inquiries about temporary guardianship from local advocates and child care providers.
“The reason why these are becoming more popular is because parents are terrified” of what could happen if an arrangement is not in place, Setty told Verite News in a phone interview Thursday.
In April, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents deported two mothers from Honduras, and their U.S. citizen children, after they were taken into custody at routine check-ins with operators of the agency’s immigrant surveillance program. A lawsuit filed in August on behalf of both families alleged that the mothers were not given the opportunity to arrange care for their U.S. citizen children, including one boy who was in treatment for stage 4 cancer.
In July, ICE issued a policy directive instructing officials to designate a “detained parent coordinator” and to “facilitate required participation in family court, child welfare, or guardianship proceedings, and communication with child welfare services” when parents or legal guardians of minors or incapacitated adult dependents are detained. ICE officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this article.
The Center for Law and Social Policy interviewed undocumented immigrant parents in six states last year. Setty said the parents who already had agreements in place were people with large social networks that included adults with legal status in the U.S. who they trusted. She stressed the importance for advocates to connect immigrant parents who don’t have those networks with people who they can build trust with.
Although temporary guardianship agreements vary from state to state, Setty said they generally allow for another adult to make decisions about children’s education, medical care and sometimes finances, while they are separated from their parents.
“These agreements are critically important for immigrant parents to ensure the best possible care for their children,” Setty said.
Arthur Ago, director of strategic litigation and advocacy at the Southern Poverty Law Center, who focuses on education and youth policy, acknowledged that such arrangements are often the best way to guarantee a child’s security when a parent is taken into immigration custody, he wishes that parents were not being forced to make them. Sudden changes in a child’s family structure have long-lasting negative consequences, he said.
“You are going to end up with children that could potentially be socially isolated within that new guardian unit, let alone if they have to move school districts,” Ago said. “That isolation destroys any sense of security and hope for children. … And that is going to set them back years.”
Originally from Guatemala, Mayra, a New Orleans mother of three with work authorization in the U.S., said she worries about how the “persecution” of immigrants is affecting her three children. Her two daughters are glued to the social media accounts of local immigrants rights activists, watching to see where Border Patrol and ICE agents are showing up next. Whenever there are alerts that agents are in their community, her kids beg her not to go outside, she said. And when she goes to work as a cleaner, they inundate her with phone calls to make sure she’s safe and will return home.
“I think the fear that they feel is more than I feel,” Mayra, who asked Verite News to use her first name only because she fears being targeted by immigration enforcement, said in Spanish, speaking through an interpreter. “After all this [is over] I don’t think they’re gonna be the same.”
When the Border Patrol operation began in New Orleans Mayra sat her daughters — ages 10 and 13 — and her 18-year-old son down to tell them the plan she’d come up with if she were to be detained. The conversation was difficult, she said. When she told her son he’d have to sell her car to make sure they had enough money to get by without her, at least for a while, the children burst into tears.
But the first thing they’d have to do, she said, was call Elizabeth, a social worker they’d known since her youngest daughter was a baby. Elizabeth had agreed to take care of the kids if Mayra were to get picked up.
Mayra didn’t make a formal arrangement with Elizabeth. Since her eldest son is 18, he would be able to maintain legal guardianship of his younger siblings. And with his permission, Elizabeth, who asked to be identified only by her middle name, would do the actual work of taking care of them.
Mayra said she trusts Elizabeth — who has previously taken the children to Guatemala to visit their family members there — completely.
Mayra and Elizabeth have both spoken about preparing her children to be independent in case they’re separated from their mother.
“It’s out of necessity, they need to be able to survive without [her],” Elizabeth, who said she is honored that Mayra asked her to watch over her children, said. “[It’s] deeply sad for the orientation for your kids to have to shift in that way.”

Free.,"Thune, GOP senators at the border tout big hiring boost for immigration crackdown",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/thune-gop-senators-border-tout-big-hiring-boost-immigration-crackdown,,"WASHINGTON — Senate Majority Leader John Thune, joined at the U.S.-Mexico border Friday by a handful of other Republican senators, highlighted the president’s signature tax cuts and spending package passed last year that provided billions for immigration enforcement.The press conference in McAllen, Texas, came after a federal immigration officer shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday, and two people were shot by Border Patrol agents late Thursday in Portland, Oregon.Thune, a South Dakota Republican, touted how the tax cuts and spending package signed into law last summer also provided “for additional reinforcements,” such as the hiring of more Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. On Jan. 3, ICE announced it hired 12,000 new officers, more than doubling its force from 10,000 agents to 22,000. Thousands more are set to be hired.The GOP-passed bill also included $4.1 billion for Customs and Border Protection to hire 5,000 customs officers and 3,000 Border Patrol agents over the next four years.Thune said because migration at the southern border has slowed, the time has come for President Donald Trump to shift his focus to immigration reform. CBP data from November, the most recent available, shows total apprehensions at the southwest border slowed to 7,350 that month.“I think President Trump is probably the president best equipped to lead the effort to reform immigration law in his country in a way that it creates, again, those better paying jobs, opportunities for people who come to the country legally,” Thune said. “We are a nation of immigrants, but we're also a nation of laws, and we have to make sure we're enforcing our laws, and that's where it starts.”The Trump administration has continued with its aggressive mass deportation efforts throughout the interior of the country and has moved to revoke the legal status of more than 1.5 million immigrants since taking office last January. Thune added that the GOP bill, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill, also provided billions for border security.“As a result of the passage of the One Big, Beautiful bill … we got more resources down here, not only for physical infrastructure, for the wall, but for also that virtual infrastructure, for technology and counter drone technology, all those sorts of things that make it possible for the Border Patrol to do their job,” he said.Thune was joined by Whip John Barrasso of Wyoming and Sens. John Cornyn of Texas, Ashley Moody of Florida, Jon Husted of Ohio, Mike Rounds of South Dakota and Pete Ricketts of Nebraska.Rounds said that under the Trump administration the southern border has undergone “a remarkable transformation.” “There is no such thing as a country that can be a superpower, or, for that matter, be free if they can't defend their own borders,” Rounds said. Cornyn also highlighted how the bill will reimburse, up to $13.5 billion, those border states who have spent money on immigration enforcement. He said of that money, Texas will get $11 billion.",,,,2026-01-09 12:57:21.783382

National Popcorn Day is celebrated annnually on January 19th.
Some bucket list moments involve big trips or long-term goals, but others are delightfully simple. Going to the movies with a bucket of fresh popcorn definitely qualifies, and this National Popcorn Day, Penn Cinema is giving movie lovers a fun and flavorful way to check that moment off the list.
National Popcorn Day, celebrated annually on January 19, spotlights one of America’s most iconic movie snacks, with roots tracing back thousands of years to Indigenous cultures in the Southwest. From movie theaters to community events across Delaware, popcorn remains a simple, crunchy favorite; sometimes the best traditions come with a little butter and a lot of pop.
The Penn Cinema location on the Wilmington Riverfront is celebrating National Popcorn Day with a special bring your own bucket promotion. On January 18 and 19, moviegoers can bring their own bucket and have it filled with popcorn for just $5, adding a playful twist to a classic moviegoing tradition.
There are a few important guidelines guests should know before heading out. Buckets must be clean and watertight, and the maximum fill is limited to 400 ounces. The promotion is available while supplies last, so planning an earlier showtime may help ensure fans can take advantage of the deal.
The bucket fill turns an everyday snack into a shared experience and invites moviegoers to get a little creative. Some may bring a favorite reusable popcorn tub, while others might dust off a souvenir bucket from a past movie night. The rules are simple, and the fun comes from making the experience your own.
National Popcorn Day is also a reminder that bucket list moments do not have to be complicated. Catching a movie you have been meaning to see, sharing popcorn with friends or family, or carving out time to enjoy the big screen can be just as satisfying as checking off something much bigger.
Located along the Wilmington Riverfront, Penn Cinema makes it easy to turn a movie night into a full evening out. Many visitors pair a film with dining or a walk along the waterfront, while others make the theater the main destination. The Riverfront setting adds to the appeal, especially during the winter months when indoor entertainment takes center stage.
With a rotating lineup of current releases, Penn Cinema continues to offer audiences the opportunity to experience movies the way they were meant to be seen. Comfortable seating, large screens, and a shared audience all contribute to the magic that keeps people coming back to the theater.
As winter routines settle in and calendars fill up, National Popcorn Day offers a reason to slow down and enjoy something familiar. A movie ticket, a bucket of popcorn, and a couple of hours to escape into a story might be one of the easiest bucket list items to check off this year.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The state auditor called out a publicly-funded historical society in western Nebraska for potential misuse of a debit card, including the purchase of a pink oil burner from a Colorado vape shop.
A tip prompted the state probe of the Plains Historical Society in Kimball County, and results of that financial review led to a nine-page letter this week to the society and its board president, Jack Shaw.

Shaw’s daughter, Lisa, whom the audit team identified as a former board member of the historical society, was a target of the review. The state report alleges that Lisa Shaw persuaded the board to start using a debit card.
According to the state audit team, she made 54 purchases with the debit card during a roughly six-week period in 2024 totaling $1,386 for “apparently personal purposes.” The report itemized buys from places including a Kwik Stop, cafes, a Sugar Shack, diners, gas stations and a parking lot.
The audit team emphasized a $31 transaction at a vape and glass shop that included the pink-colored oil burner. A copy of a receipt and photos of the store were included in the report, along with a remark questioning “whether any of the products listed above could possibly be considered a reasonable or allowable expenditure of [historical] society funds.”
 Findings go to law enforcement

Debit card purchases were made from the historical society’s general fund bank account, which contains a mix of public and non-public funds. The audit team said the society did not appear to be accounting for the funds separately. 
Thus, it said, all the money should be considered restricted under state law to certain uses, such as construction of historical buildings, purchase of property of historical significance and related maintenance and storage.
State Auditor Mike Foley’s team called the situation concerning, regardless of whether reimbursement was made for “suspect charges.” The report noted that the board chairman, Jack Shaw, reimbursed the society in September 2024 for the questionable purchases. The debit card also was canceled.
The audit report said the society’s board is responsible for financial accountability and control over operations, including ensuring that public funds are spent according to state law. Foley’s office turned over its findings to the Nebraska Attorney General and Kimball County Attorney for review. 
The Shaws could not be reached for comment, but a board member, speaking on background, said he had discovered and reported potential misuse of the debit card to the local police department back in 2024. He said Jack Shaw reimbursed the society from his personal funds and that Lisa Shaw was voted off the board.
He said board members take the museum and preservation of history “very seriously and they want to keep it going.”

The audit report included a written response from Jack Shaw. He said the society’s governing board on Dec. 4, 2025, voted to reaffirm its decision to stop using a debit card and to open a separate account for non-restricted funds and to prohibit cash withdrawals except when specific requirements are met. He also included a letter to the entity’s bank laying out stricter procedures for cash withdrawals. 
Foley’s team noted in its report that debit cards do not provide as much fraud protection as credit cards and other more secure forms of payment and urged a more formal written policy outlining procedures for safeguarding public assets.
While Lisa Shaw is identified in the report as a former board member, Foley said she was an active member at the time of the questionable purchases. 
 ‘Get it right’ 

Listed as a public benefit nonprofit corporation established in 1957, the historical society owns and operates the Plains Historical Society Museum in Kimball. State law authorizes counties to grant such historical societies an annual amount of general tax funds for certain purposes, Foley’s office said.
With roughly 2,700 units of government under the watch of the state auditor, Foley said a little-known historical society ordinarily wouldn’t catch his attention. He said the tipster was helpful and that such examinations often have “a ripple effect” in sending a message for small and large governmental entities to be watchful.
“You’ve got to get it right,” he said. “It might be your time.”

(Photo courtesy of South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks)Custer State Park’s main highways and trails are open to visitors after last month’s high-speed winds swept through western South Dakota, but officials are warning visitors to stay aware of their surroundings.
Cleanup crews have been working to remove fallen trees and repair damages to park facilities, but there are still cracked trees that may be cause for concern, according to Matt Snyder, a parks regional supervisor for western South Dakota.
Though the park is open, Snyder is encouraging visitors to “be cognizant.”
“Be looking up ahead, up above you and see what’s going on. If you hear the winds blowing or something like that, I’d probably stay off the trails that day,” Snyder said. “But, if you do find yourself out there, just be looking above your head and see what’s going on, and just stay safe.”
Governor seeks federal help for damages from December wind storm

A western South Dakota windstorm last month damaged Custer State Park’s campgrounds, trees, park facilities and power systems.
Wind gusts were as high as 101 miles per hour between Dec. 17 and 18, according to the National Weather Service. The storm downed thousands of mature trees, tore through facilities and campgrounds and left Custer State Park without power for nearly a week.
The park lost one camping cabin to the storm, Snyder said, which is the most substantial damage. Other damage can be fixed.
“From a structural standpoint, everything’s going to be fine,” he said. “It’s just a matter of getting the repairs done.”
Snyder said 65 workers from across state departments including Transportation, Wildland Fire and an inmate crew helped to cut through some of the fallen trees last week, especially those blocking roadways and hiking trails.
Gov. Larry Rhoden announced Wednesday he’s asked the federal government for help to repair public property across the region. Park leaders are still working through the Office of Emergency Management to determine the final cost of repairs at Custer State Park.
Park officials said lodges and cabins have been minimally impacted, without any serious impacts on guests. They plan to have damaged facilities open and ready for visitors again in April.

Jan. 9, 2026 | ScreenshotDetroit Mayor Mary Sheffield took a final victory lap on Friday with an investiture ceremony at the Detroit Opera House that, at times, felt more like church and a gospel concert than your average swearing-in for a government official.
Sheffield, the daughter and granddaughter of renowned pastors and civil rights leaders and an accomplished politician in her own right, gathered the city’s elected officials, several faith leaders and a large audience of friends and community members to extol her gratitude to the city for electing her in a November 2025 landslide.
“Throughout this journey, I didn’t always know every step ahead, but I trusted the calling, and I kept moving forward. And if this means anything, this moment today, I hope that it reminds every Detroiter of this truth,” Sheffield said. “That every single person gathered here today, every Detroiter across this city, has a purpose, has a unique gift, one that no one else can offer in quite the same way. And when we choose to walk in that purpose, when we choose faith over fear, courage over doubt, and we choose to say yes, even when the path is not always clear, extraordinary things can happen.”
Mary Sheffield makes history: Detroit elects first woman mayor

The event was headlined by Sheffield’s investiture but also featured a swearing in ceremony for newly elected or reelected members of the Wayne County Board of Commissioners, the Detroit City Council and Detroit Clerk Janice Winfrey.
But it was certainly Sheffield who was in the spotlight, with poets, gospel singers, faith leaders and judges each offering their support, encouragement and blessings to the new mayor as she charts a path forward.
Sheffield thanked her family and close allies, as well as Mike Duggan, the city’s former mayor, for his role in helping the city progress. Now, it will be Sheffield’s job to keep that momentum and to help the city rise even higher, which is consequentially the slogan of her transition team as she gets settled.
“In this next chapter, we draw our strength from the prayers, the purpose and the power of generations who came before us; those who understood that improving the quality of life for all Detroiters is not the work of one leader but the responsibility of an entire city,” Sheffield said. “Here in Detroit, Dr. King first shared his dream, calling this city in this nation to become a beloved community. And that call is still relevant today, and it calls on all of us, not just those in elected office, but every resident, every community leader, every neighborhood, every institution that is gathered here today to do our part, Detroit, our futures are bound together.”
In another sign that it was a new day in Detroit’s history, Sheffield said that progress in her administration will be measured by who it helps along the way. In that vein, Sheffield said progress would be real only when it “reaches every block, every family, in every community in this city.”
“In this administration, every voice will guide our path, including voices that, for too often, have been overlooked. We will work every single day to build a Detroit that works for everyone,” Sheffield said, “by strengthening and investing in our neighborhoods, expanding access to programs and city services, and ensuring that every Detroiter truly feels the resurgence of our city.”
Sheffield said those goals will focus on safe and affordable housing, good-paying jobs that support families, reliable transit that connects Detroiters to opportunities and safety rooted in prevention and accountability so families feel safe in their neighborhoods and children are protected.
“We will value the hard work of labor, champion our legacy in our start up businesses and make Detroit the best place to start and grow a business,” Sheffield added. And lastly, we will empower and support our young people. That deserves a round of applause. I am energized by the generations of our youth that are rising across this city discovering their purpose right here at home, just as I did. We must continue to invest in their growth and build a Detroit where young people can dream without limits and see those dreams take shape right here at home.”

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-09 17:15:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Why is Simpson County’s chronic absenteeism rate so high? School district officials want to know how to help,Leonardo Bevilacqua and Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/09/simpson-county-seeks-truancy-fix/,Magee High School principal Duriel Banks walks through a neighborhood for an initiative that addresses truancy.,"PINOLA — Aaron Thompson drives his two elementary-aged children to school each day, but only when they aren’t sick or the road isn’t flooded. The family of four lives off a ragged stretch of concrete bounded on one side by a hunting trail and, on the other, by a worn bridge dotted with orange traffic cones.
Thompson admits that his kids are likely what the Mississippi Department of Education describes as “chronically absent,” a term for students who miss 18 or more days of instruction in a school year. Simpson County School District has the third-largest chronically absent population of any school district in the state, behind Moss Point School District and Claiborne County School District. 
The problem is statewide — chronic absenteeism rates in Mississippi surged from 13% in the 2017-18 academic year to 28% in 2024-25. But a closer look in Simpson County reveals a complicated story about student absenteeism.
Like most other counties where 75% or more of children require free and reduced lunch, almost half of students are considered chronically absent in Simpson County. The reasons vary by family, with explanations oftentimes exposing a fraying social safety net now relying on younger helpers around the house to take care of elderly relatives and toddlers and teenage laborers in town, who work to contribute to their household income. 
Aaron Thompson, a father in Simpson County, says he has replaced the front end of his car three times in the last four years because of wear and tear from driving on pockmarked roads.

Pinola, which lies in the southern half of Simpson County, is a community so rural that some of its roads don’t appear on Google Maps.
“Out here in the sticks it’s not so bad,” Thompson said. But he estimates that he has replaced the front end of his car three times in the last four years.
Chronic absenteeism is “a national problem,” Simpson County School District Superintendent Robert Sanders said. “I would like parents to know that we want to work alongside them to make sure their kids can learn.”
More than the robocall
Sanders took over Simpson County School District in July and was surprised to learn in October that his district had the third-highest rate of chronic absenteeism in the state. He gathered his principals and implored them to come up with an attendance strategy that would work for their students.

Magee High School Principal Jammal Banks, along with a school resource officer and the district communications professional, visited homes of students who hadn’t shown up for classes. Of Simpson County schools, Magee High had the highest rate of absenteeism at 67.2%. 
The group’s three door-knocking trips acted as a fact-finding mission and an opportunity for administrators to reach out in a friendly manner before truancy officers and the youth court got involved. Under the state’s compulsory attendance law, parents and guardians can be charged with contributing to the neglect of a child once a school attendance officer, or truancy officer, has made “all attempts to secure enrollment and/or attendance of a compulsory-school-age child and is unable to effect the enrollment and/or attendance.”
When a parent or guardian sees an administrator at their home about their child’s attendance, “they know we care about them and don’t just exist as a robocall,” Banks said. Some parents weren’t aware their child had missed so many days, he said.
In total, the Magee High group knocked on 17 doors. By the next week, 13 students had returned to class, though a handful reverted later to absenteeism. Banks said he regularly speaks to the truancy officer assigned to the local high school and middle school. The other one in the school district is based out of Mendenhall, where the bulk of the other schools are clustered.
The trio has taken three visits, speaking to at least five families on each one. They try to find solutions with parents and students, putting them in touch with the school counselor. Banks also put together an assembly called Commit to Graduation where students sign pledges to graduate on time.
Banks said students often express appreciation for the visits, saying, “I didn’t know you cared about me that much.”
‘There are a lot of us’
Teachers follow what educators call a pacing guide, which maps out the order in which instructors teach subject-specific skills and provides an outline for the curriculum.
Each day or week is dedicated to mastering a core competency or skill as it relates to literacy, math, science or social studies. When students stop showing up, especially those in need of additional support, the consequences can be hard to mitigate later on.
Christi Dampeer, a third grade teacher in Mendenhall, has noticed that nearly every student in her multi-tiered support system, or MTSS, group is chronically absent. MTSS is a program that helps academically struggling students stay on track to get promoted to the next grade level. Dampeer finds time to help chronically absent students catch up, but that can be difficult if students miss more than a handful of consecutive classes.
She has noticed that many parents allow their third graders to miss class, thinking the lower elementary math courses are far removed from important benchmarks. Damper said she often hears parents say those grade levels aren’t covering meaningful topics yet.
Some parents and community members also say engaging students in coursework will require active participation from families as well as school staff.

Thompson said his children were sick four times during the 2024-25 school  year, mostly with strep throat. He fears that policies pressuring sick students to attend class have contributed to their more frequent illnesses. He sometimes feels that an at home learning environment is more secure for his children, and has considered homeschooling.
Thompson subscribes to ABC Mouse, an educational video game, for the days that his second-grader and fourth-grader are unable to attend school.
Crystal Blair, who has two children enrolled in Mendenhall schools, said she has been more involved in their schoolwork because she also recently enrolled as a student. She is finishing an undergraduate degree. Unlike some parent friends of hers, Blair has been able to do algebra homework with her daughter. 
“I would like to see more parents help out,” Blair said. “But a lot don’t have the same help at home. Some don’t have W-Ffi.”
Dampeer also noticed that students’ needs aren’t always being met outside of the classroom, which affects their academic performance. She teaches students who regularly miss class for doctors’ appointments and out-of-school counseling. Some parents, Dampeer said, do not push their children to show up to class.
School Counselor Baritt Blount stocks a closet full of clean clothes and teaches students about proper hygiene. She regularly meets students from homes without running water and where parental supervision is slim. The school also has showers and hygiene kits available to those students, she said. 
Blount also tracks those students’ absences. Sometimes, she also visits students at home to talk to a parent or guardian.
“Ever since the pandemic, we’ve been fighting the battle on the flip side,” she said. “Kids are still struggling to get back into familiar routines.”
For one part-time cafeteria employee and grandmother, chronic absenteeism was difficult to avoid because of absent parents. She asked to not share her name out of fear of retaliation at work and from relatives.
The grandmother didn’t expect to be helping raise three grandchildren after rearing four of her own. She ensures they attend school regularly, which wasn’t a priority when their mother was raising them alone.
“You go to Walmart, there are a lot of us,” she said of her new guardian role. “Babies are having babies. Parents aren’t mature enough to take care of their own kids.”
Before her grandchildren and their 26-year-old mother moved in with her, she estimates that the children missed most of the school days the week prior. The grandmother said she was never able to get an adequate answer from her daughter about why they did not attend.
The high school job
Pamela Hobbs teaches mostly seniors in a college and career readiness class at Mendenhall High School. She said she believes the absenteeism resulted from unclear expectations for graduating seniors who had completed most diploma requirements. She has also seen a lot of her students “thrust into adult roles.”
“You still have to do your resume, anything can happen, and you never know,” Hobbs tells her students, even those who have secured local jobs before graduating.

To help prepare for a postsecondary world, Hobbs’ students complete in-class resume writing workshops and other workforce development instruction.
“Those students who are chronically absent are making their own choices, and not like when I was a senior,” she said. “Young people want to be held accountable and want to be responsible.”
Few jobs are open to high schoolers in Pinola. Kiana Russell, a manager at the local Dollar General, began to interview more high schoolers in 2023, after the store changed its policy to allow 16- year-olds to work there.
“You can tell the ones who really need it,” Russell said of part-time work. “It’s a good job for them because they get to see their friends in town and help out around the store.”
School staff have talked with local employers to ensure teenage workers aren’t working late on weeknights. 
Absenteeism for Mississippi high school seniors rose 9% over the past two years. Many seniors who have fulfilled their graduation requirements leave school during the third period for jobs. Some also participate in a late entry program, whereby students who work late hours can have no first period classes. 
Many students’ unexcused absences occur around holidays, on rainy days or when they’re exempt from exams.
Those practices shocked Sen. Hob Bryan, a Democrat from Amory, who conveyed his disappointment to education officials at an October state Senate committee meeting. 
Officials seem to be “signaling to students it’s not really important to come to school,” he said. “We’re shifting from the concept of, there’s an infinite number of things to learn … to something that is so focused on the requirements and testing.”
‘We can’t teach empty seats’
By 3 p.m. on school days, Mendenhall’s teen workforce trades their book bags for aprons. They bag groceries, scan items at the cash register and prepare food at a drive-through. Grocers, fast food joints and hardware stores employ them. Many chronically absent students fall into this category of holding part-time jobs, according to districtwide data. Their jobs often become a priority over their classes.
Mendenhall, the Simpson County seat and second largest city, is about 40 miles southeast from Jackson. Its downtown is dwarfed by a towering courthouse with a dark green dome. Popular area businesses include the Broadhead Do It Center hardware store, Vowell’s Marketplace grocery store and Ward’s, a fast food restaurant. The city’s population is 2,199 people, 28.9% of whom live in poverty.

For many Simpson County residents, a high school job is more than a rite of passage. As one grocery store manager put it, it’s how many high schoolers save enough money for college. 
Blount, the Magee Middle School counselor, still recalls the summer she clerked at her mother’s medical clinic, the afternoons and evenings helping out at a local eye doctor, and when she made sandwiches at a Subway. Afterschool jobs were a key part of her high school years along with algebra and extracurriculars.
Growing up in Magee, Blount said, her parents regularly told her that “school comes first.” Now she echoes that idea for some of her students and their parents. She said she sees her role as a counselor as “bringing the community together” and convincing parents and students of the value of an education. She doesn’t want a job or caretaker role to derail a student’s future.
“We can ensure every kid can come to school, be focused, be ready, be confident in their needs,” Blount said.
Sanders, the Simpson County superintendent, said it’s a priority to incorporate the feedback of high school educators and experts into attendance plans. He offers incentives such as  popsicle parties and other events for students with perfect and nearly perfect attendance records. He has encouraged teachers and principals to pioneer new classroom activities that make use of technology or software like Kahoot, an online learning game. 
“We are trying to create an environment where students want to come,” Sanders said. “We can’t teach empty seats. If there are barriers, share that with us.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/31110819/Truancy10_Submitted-Photo.jpg,,,2026-01-09 12:57:21.783382

Bush, ordered Thursday that the university […]","Ramsi Woodcock has been reassigned from teaching and banned from entering the University of Kentucky College of Law, where he is an assistant professor.A federal judge denied a request from a University of Kentucky law professor to allow him to return to the classroom and end an investigation into his criticism of Israel and support of Palestine. 
U.S. District Judge Danny Reeves, who was appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush, ordered Thursday that the university may continue its investigation into alleged conduct by Professor Ramsi Woodcock. The judge requested to be apprised of the results to make future rulings in the case. 
Reeves’ 41-page order showed that he remained largely unconvinced by Woodcock’s attorneys’ allegations of bias in the university’s actions. 
“While Woodcock may fear a nefarious intent behind the University’s investigation, he has not cleared the bar of demonstrating that the investigation was taken to harass or in bad faith,” Reeves wrote. “Instead, the University’s investigation was triggered by external complaints.” 
Woodcock filed the lawsuit in November seeking to be returned to his duties as a full-time tenured professor. His suit also seeks to block UK from using the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) definition of antisemitism in disciplinary proceedings.
“This case is about university officials torching the First Amendment and the university’s own regulations in an effort to protect a colonization project that practices apartheid and commits genocide,” Woodcock said in a statement to the Lantern Friday. 
“There is strong precedent stretching back to the Civil War that federal courts must intervene when rogue state actors, like the university officials in my case, abuse their authority to try to silence speech that they happen to dislike. I am confident that, with the aid of advice from an appellate panel, the court will act to reinstate me to teaching, and that could potentially happen during the coming semester.”
Jay Blanton, a spokesperson for the university, told the Lantern in a statement that UK “appreciates the Court’s thoughtful and clear ruling in this matter.” 
“The review of Professor Woodcock’s conduct is ongoing, and we will provide updates as the court has asked for in its ruling,” Blanton added. 
Woodcock and UK officials testified in federal court last month. During the hours-long proceeding, Woodcock disputed allegations against him, saying the university misrepresented actions that were part of an academic’s life, such as engaging in scholarly debate. He said his comments on Palestine and Israel were rooted in months-long academic research.
In letters to Woodcock, UK cited four professors who had heard him speak at academic conferences or read his comments on Listservs. They told UK that Woodcock spoke about genocide in Gaza at an academic conference and during another university’s panel discussion and had “spammed” Listservs with personal viewpoints on Palestine and Israel. UK later said four students “some of whom are Jewish” had said Woodcock spoke about the topic in an optional lecture and had shouted “Free Palestine” while in a car with UK law students.
Woodcock’s complaint said he does not talk about his conclusions regarding Palestine and Israel “in his classes because he did not want to cause students to face persecution for speaking about Palestine.”
Woodcock’s attorneys have raised concerns about the ability of Farnaz Farkish Thompson, a partner of McGuire Woods based in Richmond, Virginia, hired by the university, to be an unbiased investigator in the matter. In a letter to her, they said she was listed as a contributor to Project 2025, which was created as a guiding document for the Trump administration leading up to the 2024 presidential election. The document calls for U.S. support of Israel.
Among his various conclusions, Reeves wrote: “It should come as no surprise that the University would seek out an investigator with background knowledge on Israel and Palestine relations due to the nature of the speech at issue. That hiring choice does not breach the threshold for bad faith or harassment.” 
Reeves also said Woodcock’s attorneys failed to show that UK President Eli Capilouto would be “a biased adjudicator” in determining disciplinary proceedings into the professor’s conduct. Capilouto shared a public message in July that did not name Woodcock directly, but indicated the university was aware of his online petition calling for military action against Israel and called his views “if accurately attributed … repugnant.”
Woodcock received notice of the university’s investigation days later. 
Reeves said that UK “must be allowed to distance itself from any ideology or speech that threatens its efficient operations or undermines its mission or ethos.” 
Woodcock has continued to remain “a tenured faculty member with full pay and benefits from the University” while he has not been allowed to teach or enter the College of Law building, Reeves wrote. The judge said that “does not generally threaten irreparable harm.” Woodcock had testified that by not having access to the law building, he could not continue attending faculty meetings or use the law library for research. 
Woodcock may amend his complaint after “the investigation is completed or any subsequent disciplinary procedures have concluded and claims have been exhausted,” Reeves said. 
Both sides are to give status reports every 30 days to Reeves about the status of the investigation and other future proceedings.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Untitled-design-22-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-09 12:12:36.638771

Eric Chung announced Tuesday that his campaign for the Democratic nomination for Michigan’s 10th Congressional District has raised over $1,125,000 million, including more than $255,000 raised in the 4th Quarter of 2025.
Former Navy SEAL Matt Maasdam’s campaign to win the Democratic nomination for Michigan’s 7th District announced Tuesday that it raised more than $1 million in 2025, including $400,000 in 2025’s 4th Quarter. Maasdam also announced the endorsement of grassroots organizer Susan Anderson, a founder of the Blue Brigade.

The sites, which were awarded to the Oklahoma tribe and the Indiana Economic Development Corporation, are the first two testing grounds for drones and other unmanned aircraft created in nearly a decade, according to the FAA.
In a statement Friday, James Grimsley, the Choctaw Nation’s executive director of Advanced Technology Initiatives, said the “designation is a meaningful step” for both the tribe and the future of aviation in Oklahoma.
The test site program is designed to evaluate the safety, operations and navigation systems of public and civil drone technologies prior to their use in national airspace, he said.
The Choctaw Nation said that the designation “comes at a critical time” as the FAA moves to create new rules that allows drones to be flown beyond line of sight, or where operators can’t see them, which will expand their commercial and public safety uses.
“Drone technology is already changing how services are delivered and how critical infrastructure is inspected, monitored and protected,” Grimsley said. “The next chapter is about proving what works safely at scale, and our role as a test site is to generate the data, operational insights and best practices that help make that possible.” 
In a separate statement, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the new test sites will help gather critical data so “we can safely unleash innovation in our skies.”
The FAA said Duffy unveiled a proposed Beyond Visual Line of Sight rule to expand drone usage in August.
“From delivering lifesaving medicine to surveying pipelines, drones are already reshaping industries and changing how people and products interact,” Duffy said in a statement. “It’s our job to make sure the United States safely leads the way with this exciting technology – not China. We’ve added these new test sites to help us gather critical data and test new systems so we can safely unleash innovation in our skies.”

Plan selections and premium payments weren’t processed for some people who purchased coverage from ConnectiCare on the state exchange, Access Health CT CEO James Michel said.
“Access Health CT is notifying all impacted consumers. People may contact ConnectiCare directly for information regarding billing issues,” Michel stated.
Officials haven’t yet been able to confirm how many people were impacted. Michel estimated that it’s no more than 1,000. 
Ben Jackey, a ConnectiCare spokesperson, did not address a question from the Connecticut Mirror about how many people were impacted, but said the issue stemmed from a “system conversion” on Jan. 1.
“We are working diligently to rectify any related issues temporarily impacting members. ConnectiCare is committed to providing high-quality health plans and service and we encourage members to contact us with any questions,” Jackey stated in emailed comments.
The Connecticut Department of Insurance had only “just begun” hearing of the issues on Wednesday, the agency’s assistant deputy commissioner Gerard O’Sullivan stated in emailed comments.
“We are working with ConnectiCare and Access Health CT to determine the scope of the problem and expect to have more information in the next few days. Any consumer who is experiencing issues is encouraged to contact the Connecticut Insurance Department so we can review and intervene on individual cases,” O’Sullivan said.
While current estimates suggest the impact is relatively contained, reports of the glitches come at a hectic time for ACA plan enrollees. There are just three weeks remaining in Connecticut’s open enrollment period, and some residents are reassessing what coverage they can afford following the Dec. 31 expiration of some federal financial assistance for subsidies.
On Feb. 1, 2025, ConnectiCare was acquired by Molina Healthcare, a Fortune 500 company that has members in 22 states. 
Connecticut residents have been complaining online about processing issues, website issues and customer service delays since the Jan. 1 conversion. Several pointed out that “Connecticut” wasn’t even an option in the state dropdown menu on Molina’s website.
Molina is one of two companies that offers individual medical plans on Connecticut’s health exchange, in addition to Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield. 
In 2025, Molina-owned companies, which included ConnectiCare Insurance Company and ConnectiCare Benefits, covered nearly half of the more than 150,000 residents enrolled in a state exchange plan.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP105258032254-1024x717.jpg,,,2026-01-09 11:59:39.628927

The person stayed  at the Hyatt Place in Hamburg from December 31, 2025 – January 2, 2026, the health department announced on social media. 
“Measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus that can cause serious health complications, especially in young children. Vaccination is the best protection against measles,” the health department said. “If you have concerns about exposure to measles, contact your health care provider.” 
According to the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, there were 13 cases of measles in Kentucky last year. 
Kentucky health officials recently announced another potential exposure from an unvaccinated traveler who visited the Ark Encounter in Williamstown on Dec. 29 and stayed at the Holiday Inn & Suites in Dry Ridge Dec. 28-30.
Measles is extremely contagious and spread through the air from coughs or sneezes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One infected person can infect 9 in 10 unprotected people around them, the CDC says. 
Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash. The CDC recommends the measles vaccination series at 12-15 months and then at 4-6 years old.

Vaccinations have fallen and measles cases nationwide increased, with 2025 bringing the highest number of reported cases since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000. Connecticut reported one case, and the state had the highest MMR, or measles, mumps and rubella, vaccination rates in the nation among kindergarteners for the 2024-2025 school year.
In Connecticut, 98.2% of kindergarteners received their MMR vaccine, according to CDC data. Herd immunity, a form of indirect protection against the spread of communicable disease, is met when 95% or more of a population is vaccinated. Only nine other states reached herd immunity for the MMR vaccine in the 2024-2025 school year.
Overall vaccination rates for Connecticut children have increased since 2020 after they fell during pandemic. According to a Washington Post analysis, the only other states to see this increase were Maine and Alabama.
Connecticut only allows for medical exemptions to vaccinations for school-age children after eliminating religious exemptions in 2021. The state does not allow personal exemptions. But even with these laws, some schools did not meet the 95% threshold for herd immunity.
However, many towns in the state met herd immunity for last year’s kindergarten classes. Some have very high levels of vaccination — over 98%.
While the state has high levels of childhood vaccination, seasonal vaccination rates are not as high. This flu season, according to state data as of Dec. 2, the flu vaccination rate was down 6% compared to the same time last year. There has also been an increase in flu cases and hospitalizations, and cases are far higher this year than they were the same time last year.
This overload of flu cases came just before this week’s announcement from the Trump administration overhauling the childhood vaccination schedule.

The findings are reported by the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing, which handles food-establishment inspections at the state level.
Listed below are some of the more serious findings that stem from inspections at Iowa restaurants, stores, care facilities and other businesses between Nov. 13, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2025. (Last year, DIAL began withholding from public disclosure all food-safety inspection reports for eight days past the date of inspection.)
The inspections department reminds the public that its reports are a “snapshot” in time, and violations are often corrected on the spot before the inspector leaves the establishment. For a more complete list of all inspections, along with additional details on each of the inspections listed below, visit the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing’s website.
Big R’s Bar & Grill, 103 Main St., Elberon — During a Dec. 31 visit, a state inspector cited this Tama County establishment for 11 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number. Violations included failure to ensure that all food came from approved sources as evidenced by “venison peppersticks” that were labeled “not for sale” and were stored in a chest freezer alongside other food items. The restaurant was also cited for home-canned vegetables that were stored on kitchen shelves alongside food used to serve patrons.
“Cooking pots and pans on the stove were not clean and have not been used since yesterday,” the inspector noted. “Onion slicer and potato dicer have dried food debris and buildup (although) the person in charge states they have not been used for several days.”
In addition, the flat-top grill and the flame grill each had a “large buildup” of an unspecified nature, and the kitchen sink designated for handwashing was blocked with several dirty dishes and was not accessible for handwashing. Also, household pest-control chemicals were stored in areas where food and clean equipment were being stored, an open package of rodent bait was found in the kitchen, and the food-preparation table and breading station were soiled.
“Floors are not kept clean in the kitchen and dry storage rooms,” the inspector reported. “Living quarters within the facility were open to the restaurant during the inspection.”
State records show the restaurant last underwent a routine inspection in April 2021.
Wilbo Burgers Brats & Beers, 118 Main St., Cedar Falls — During a Dec. 29 visit, a Black Hawk County inspector cited this restaurant for employees failing to wash their hands, storing food-to-go containers on the floor of the basement under a set of water pipes, for an unspecified “buildup” of some kind within the ice machine, and for green peppers and house-made barbecue sauce that had been held longer than the maximum of seven days. Also, there was no detectable level of sanitizing solution used at the wait station, and the hot water supplied to the handwashing sink had been shut off due to a slow leak.
Eddie’s Tavern, 407 D St., Sergeant Bluff — During a Dec. 23 visit, a Siouxland District Health Department inspector found bags of shredded lettuce and tomatoes that had a discard date of Dec. 13, 2025. Also, the interior of the ice machine was visibly soiled with “debris buildup” and the kitchen wall behind and alongside the griddle was melting, with the wall covering “breaking off.”
Nara Thai, 1725 Blairs Ferry Road, Marion — During a Dec. 23 visit, a Linn County inspector noted that salmon and shrimp were stored in the same tray as cucumbers and mixed peppers inside the refrigerator – a repeat violation. Also, five bars of cream cheese were sitting out at room temperature and were measured at 66 degrees before the staff agreed to discard them. In addition, there was a container of Thai soup that was not date-marked as to when it was either prepared or needed to be discarded – a repeat violation. In addition, the handwashing station in the kitchen was not supplied with soap, and employees’ personal food was stored in the refrigerator and freezer alongside food to be served to patrons.
Fareway, 115 1st Ave., Sioux Center — During a Dec. 22 visit, a Siouxland District Health Department inspector noted that the meat department staff was not following proper handwashing protocols while packaging food for customers. Also, deviled eggs and cut pineapple were still in the display case and being offered for sale after their discard date.
The Other Place, 2010 SE Delaware, Ankeny — During a Dec. 22 visit, a state inspector found taco meat that had been holding in the walk-in cooler for two hours and had yet to drop below 85 degrees. The taco meat was then discarded. The inspector also noted that preparation and discard times on pizza slices were not being documented or monitored. The pizza slices were discarded.
In addition, there was no soap at the handwashing sink, and the inspector discussed with management the fact that cooked taco meat, chicken wings and grinder meat were all being cooled in large plastic tubs, which inhibited their ability to cool rapidly once placed in the cooler.
Subway, 1864 Highway 141, Sloan — During a Dec. 22 visit, a Siouxland District Health Department inspector noted that the food protection manager’s certification had expired in July 2025 and that “lunch meats such as turkey and chicken,” were holding at 47 degrees, too warm to ensure their safety, and had to be discarded. The cooler was taken out of service and plans were made to have it repaired so it would keep food at 41 degrees or colder. The restaurant was last inspected in June 2022, according to state records.
Good Eatin’s, 5418 Douglas Ave., Des Moines — During a Dec. 18 visit, a state inspector noted that the person in charge was unable to demonstrate proper sanitizing procedures and was not a certified food protection manager. Also, the staff was not ensuring “the proper temperatures of food received,” the inspector reported.
“Cheese observed … damaged or discolored inside clear sealed packaging,” the inspector reported, adding that the cheese in question had to be discarded, and that “soft cheese” was being stored in what the inspector called a “non-operational walk-in room.”
La Finca, 916 W. 2nd St., Davenport — During a Dec. 18 visit, a Scott County inspector noted that three pots of cooked beef were holding at 107 degrees and were being cooled down at room temperature, outside of a refrigerator.  The beef was then placed in pans and moved to a freezer. The inspector’s report also made note of an unspecified issue involving “bison,” adding that unspecified food items inside one of the coolers were being held at 51 to 54 degrees and had to be discarded.
The inspector also reported, without explaining, that cut limes and salsa were “over stocked” and were holding at 51 degrees and had to be moved to another cooler. “Several food items in coolers not date-marked,” the inspector reported. “Tamales and other food items not covered in walk-in freezer and the chest freezer… Walk-in freezer floor has excess food debris on it.”










Mouse-like droppings were observed along the interior cabinets of the fryers ... Boxes containing cans of olives and pudding were observed being stored on the floor in the kitchen.


– Inspector's report on Rudy's Tacos in Bettendorf


Rudy’s Tacos, 3111 Devil’s Glen Road, Bettendorf – During a Dec. 18 visit, a Scott County inspector reported that a container of cooked ground beef was holding on the lunch buffet line at 120 to 122 degrees, which was not hot enough to ensure safety. Because the beef had been on the buffet line for less than two hours at that point, it was reheated to 165 degrees and then returned to the buffet line.  Also, one pan of cooked ground beef was observed sitting out, unattended, on a food-preparation table and was measured at 45 degrees. The beef was returned to a cooler for holding until it was ready to be put to use.
Also, the interior of one cooler had a pool of “dark colored substance and food residue” covering the bottom; the interior drawer of the food-preparation table was marred by a buildup of crumbs, dried food debris, and grease; the interior of the ice machine had a “small accumulation of soil;” and a can of Hot Shot Flying Insect Killer, not approved for use in a commercial kitchen, was stored in the kitchen.
“Mouse-like droppings were observed along the interior cabinets of the fryers,” the inspector reported. “Boxes containing cans of olives and pudding were observed being stored on the floor in the kitchen.”
Fuse, 224 2nd Ave. NE, Dyersville — During a Dec. 17 visit, a state inspector noted that a cold-holding unit used to keep food chilled was unplugged and was storing food at 60 degrees — well above the 41-degree maximum. All of the food stored in the unit was then discarded. In addition, the house-made barbecue sauce, pasta sauce, and soup were not marked with dates to ensure freshness and safety; the house-made Caesar dressing was made with unpasteurized eggs and had to be discarded; the dishwashing machine used to sanitize dishes was reaching a temperature of only 132 degrees, and the interior of the ice machine “appeared unclean,” the inspector reported.
Izumi Japanese Steak House, 4901 Utica Ridge Road, Davenport — During a Dec. 17 visit, a Scott County inspector found that lemon juice that required refrigeration was being stored at room temperature and a bottle of liquor “had fruit flies floating in the bottle.”
Also, cooked rice stored in large containers inside the walk-in cooler was measured at 53 to 57 degrees and had to be discarded; the ice machine and fountain-drink machine each contained “debris and gunk,” and access to a kitchen handwashing sink was blocked by equipment. The walk-in cooler door, door seal, and cooler fans contained “debris and gunk,” and the hot-water handle on the kitchen handwashing sink was broken off.
Maid Rite Diner, 3708 N. Division St., Davenport — During a Dec. 17 visit, a state inspector found that a food-preparation cooler was holding items at 51 to 52 degrees, which was too warm to ensure safety. “This is a repeat violation and requires long-term corrective action,” the inspector noted. Also, there was chili that was not date-marked to ensure freshness and safety, and several items that were pulled from the freezer did not have the proper date markings.
In addition, “several items throughout the facility” had been held past the maximum of seven days, such as tomatoes dated Dec. 9, house-made ranch dressing dated Dec. 10, and queso dated Nov. 22.  Also, a box of dinner napkins was “stored on the ground in the back storage room near the restrooms” and the fryers had an excess buildup of grease inside them and on their tops.
Tony Roma’s, 350 Bell St., Dubuque — During a Dec. 17 visit, a city inspector made note of cheese that was not date-marked to ensure freshness and safety, tomato pasta that had a “use by” date of Dec. 14, cooked pork butt that had a “use by” date of Dec. 16, chipotle garlic butter that had a “use by” date of Dec. 16, and maple butter that had a “use by” date of Dec. 5. All of the outdated food items were then discarded.
In addition, racks inside one of the coolers were unclean and rusty, and the microwave ovens were visibly soiled. The visit was part of a preopening inspection triggered by a change in ownership.
“License not approved,” the inspector reported. As of Jan. 8, 2026, the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing had yet to post any information indicating a follow-up inspection had been performed.
Mojitos Bar and Grill, 3303 S. Center St., Marshalltown — During a Dec. 16 visit, a state inspector found that gelatin desserts had been prepared in a private home and had to be removed from the food service. Also, two pans of carnitas did not have date-markings to ensure freshness and safety, and several items had been held past the maximum of seven days, including beans dated Dec. 8, chicken dated Dec. 4, ground beef dated Dec. 6, and salsa dated Nov. 30. Also, cut tomato, cooked shrimp, and octopus had no date markings.
Mandarin Café, 1117 2nd St., Perry — During a Dec. 15 visit, a state inspector noted there was no certified food protection manager on staff, and the restaurant had eggs that did not come from an approved source and had to be removed from the kitchen. Also, chicken was being stored on a food-preparation table without any temperature control, and several foods previously cooked and cooled had no dates of preparation on them. “Some foods discarded during inspection,” the inspector reported, adding that carrots and cabbage inside a mesh bag were being stored “on the ground” and several food items were stored without lids or other coverings to prevent contamination.
Haley’s Deli Barbecue and Catering, 501 N. 3rd Ave., Marshalltown — During a Dec. 15 visit, a state inspector cited this establishment for 13-risk factor violations, an exceptionally high number.
Among the issues: The person in charge was not a certified food protection manager, and several food items — including chicken and noodles, mashed potatoes, meatloaf, gravy, corn, green beans, smoked chicken pieces, rice, and various cooked meats — were not held at safe temperatures and had to be discarded. Also, the restaurant had no consistent date-marking system in place to ensure food items were fresh and safe to eat.
Included among the foods that were date-marked, but past their expiration, were baked beans dated Dec. 7, pasta salad dated Dec. 6, macaroni salad dated Dec. 5, and broccoli salad dated Nov. 27, all of which had to be discarded.
In addition, equipment and utensils that were washed in the kitchen’s three compartment sink and mechanical dishwasher were not being sanitized, and although the business had a full-service alcohol bar, it lacked the means to clean and sanitize bar ware.
The inspector also reported that the door of the cold deli case had a “buildup of mold-like residue” and said the gas-fed, open-flame rotisserie and flat-top grill that were being used lacked “any type of ventilation.”
The visit was in response to a non-illness complaint pertaining to adulterated food and food from unsafe sources. “Complaint is closed and unverifiable,” the inspector reported. According to state records, the last time the restaurant was inspected was in October 2022.
Crawford Brew Works, 3659 Devil’s Glen Road, Bettendorf – During a Dec. 12 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this establishment for 11 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number. The inspector found the restaurant did not have a certified food protection manager on staff to oversee daily operations in the kitchen. Also, a worker was seen handling raw ground beef and then, with the same gloves on, handling a hamburger bun.
In addition, two containers of whipped cream were being held at 49 degrees and had to be discarded; a pan of cooked shrimp prepared several days prior had no date markings; the interior lids, shelves, and walls of all three food-preparation coolers had a “buildup of food debris and soil” on them; there was no thin-tipped probe thermometer in the kitchen for checking the temperature of prepared food products; and a plastic serving cup sitting in a container of cooked corn within a hot-holding unit “appeared to be slowly melting” inside the container of corn.
Minh’s Gourmet, 2215 Ridgeview Drive, Davenport — During a Dec. 12 visit, a Scott County inspector reported seeing the owner touching, with his bare hands, the sweet and sour chicken that was ready to be served to a customer. The inspector intervened and the dish was discarded. Also, rice that was cooked had not cooled below 67 degrees within two hours and had to be discarded.
The restaurant was also storing sprouts at room temperature — a repeat violation the inspector said required long-term corrective action. In addition, the tempura chicken in the walk-in cooler had inaccurate date-markings on it. The owner indicated chicken was made twice weekly, on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and he was given the opportunity to place new date-markings on the chicken.
“Interior of the ice machine has a buildup of grime,” the inspector reported. “Interior of the walk-in cooler – the fans, walls, ceiling and racks — have an excess buildup of dust and debris.”










There is a buildup of food spills and crumbs under and around equipment in the deli area ... The floors in the deli are not clean… License is expired.


– Inspector's report on Bobby's Grocery and Barbecue in Dysart 


Bobby’s Grocery and BBQ, 305 Crisman St., Dysart — During a Dec. 11 visit, a state inspector cited this grocery store and full-service deli for operating without a license and for holding numerous foods at unsafe temperatures — including smoked sausage pasta, fried chicken, potato salad and Oreo fluff. The pasta and chicken were discarded, while the salads were moved to a colder location in the same cooler.
The inspector also reported the business did not have a date-marking system in pace to ensure food was fresh and safe to eat, and some foods had incorrect preparation and discard dates on them. Also, hard boiled eggs, pulled pork, cooked vegetables, cooled nacho cheese sauce, and fried chicken had no preparation or discard dates on them.
The inspector also found that food items that had been prepared and packaged within the store — including smoked sausage pasta, pasta salad, smoked pork roast, and fried chicken — were not labeled with ingredients or allergens.
“There is a buildup of food spills and crumbs under and around equipment in the deli area,” the inspector reported. “The floors in the deli are not clean… License is expired.”
The inspector did not approve the application for a new license, noting that a penalty fee for operating without a license would first have to be paid, and indicated a revisit would be scheduled to confirm corrective action was taken to address some of the violations that were found.
On Dec. 18, another inspection took place and the business was again cited for storing food in a retail sales case at temperatures that were unsafe. Barbecue meats, fried chicken, potato salad, coleslaw, shredded cheese and dessert salad were found to be out of temperature and were discarded. The facility’s license application was then approved.
Supermarket Villachuato, 107 N. Center St., Marshalltown — During a Dec. 9 visit, a state inspector found the person in charge was not a certified food protection manager. The business was cited for using cardboard shipping boxes as a cutting surface for vegetables; for maintaining cooked, shredded meat in a self-service hot case at temperatures of only 119 to 124 degrees; for failing to date-mark house-made salsas and packaged, cooked chickens; for offering a roasted chicken that had an expiration date of Nov. 19; and for selling house-made sauces, pasta, beans and tortillas that were packaged are not labeled with ingredients or allergens.
The visit was in response to a complaint pertaining to food from unsafe sources and cross-contamination of food items. The complaint was deemed verified.
Hotel Blackhawk, 200 E. 3rd St., Davenport — During a Dec. 3 visit, a Scott County inspector cited the hotel’s restaurant for failing to have employed a certified food protection manager with management and supervisory responsibility. In addition, the business was cited for several food items kept outside safe temperature ranges, including cooked chicken at 51 degrees, and shrimp and ground beef at 45 to 50 degrees. Other food items had expired, including cooked chorizo that was date-marked Nov. 19, and house-made sauce dated Nov. 20. The inspector also reported finding diced pineapple and mangos that were date-marked Nov. 24.
Also, excess food debris was noted in a microwave oven, a cooler, a holster for the pop-dispensing gun, and a mixer. The hood vents were “dripping grease” and the floor in the dry storage area had excess dirt and debris, the inspector reported.
Casa Tequila Mexican Restaurant, 4908 N. Pine St., Davenport — During a Nov. 25 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this establishment for 13 risk-factor violations, an exceptionally high number. Among the issues: The walk-in cooler was holding all food at a temperature of 43 to 44 degrees, rather than 41 degrees or colder; two pans of queso were left sitting out at room temperature and were measured at 52 degrees; rice prepared the previous day was not reheated to 165 degrees prior to being put on a steam table; ground beef in the walk-in cooler had not cooled to 41 degrees within six hours and had to be discarded, and rice and queso on the steam table were measured at 107 to 108 degrees and had to be reheated to 165 degrees.
Also, a basin holding raw meat was stored on the floor of the kitchen, frozen meat was being thawed by being left to sit out at room temperature, and non-food-grade plastic grocery bags with ink on them were being used to hold tortillas and to thaw meat.
Fresh Fit Meals, 11881 Hickman Road, Urbandale — During a Nov. 21 visit, a state inspector reported that packaged meals in the retail walk-in cooler were being stored above the maximum of 41 degrees, including the bison hamburger bowl at 46 to 50 degrees, and the Philly bowl at 45 degrees.
Also, the inspector reported, “dates are not transferring from prepared ingredients to prepared meals” — suggesting that the prepared meals had expiration dates that were beyond the expiration dates of some of the individual ingredients. The inspector reported discussing with management the practice of “using the oldest date of ingredients” when determining the expiration date of prepared meals.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-09 15:31:54+00:00,CT Mirror,ICE makes arrests in New Haven as pro-immigrant groups mourn Renee Good,Michayla Savitt | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/09/ice-arrests-new-haven-renee-good/,New Haven police said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested three people in the city Thursday.,"New Haven police say that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested three people in the city Thursday. The news was among a flurry of local and national immigration developments on the minds of immigrant advocates who gathered at a downtown rally later in the day.
The latest arrests show that the advocacy work is far from over, said Kica Matos with the National Immigration Law Center, who was among the rally speakers.
“They were here today in this block snatching people away in broad daylight, and it is happening everywhere,” Matos said.
Few details about the arrests were available Thursday night. ICE officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but the New Haven Police Department confirmed ICE made three arrests Thursday in downtown.
A department spokesman said ICE officials did notify New Haven police of the action, but local officers were not involved in the arrests.
People at the rally also mourned the death of a Minneapolis woman who was shot and killed Wednesday by an ICE agent.
Fumika Mizuno, a volunteer with the New Haven Immigrants Coalition, led the New Haven crowd in a moment of silence to honor the life of Renee Nicole Good, a mother of three. Mizuno also included all those who have died or disappeared while in ICE custody.
After the crowd held the silence for nearly a minute, Mizuno invited people to lay flowers on the steps of the New Haven Superior Court, where a handwritten sign read: “We will not be complicit.”
“We hold rage and grief and yet we choose to be here together because we transform those into action, and through action we build hope,” Mizuno said.
“If there was ever a time for us to come together, that time is right now,” said Rev. Scott Marks, director of New Haven Rising. “And all the things that would cause us to be separate and apart, I call for solidarity.”
Other vigils were held across Connecticut, including one at an ICE field office in Hartford.
The rallies across the state came soon after Avelo Airlines announced the end of its involvement with federal deportation flights out of Arizona. The news came after months of protests at Tweed New Haven Airport, where Avelo has a significant presence, and a widespread boycott of the airline over the practice.
An Avelo spokesperson said Wednesday that the airline’s decision to end its partnership with ICE was purely financial.
Advocates said Avelo ending its contract does not mean that the group’s advocacy is done. They will keep pushing back against the Trump administration’s heightened immigration enforcement.
“We aren’t going to stop resisting until every loved one, every neighbor, and every family member is home, and we aren’t going to stop until this death machine is abolished. We will keep showing up,” Mizuno said, as the crowd cheered in response.

GLENDALE, Ariz. – Trinidad Chambliss’s last-gasp pass into the end zone, intended for De’Zhaun Stribling, had fallen incomplete. Despite several tugs of Stribling’s jersey and significant contact from a Miami defender, pass interference was not called. The State Farm Stadium scoreboard at the Fiesta Bowl showed Miami with 31 points, Ole Miss with 27. The clock showed all zeroes.
This crazy, often magical 2025 Ole Miss football season finally ended Thursday, eight days into 2026 and one victory short of playing in the national championship game. Many of the Rebel players stared at the scoreboard almost as if in disbelief. Several shed tears while embracing one another. Across the field, Miami players celebrated wildly. Some of them were crying tears of joy. This game dripped drama.

A few minutes later, quarterback Trinidad Chambliss and running back Kewan Lacy trudged off the field together, Chambliss with a towel over his head, Lacy with his arm draped over Chambliss’s shoulder.
There, to greet them in the tunnel leading to the Ole Miss locker room, was former Miami superstar and Pro Football Hall of Fame linebacker Ray Lewis. Lewis had witnessed the effort the Rebels duo had put forth. Chambliss threw for 277 yards and a touchdown. Lacy, after missing time with a tweaked hamstring and then playing despite it, ran for 103 yards and another touchdown.
Lewis is one of the greatest competitors in football history and knows valor and grit when he sees it. That’s why he was outside Ole Miss’s locker room and not inside Miami’s. He wanted to console the two Rebel offensive stars who had displayed remarkable effort and grit galore. Onlookers couldn’t hear what Lewis said, but we could see he meant it.

Moments later, Lacy, Chambliss and the rest of the Rebels made their way into the locker room where Pete Golding, their head coach, greeted each and every one of them, some with handshakes, some with bear hugs. Golding appeared totally drained, bleary-eyed, exhausted. His Rebels had fought so valiantly, especially after being dominated early in the game when Miami kept the ball for 20 of the game’s first 23 minutes and held Ole Miss to a negative one yard of total offense in the first quarter.
And so Miami will go on to play for the national championship just a few miles from its campus. Ole Miss will begin to build for next year. Lacy will be back for the Rebels. Chambliss hopes to be. Many more of the Rebels who made this the longest and most memorable season in Ole Miss history will be back for another run, having shown, even in Thursday night’s defeat, they belonged on the national stage.
“I can’t tell you how proud I am of this group,” Golding would say in the post-game press conference. “They never flinched, they never panicked … This group created a legacy and an expectation for this program. We didn’t play our best and we didn’t coach our best, but I couldn’t ask any more in terms of effort. … Effort has never been an issue with these guys.”

Anyone who watched the game, no matter your allegiance, knows that, at least on this night, the better team won. Indeed, the bigger, stronger team won, often dominating the line of scrimmage. The Hurricanes possessed the ball for more than 41 of the game’s 60 minutes. Miami ran a whopping 88 plays, compared to just 60 plays for the Rebels.
Miami won the game on third and fourth downs. Ole Miss converted just two of 10 third down plays. Miami converted 11 of 19 third downs and two of two fourth down gambles. The Ole Miss defense just could not get off the field.
Still, Ole Miss, displaying the same doggedness that won the Sugar Bowl over Georgia seven days earlier, stayed in the game. Even when Miami scored the go-ahead touchdown on Carson Beck’s three-yard scramble with 18 seconds remaining, Ole Miss fired back.
Chambliss hit Cayden Lee with a 23-yard strike to near midfield. Thirteen seconds remained. After an incompletion, Chambliss completed a 17-yard laser to Stribling. That left time for one heave to the end zone. Could Chambliss, the miracle worker, do it again? At this point, would anyone have been surprised? Stribling was the target in the left corner of the end zone with heavy coverage from two Miami defenders. There tugs of Stribling’s jersey. There was contact. There was no flag.
Could have been called. Wasn’t.
“That play did not lose us the game,” Golding would say. 
The truth is: Miami, a talented, red-hot team playing its best football when it mattered most, won the game more than Ole Miss lost it. 
Beck, a 23-year-old millionaire, played almost flawlessly, throwing for 268 yards and two touchdowns and running in the game-winner. Bruising running back Mark Fletcher slammed into the line over and over, 22 times for 133 yards, often pushing the pile. Wide receiver Malachi Toney, a marvelously talented, just turned 18-year-old freshman, caught five balls for 81 yards and turned an at-first-harmless-looking quick screen into a highlight reel, 36-yard touchdown dash. Malachi Toney, remember that name. You will be hearing it for years.
Yes, and 6-foot-9 inch, 345-pound Miami left tackle Markell Bell of Cleveland, Mississippi, and Holmes Community College anchored a massive, often dominant Miami offensive line. Miami has now played 15 games. Bell has yet to give up a sack.

So, Ole Miss didn’t lose, so much as Miami won. The Rebels were heroic even in defeat. The team that lost its head coach just as preparations for the playoffs began never surrendered.
Said Golding, when asked about his team’s legacy, “I’ll just remember how they embraced one another. There’s been a lot happen over the last month to where somebody could have not been a good dude. Somebody could have not worked hard. Somebody could have not showed up on time. I can’t recall a single issue. That’s who they are. They just went to work and made sure everyone around them went to work.”
Golding continued, “But to me, I’ll remember the smiles, man. It’s the memories. It’s the laughs. It’s the camaraderie and how they grew together. They’re going to be talking about this for a long, long time right? Some of it will be about what could have happened and all that, but they’ve made memories in that locker room that will last a lifetime.”
Yes, they have. And those of us lucky enough to have witnessed it won’t forget it any time soon.

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)The two groups that sought to enshrine nonpartisan court races are now united behind a single ballot initiative, CI-132, put forward by Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts.
The ballot initiative was one of two nearly identical constitutional initiatives launched to counter a push by Republican leadership, including Gov. Greg Gianforte, throughout the 2025 Legislature to make changes to the state’s judicial system, including allowing judges to run with partisan affiliation.
According to a Thursday press release, Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges, the group started by Ted Dick and Pepper Peterson that sponsored CI-131, announced their endorsement of CI-132.
The consolidation “signals a united effort to protect Montana voters’ 90-year right to nonpartisan judicial elections,” Dick said in a press release. “Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges believes Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts has a strong policy and the resources to ensure the initiative qualifies for the ballot, which is why we have chosen to formally endorse CI-132.”
Dick has formally requested to withdraw CI-131 with the Montana Secretary of State.
Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts is a coalition comprising multiple advocacy groups throughout the state including Montana Federation of Public Employees, Big Sky 55+, ACLU of Montana, Forward Montana, and Catalyst Montanan.
The group gained endorsements from retired Montana Supreme Court Justices Mike McGrath and Pat Cotter, and lists more than 1,000 individual supporters on its website.
The text of CI-132 proposes to amend Article VII of the state’s Constitution by adding “Section 12. Nonpartisan Judicial Elections. Judicial elections shall remain nonpartisan.”
“We know that Montanans want to protect their right to judicial elections free from the influence of political parties and politicians,” Caitie Butler, spokesperson for Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts, said in a statement. “We are proud to stand with those who have endorsed CI-131 and CI-132 and begin the work of qualifying this critical initiative for the November ballot.”
The process to get the ballot initiative before voters has already hit some bumps, including a brief legal challenge against Attorney General Austin Knudsen, whose office initially approved the ballot measure as legally sufficient, but rewrote the language of the proposed ballot statement, arguing it did not inform voters what “nonpartisan” meant.
Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts appealed to the Montana Supreme Court, which rejected the AG’s language with the majority saying it injected politics into a “straightforward proposition.”
Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts launched signature gathering efforts for CI-132 in December and will spend the next five months talking with voters across the state about the importance of nonpartisan judicial elections.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Old_Supco2-1024x717.jpg,,,2026-01-09 10:11:44.522246

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Republican gubernatorial candidate Scott Schwab reported $1.3 million in campaign contributions as of Dec. 31, while Democrat Ethan Corson attracted $900,000 in donations to fuel his campaign for governor.
Schwab and Corson released information on their 2025 fundraising reports ahead of the Monday deadline for submitting financial documents to the Kansas Public Disclosure Commission and Kansas Secretary of State’s office.
So far, more than a dozen candidates have announced campaigns for the Republican or Democratic party nominations for governor in Kansas. Their capacity to generate significant donations would be viewed as a measure of political viability in terms of the August primaries. In 2022, Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly raised more than $7.7 million for her successful reelection campaign.
Schwab, who has served as Kansas’ secretary of state since 2019, said his campaign for governor attracted more than $1.3 million.
“These results show support for the only conservative in the race with a comprehensive plan for addressing the Kansas property tax crisis,” he said. “Kansans want a leader who will do more than share hollow rhetoric about issues, but put forth solutions that put the taxpayer first.”
Schwab’s most prominent GOP rivals include former Gov. Jeff Colyer, Senate President Ty Masterson and Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt. They haven’t announced fundraising totals yet.

Corson, a Democratic state senator from Johnson County, said he accepted more than 3,000 contributions and that 70% of these donations were for less than $100. He reported securing more than $900,000 since July. His rival in the primary is Sen. Cindy Holscher, also of Johnson County. She has not yet released campaign donation information.
“Our campaign is about creating a Kansas where the next generation can build a life right here, and this milestone is proof that people all across the state believe in that vision,” Corson said.
During the 2025 portion of the campaign cycle, Corson said his campaign traveled 11,000 miles to dozens of cities. He’s been endorsed by more than 10 labor unions as well as Kelly, who referred to him as “most suited” to be the next governor.
In the campaign for attorney general, Democrat Chris Mann officially filed as a candidate and said his campaign raised $536,000 in 2025. Republican Attorney General Kris Kobach said he would run for reelection but hasn’t released a summary of his campaign treasurer’s report. In 2022, Kobach received 50.8% of the vote to narrowly defeat Mann, who claimed 49.2% of ballots cast.
Mann said 89% of his 2,500 contributions came from Kansans, which he said was an indication of momentum of his second campaign for attorney general.
“Kansans want an attorney general who is focused on protecting communities, upholding the law fairly, and delivering real results, not playing politics,” Mann said. “The record level of support we’re seeing makes it clear that people are ready for a new direction in the attorney general’s office.”
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Republican from Wichita, said he generated $427,300 during 2025 for his campaign for state insurance commissioner.
He asserted the total “breaks all previous records for down-ballot races at this point in the election cycle,” comparing it to campaigns for secretary of state, state treasurer and insurance commissioner in 2014, 2018 and 2022. He didn’t acknowledge Mann’s higher total in the campaign for attorney general.
“I’m truly overwhelmed by the support I’ve received from across the state,” said Hawkins, who promised to lower insurance costs and address insurance companies operating unethically or illegally.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/P1132223-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-09 10:11:44.522246

Over time, some cities have met the state’s criteria without being added to the list, while others no longer qualify yet continue to reap the benefits. Oversight of the designations seems to have been lost.","THE TERM “Gateway City” was first coined in a 2007 report published by MassINC (the nonprofit civic organization that also publishes CommonWealth Beacon) and originally described just 11 midsize cities outside of Greater Boston that were, and still are, struggling regional economic centers. These cities were major manufacturing hubs yet suffered from the same decline that beset much of the country in the decades since World War II. 
But they are also communities with assets – historic architecture, museums, universities, and walkable neighborhoods and downtowns – that make them attractive places for investment. They are home to nearly 40 percent of the state’s foreign-born residents, and for many, they are a “gateway” to the American dream.
In 2009 and 2010, Beacon Hill took note of these communities around the state and recognized the need to financially support their economic development efforts. The Legislature codified an official definition of Gateway Cities in state law and began setting aside funds to help redevelop the qualifying communities.
But despite lawmakers’ good intentions, the statute failed to create a clear enforcement mechanism to periodically review each city’s eligibility. Over time, some cities have met the state’s criteria without being added to the list, while others no longer qualify yet continue to reap the benefits. Beacon Hill hasn’t made changes to the list of qualifying cities since 2013. Since then, oversight of the designations seems to have been lost.
State statute defines a Gateway City as any city with a population greater than 35,000 but less than 250,000, a median household income below the statewide average, and a rate of educational attainment of a bachelor’s degree or higher that is below the state average. Under that definition, 24 cities originally qualified for the status under the law. But in 2013, former Gov. Deval Patrick’s administration added Attleboro and Peabody to the list after their median household incomes dipped below the statewide average, bringing the total to 26.
Today, those 26 former industrial cities continue to compete for tax credits and millions of dollars in housing and economic development funds from a number of programs that target Gateway Cities. Over the years, there have been many legislative attempts to revise the state’s eligibility criteria – none of which have been successful.

But there are three current Gateway Cities – Salem, Methuen, and Quincy – that do not qualify for the status under the state’s current criteria. Methuen’s median household income has just surpassed the state average. Data from the most recent five-year American Community Survey show that nearly 50 percent of Salem residents have a bachelor’s degree or higher – a bit more than the statewide average. In Quincy, nearly 49 percent of residents now have a bachelor’s degree or higher, just surpassing the state average.
Two cities – Weymouth and Marlborough – now meet all three criteria to be considered Gateway Cities under state statute, according to the Census Bureau’s most recent data, yet they are not reaping the benefits of the designation.
So, who is in charge of the designations? Beacon Hill doesn’t seem to know.
The statute doesn’t charge an office, department, or agency with periodically reviewing which cities meet the criteria, leaving no path for cities to be added or removed. It also doesn’t explicitly state which entity is supposed to enforce the law. However, the tax incentive program under which the legal definition of Gateway Cities was created – the Economic Development Incentive Program, which awards tax credits for job creation – is overseen by the secretary of economic development.
The Executive Office of Economic Development emphasized that it remains committed to providing funding and programs to Gateway Cities but argued that the statute does not authorize or require them to review which cities and towns meet the criteria. The office did not respond when asked if Secretary Eric Paley would rectify the situation.
State Rep. Antonio Cabral, a New Bedford Democrat who co-chairs the Gateway Cities Legislative Caucus, said even if a community meets all three criteria and wants to be considered a Gateway City, it needs to have a history of deindustrialization and should be a regional center of economic activity – even though those “requirements” are not actually written in the state law.
“Sometimes we read the so-called metrics or criteria too literally,” he said. “That historical designation is not written down in any way, but that’s part of the concept.”
It’s true that Marlborough and Weymouth meet the “letter” of the law, but when asked if they meet the “spirit” of the law, Cabral hedged.
“I think I would leave it in the form of a question. Do they think they meet that historical definition?” he said.
Cabral said he would be opposed to removing cities from the official list because they no longer meet all three criteria, arguing that it is in the state’s interest to continue investing in the development of those cities. But he also emphasized that funding for the 26 Gateway Cities is already limited, and programs like the Housing Development Incentive Program – a market-rate housing tax incentive program exclusively for Gateway Cities – are competitive enough as it is.
“My role is to make sure that we don’t keep dividing the pot. My role is to make sure that pot gets fuller,” Cabral said.
Sen. John Cronin, a Fitchburg Democrat who also chairs the Gateway Cities Legislative Caucus, had a different take.
“I am a proponent of addition,” Cronin said. “The bigger coalition that you can build of communities that are advocating together for equitable state investments, community development, and economic development benefits everybody in the state.”
Cronin argued that Quincy, Salem, and Methuen are proof that the state’s targeted grant programs and funding opportunities are working and have helped to create more mixed-income communities. In order for the definition of a Gateway City to change, or for a new city to be added, Cronin said the Legislature would need to act.
“There are more conversations happening in the Legislature now between members than I have seen in the past about whether we should increase the size or relook at what makes a Gateway City,” he said.
Cabral believes Gov. Maura Healey’s administration and the Executive Office of Economic Development are the ones in control of the policy, and legislation is not necessary. Healey’s office declined to answer questions about whether her administration would tweak the current list as former Gov. Patrick’s administration did in 2013.
All of this has left lawmakers like Sen. Jamie Eldridge, who represents Marlborough, confused. He told CommonWealth Beacon he is trying to understand how the city can officially be considered for the grants and benefits, but his questions have gone mostly unanswered.
“So far in our outreach to the Executive Office of Economic Development, there has been no point person for Gateway Cities to make this inquiry,” Eldridge said. “I’m trying to get more answers on what the Legislature plans to do on this, or the executive branch.”

Eldridge said the funding, grants, and tax incentives would be “significant” for Marlborough, which has struggled to build enough affordable housing.
Gateway Cities are eligible and prioritized for multiple state aid programs, including the Gateway Housing Rehabilitation Program, which provides funds to develop blighted residential properties, Greening the Gateway Cities, which provides grants to cities and nonprofits for tree planting, and the Transformative Development Initiative, which provides assistance and grants to support economic growth in Gateway City downtowns and commercial districts.
“There are current Gateway Cities that have become wealthier, and if the general idea is that a Gateway City is supposed to be prioritized because it’s either less well off or is unable to do the investments on its own, how does that impact the bigger discussion about how to most wisely use our taxpayer dollars?” Eldridge said.
Sen. Patrick O’Connor, a Republican who represents Weymouth, only recently realized the city meets the criteria after CommonWealth Beacon reached out. He said in an interview that he is excited about Weymouth’s eligibility, which could open the door to valuable economic development funding opportunities for the city.
“It’d be huge. We have one of the largest undeveloped parcels of land in the entire state … we also have no downtown in Weymouth,” O’Connor said. “We’re excited to learn about the process, or help in the creation of the process for that matter.” 
Recognizing that the statute is vague, O’Connor emphasized the need to “tighten up the process in which this all happens.”
“The long-term goal of the Gateway City designation is to … have growth and development inside of your community that will lead you, hopefully, to a point in time where the designation is no longer necessary,” O’Connor said.
Recently, lawmakers have raised questions and proposals seeking to define Gateway Cities in a way that encompasses more communities.
State Sen. Bill Driscoll, who represents the town of Randolph which has long hovered near the threshold of the state’s three criteria, introduced a bill in 2025 that would add two additional criteria – having a population makeup of at least 40 percent people of color and having 15 percent or more of households that speak English less than “very well.”
Municipalities meeting any three of the five categories would be considered a Gateway City. Under that definition, Randolph would qualify, but so would seven other towns and cities, including Boston and a town of less than 5,000 on the island of Martha’s Vineyard.
The bill would also charge the secretary of economic development with certifying which municipalities qualify after each decennial census and would give the office the ability to move a community on or off the list at any point mid-decade using annual estimates from the Census Bureau.
Another bill proposed in 2025 by Sen. Paul Mark – representing Berkshire County and the westernmost towns of Hampden, Hampshire, and Franklin counties – would allow two or more municipalities to combine to satisfy the first criterion, which requires a qualifying city’s population to be greater than 35,000.
The Legislature may be hesitant to add or remove cities from the list now. Two of the four most powerful people in the Massachusetts state government have ties to the Gateway Cities coalition.
Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll was the former mayor of Salem – a city that technically no longer qualifies for the designation. And in order for legislative action to be taken, House Speaker Ron Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka would need to be on board. But the speaker appears to be in the middle of the issue – literally. His district is made up of parts of both Quincy, a city that no longer qualifies, and Weymouth, a city that does. Mariano’s office declined to comment on the matter. Spilka did not respond to a request for comment.

Lawmakers’ longstanding desire for the cities and towns they represent to be considered for the opportunities set aside for Gateway Cities is nothing new. But when the term was first coined, there was some resistance it, according to John Schneider, interim president and CEO of MassINC at the time of the 2007 report. It was first seen as a negative label for low-income, struggling cities.
Schneider developed the “Gateway City” name to describe the communities in a positive way, rather than referring to them as “third tier” or “weak market” cities. They were and still are a gateway to the American dream and the middle class, he said.
“All of a sudden, these cities were being reframed as places of opportunity, so legislators wanted to define the communities in a way that resulted in more cities being designated as Gateway Cities and benefiting from the programs that were being developed,” Schneider said.
As for the three cities that no longer meet all three criteria, some have raised concerns.
The Patriot Ledger reported in June on local objections to a zoning change in Quincy that resulted in a new developer being eligible for significant tax breaks on a large-scale residential and retail project in the city center. The zoning change qualified the projects for tax incentives through the Housing Development Incentive Program. One resident compared the proposal to welfare fraud, arguing the tax breaks were unwarranted because Quincy is no longer a Gateway City by law.
If neither Healey, the Executive Office of Economic Development, nor the Legislature acts, the current list of Gateway Cities will likely remain unchanged.
“Just speaking to the financial realities of where the state is, I think there probably would be some concern about dramatically expanding which communities have that Gateway City status,” Eldridge said.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/000statehousedome.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-09 10:11:44.522246

The outcome will reach far beyond the state’s borders.
The trial, which will include testimony from abortion providers, Planned Parenthood leadership and anti-abortion doctors, will give an unusually detailed look at the inner-workings of abortion in Missouri, highlighting how just one or two restrictions on the procedure can greatly weaken access in a state where few providers remain.
Over the course of two weeks, the details of Missouri’s numerous abortion regulations will be under a microscope as those in favor of abortion rights argue that nearly every restriction is unconstitutional under the reproductive rights amendment and the state argues the regulations are necessary protections. 
The outcome of Missouri’s reproductive rights amendment case — which will either greatly broaden access to abortion in ways not seen in decades, or will hamper access for nearly everyone in Missouri — will reverberate far beyond the Show-Me State, said Rebecca Reingold, an associate director at the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law.

This is particularly true, she said, of states also in the process of litigating abortion access like Arizona, Michigan and Ohio.
“There is little doubt that advocates and decision-makers in other states navigating similar legal challenges are closely monitoring the litigation over Missouri’s abortion regulations,” Reingold said. “ … While state court judges are certainly not bound to follow the decisions of their peers in other states, these decisions can serve as persuasive legal authority, particularly in cases involving novel legal questions or where the relevant legal standards are evolving.” 
The result of Missouri’s lawsuit will also greatly affect the landscape of abortion access in the Midwest and the South. 
“Missouri also neighbors states with some of the harshest abortion bans in the country,” she said. “That means that the outcome of this litigation will be felt beyond the state’s geographic borders, affecting access to care not only for Missourians, but also people living in neighboring states.”
The case originated with a lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri the day after the November 2024 election in which voters narrowly approved broad abortion access, becoming the first state to overturn a near-total abortion ban through a vote of the people.
Maggie Olivia, a senior policy manager with Abortion Action Missouri, embraces abortion-rights supporters after the race is called in favor of Amendment 3 on Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024, in St. Louis (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
Amy Myrick, a senior attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said Missouri is a harbinger for other states attempting to secure abortion protections through constitutional changes.
“Missouri is a test case for what happens when the people have spoken and passed the constitutional amendment with the strongest possible protections, but the state still decides to stand in their way, and the courts have to decide what to do,” she said. 
Hypothetically, Myrick said, this should be an open and shut case because Missouri’s reproductive rights amendment was written with some of the strongest protections of any amendment in the country. The amendment prohibits the government from regulating abortion prior to the point of fetal viability unless “such action is justified by a compelling governmental interest achieved by the least restrictive means.” 
“So if courts start upholding restrictions against these kinds of protections,” Myrick said. ‘That’s a really bad sign.”
Right now, most of the targeted regulation of abortion provider laws, known as TRAP laws, have been temporarily enjoined — or paused — until a permanent decision could be made at trial.
This includes required distribution of Missouri’s informed consent booklet prior to an abortion; a 72-hour waiting period between an initial appointment and an abortion; and abortion facility licensing requirements. The injunction allowed Planned Parenthood to begin offering in-clinic abortions last February. 
Between then and October, 80 in-clinic abortion procedures took place in Missouri across Planned Parenthood clinics in Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis, according to data from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. In 2023 and. 2024, there were no elective abortions performed in Missouri. A few decades ago, prior to the passage of most of Missouri’s abortion restrictions and 2022 ban, thousands of abortions were performed in the state each year. Current data shows several thousand Missourians still accessed abortion in 2024, but had to travel to Illinois or Kansas to do so.
Abortion rights returned to Missouri one year ago. Access never did

Zhang did not enjoin two regulations that Planned Parenthood says are preventing providers from prescribing medication abortion: a complication plan approved by the state as well as supplemental insurance requirement. For this reason, Missouri doctors remain unable to prescribe the medications mifepristone and misoprostol to patients to end first trimester pregnancies. Medication abortion is the most common method to end a pregnancy in the United States, used in about two-thirds of abortions.
Anti-abortion advocates contend repealing these regulations could put women’s safety at risk. 
“Like Michigan and Ohio before them, the amendment was the first step, opening the door for the abortion lobby to tear down all of the health and safety standards for women’s protections that the Missouri legislature required over the years,” said Katie Glenn Daniel, director of legal affairs and policy counsel at SBA Pro-Life America.
Myrick said attempts to tie regulations to health and safety claims are nothing new. 
“Every single one of these restrictions is about hostility to abortion, making it harder to access abortion,” she said. “Even something like a complication plan can be a shutdown law if it’s impossible to comply with. So there’s no way this is about health or safety.”
She said Missouri anti-abortion leaders have long been creative, spearheading many of the national fights against mifepristone in particular. 
Stickers saying “repeal and replace Amendment 3,” the name of the 2024 reproductive rights amendment, are distributed during Missouri Right to Life advocacy day at the Missouri State Capitol in March 2025 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
In November, Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway sued over the latest approval of a generic version of mifepristone, asking the federal government to overturn the approval and to reinstate in-person dispensing laws for the medication, which can currently be prescribed in some states during telehealth appointments and then mailed to patients.
Last summer, Hanaway’s predecessor, Andrew Bailey, sued Planned Parenthood over its claims that mifepristone is safer to take than over-the-counter medications like Tylenol, penicillin and Viagra. 
And Missouri is now the lead plaintiff in a federal lawsuit seeking to limit the availability of medication abortion. The case originated in Texas and moved all the way up to the United States Supreme Court before the nation’s highest court said the original plaintiffs didn’t have the jurisdiction to sue.
Sarah Wetter, senior associate with the O’Neill Institute at Georgetown Law, said the transfer of the federal case to Missouri makes the state litigation beginning Monday “all the more threatening” as the Missouri Attorney General’s Office also prepares to argue against mifepristone at the federal courthouse in St. Louis.
“Turning back the clock to pre-2016 rules would limit mifepristone access to patients up to 7 (rather than 10) weeks gestation, require more in-person visits, and otherwise prohibit telemedicine abortion,” Wetter said.
Many high-ranking Missouri politicians have shown repeatedly that abortion remains among their highest priorities, with few saying they’ll back down if the abortion rights amendment is fully implemented following the trial. A prime example of this is the Republican supermajority’s success in putting a proposed abortion ban on this year’s November ballot. Plans are already underway to continue attempting to limit access to the procedure, whether the abortion ban amendment passes or fails later this year.
Politics are supposed to be left out of the courtroom, said Michael Wolff, a former chief justice of the Missouri Supreme Court and dean emeritus at the St. Louis University School of Law. He’s curious if that will be the case next week.
“The courts, in my experience in Missouri, have always been solicitous of what the voters were voting on,” he said.
Wolff, who advised in the drafting of the abortion rights amendment, said any arguments by the state that abortion regulations are necessary because Missouri voters didn’t realize the scope of what they were voting on should be heeded cautiously.
“Haven’t these political issues, these questions about the desirability of this law, already been litigated when they had to campaign where the voters approved (abortion)?” Wolff said. “ … It’s not a matter for the courts to decide whether the voters were dumb or or smart when they did this.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_8172-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-09 10:11:44.522246

In Connecticut, a commercial driver can have their commercial driver’s license, or CDL, suspended or disqualified after a DUI arrest in any vehicle, even before a conviction. 
For CDL holders, a DUI triggers a criminal court case and an administrative action by the Department of Motor Vehicles.
Under Connecticut’s process, the DMV can suspend a CDL if a driver fails or refuses a chemical test, or if test results show an elevated blood alcohol level. In most cases, the suspension takes effect within about 45 days unless the driver requests a DMV hearing, usually within 10 to 15 days.
A BAC of 0.04% — lower than the 0.08% needed by non-commercial drivers for a DUI — while operating a commercial vehicle can lead to disqualification. Refusing a test typically results in a one-year CDL disqualification, longer if hazardous materials are involved.

“The officer, fearing for his life and other officers around him and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots. He used his training to save his own life and that of his colleagues,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a news conference in Minneapolis.
A jury might very well disagree after seeing footage of the incident, like Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey who called ICE’s claim of self-defense “bullsh*t.”
But the Trump administration seems intent on blocking local prosecutors from even bringing charges against the ICE officer, who the Star Tribune identified as Jonathan Ross.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office took the unusual step soon after the shooting of ousting the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension from the investigation into the killing.
The BCA typically investigates police shootings in the state, and was on the scene in south Minneapolis on Wednesday collecting evidence as part of a joint investigation with the FBI.
Then the U.S. Attorney’s Office “reversed course” and decided the investigation would be led solely by the FBI, said Drew Evans, BCA superintendent, in a statement.
“Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands,” Evans said. “As a result, the BCA has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation.”
Gov. Tim Walz during a Thursday press conference expressed doubt about the results of any investigation conducted by the federal government because Minnesota officials have been purposefully excluded.
“Now that Minnesota has been taken out of the investigation, it feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome,” Walz said. “People in positions of power have already passed judgment … and told you things that are verifiably false.”
If federal investigators don’t share their findings with local prosecutors, they’ll struggle to put together a case to bring charges, said former Acting U.S. Attorney for Minnesota Anders Folk, who brought federal charges against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for killing George Floyd in 2020.
“I don’t know how any prosecutor could make a charging decision without facts,” Folk said. “The local authorities are going to have to figure out a way to do their own investigation if they want to be able to evaluate whether a criminal charge can be brought.”
Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty, who has jurisdiction in Minneapolis, said in a statement on Thursday that her office is searching for a way for a state level investigation to continue.
“If the FBI is the sole investigative agency, the state will not receive the investigative findings, and our community may never learn about its contents,” Moriarty said in a statement.
The FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office did not respond to requests for comment.
A spokesperson for U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who will make charging decisions based on the FBI investigation, pointed the Reformer to a post on X when asked if she has commented on the case and if she believes the use of force was justified.
“Obstructing, impeding, or attacking federal law enforcement is a federal crime. So is damaging federal property. If you cross that red line, you will be arrested and prosecuted. Do not test our resolve,” the post says.
Who might do a local investigation is unclear. Folk, who is now running for Hennepin County attorney, said he’s not aware of any cases of officers shooting someone in Minnesota in which the BCA was not involved.
“They are the law enforcement organization that we as Minnesotans look to do this kind of investigative work,” Folk said.
If the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office is able to complete a criminal investigation and file charges, they face another difficult task: convincing a federal judge that the ICE officer was not acting reasonably in carrying out his lawful federal duties.
If state charges are filed, the officer will likely ask to move his case to federal court to assert immunity under what’s known as the Supremacy Clause, which protects federal officials from state criminal prosecution if they are reasonably carrying out their duties.
Whether the officer’s actions are deemed lawful could hinge on a range of facts from his training to his duties to his subjective beliefs and the U.S. Supreme Court has provided only minimal guidance on how to answer that question, according to Bryna Godar, a staff attorney with the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School.
Still, she emphasized local prosecutors can and have brought charges against federal officials.
“The baseline understanding here is that states can prosecute federal officials when they violate state criminal laws,” Godar said.
If state prosecutors convince a federal judge the officer’s actions were not reasonable, they could continue bringing the case in federal court on state crimes. That’s significant because a conviction for a state crime cannot not be pardoned by the president.
Godar points in a recent article to cases going back to antebellum, when free states charged U.S. marshals for capturing enslaved people under the Fugitive Slave Act. During the Prohibition Era, local prosecutors charged federal officers for using excessive force in shutting down distilleries.
More recently, local prosecutors in Idaho brought a charge of involuntary manslaughter against an FBI sniper who shot and killed an unarmed woman during the siege on Ruby Ridge in 1992. A divided federal appeals court ruled that the case could proceed because of disputed facts over whether the agent acted “reasonably.”
“Where we see those state prosecutions going ahead is where the use of force is deemed unreasonable or excessive or unlawful,” Godar said.
But that case may offer a cautionary tale for Minnesota: The case wasn’t allowed to proceed until 2001, nearly a decade later. Then the case was dropped by the newly elected prosecutor.
Good’s killing was the ninth shooting by an immigration officer in just the past four months and at least the second killing, with all of them involving firing at people in vehicles, according to a New York Times report. On Thursday, ICE agents shot two more people in Portland, Ore.
In each of the recent ICE shootings, the government has claimed the officer was acting in self-defense.
A 2024 investigation by The Trace and Business Insider found in 23 fatal shootings by ICE officers from 2015 to 2021, no officers were indicted.
Minnesota prosecutors have won convictions in recent years against officers for killing people in the line of duty — Chauvin, Kim Potter and Mohamed Noor — but they are rare and juries are generally reluctant to convict.
Yet even if a conviction seems unlikely, filing charges allows local prosecutors to register a strong protest against ICE’s aggressive enforcement actions in the state and communicate that officers may not operate with impunity. Not charging would be an admission that federal agents are immune from local accountability as the Trump administration pushes for mass deportation.
Folk said a transparent investigation with clear standards is also important for the public’s faith in the justice system
“Minnesota has seen firsthand how important it is to do these high-profile investigations the right way,” Folk said. “We deserve a good, thorough investigation, free of any kind of influence.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260107_871-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-09 09:59:01.176377

Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, joined four other Republicans and the Senate’s Democrats in a 52-47 procedural vote that advances the resolution. If adopted, the resolution would direct the “removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities within or against Venezuela that have not been authorized by Congress.”
Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, was among the 47 senators, all Republicans, who voted against moving the resolution from committee and to the Senate floor. 
Both Murkowski and Sullivan supported President Donald Trump’s decision to launch an attack on Venezuela that seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife.
The country’s interior minister said Wednesday that 100 people were killed in the attack. Seven U.S. soldiers were injured, according to the Defense Department. Maduro and his wife appeared in U.S. court on Monday.
Since the attack, Trump has said he intends to take over the nation’s oil industry and direct Venezuela’s government.
In an interview with the New York Times on Wednesday, Trump said the only limit on his international powers is his “own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me.”
In a statement after Thursday’s vote, Murkowski said that only congressional authorization could permit American troops to remain in Venezuela.
She reiterated her support for the raid that removed Maduro, saying “Venezuela — along with the world — is better off without him in power.”
Many nations officially view Maduro as a dictator.
But Murkowski also said that the United States must have a “clear and achievable end goal” for the country after Maduro’s departure.
“Any future use of force or significant policy shift in Venezuela must include robust congressional oversight and authorization, consistent with our constitutional responsibilities, the rule of law, and a clear assessment of the benefits to the American people,” Murkowski said.
In December, Sullivan told the Huffington Post that he didn’t think having troops on the ground in Venezuela was a good idea.
If the resolution were enacted, the United States would be unable to legally have troops on the ground without congressional approval.  
He did not have a public comment on his vote Thursday, and a spokesperson referred to a statement he made Jan. 3, after the attack that ended with Maduro’s capture.
“The lessons learned from what took place after the United States deposed another Latin American indicted drug lord — Panama’s Manuel Noriega in 1989 — could prove useful, as could the painful and difficult lessons learned after the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003,” that statement said in part.
