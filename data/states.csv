The Ohio Housing Trust Fund was created in 1991 and is administered by the Ohio Department of Development. It is funded by a portion of the fees collected by county recorders, with half of the fees staying with the county and the other half going back to the Ohio Housing Trust Fund — which requires at least 50% of the funds be spent in non-urban areas.

“Through the Trust Fund, it funds homeless services, home modifications and repairs for homeowners, usually individuals who are aging,” said Coalition on Homelessness and Housing in Ohio’s Executive Director Amy Riegel. “It also provides gap financing for housing development and affordable housing development across the state.” 
The House budget proposal would remove the requirement for county recorders to send the Department of Development money to reallocate the funds, making it less effective across the state.
“Each county, whatever their receipts are, that’s the funding they have, and that’s all the funding that they have,” Riegel said. “It is a significant change.”
She was surprised to see this in the House’s budget proposal. 
“When the state is able to aggregate those dollars, they are then able to put it back out into communities where it is most needed at that time, and there are not enough resources,” Riegel said. “The Trust Fund could be 10 times what it is today, and we still wouldn’t be able to solve every housing issue across the state, but it is very effective, very useful dollars. … This is a program that actually works really well, that’s very strong, and we only have the hope to continue to strengthen it.”
Ohio is lacking more than 264,000 affordable rental units, according to the 2025 Gap Report released by the National Low Income Housing Coalition and coalition on housing and homelessness. Ohioans make at least $20.81 an hour working a full-time job to be able to afford a “modest” two-bedroom apartment, according to the 2024 Out of Reach Ohio report.
Ohio House lawmakers also nixed Gov. Mike DeWine’s Ohio Housing Investment Opportunity Program in the budget that would have invested $100 million in fiscal year 2026 to help increase single and multi-family housing in rural areas. 
“That would have helped individuals build all types of homes,” Riegel said. “I know that was something that the home builders have really advocated for, so disappointing to see that not included.”
The House’s proposed version of the budget would give the Ohio Housing Finance Agency $18.9 million for fiscal year 2026 and $19.6 for fiscal year 2027, the same as DeWine’s proposal. 
The House is set to vote on its version on the budget soon. The budget will then go to the Senate before going back to DeWine’s desk where it must be signed into law by June 30.

Meanwhile, a bipartisan pair of lawmakers are trying to prevent electronic benefit card fraud by equipping them with chip technology.
As the House released its proposed spending priorities for the next two years, its Agriculture Committee heard about plans to help Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants, and a rundown of the Ohioans who could be impacted by those changes.
“As a health care provider, I am acutely aware that food security is a fundamental social determinant of health,” said state Rep. Kellie Deeter, R-Norwalk.
Deeter and Rep. Tristan Rader, D-Lakewood, are co-sponsors of House Bill 163, which would enhance SNAP benefit cards with chip technology similar to that on most debit and credit cards.
According to the bill sponsors, $17 million in SNAP benefits were stolen from Ohio residents from June 2023 to January 2025. That money was reimbursed through a federal program, but that program ended in 2025.
“That means when SNAP benefits are stolen now, families will shoulder the loss,” Deeter said. “These are real Ohioans who suddenly find themselves without the means to buy groceries, through no fault of their own.”
Rader is also sponsoring a bill with Rep. Desiree Tims, D-Dayton, that would establish a state program to replace SNAP benefits for victims of electronic benefit theft, hoping to appropriate $17 million from the General Revenue Fund for that cause.
“This came through a conversation because I continue to get calls from constituents who have lost their benefits, often disabled veterans, often senior citizens, who are in a panic on how they’re going to access food because of the SNAP threat and the (electronic benefit transfer) theft,” Tims said.
In fiscal year 2022, Ohio households received $306 per month in average SNAP benefits. Households with older adults received $155 per month on average, according to research by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

In an analysis of state and federal SNAP data from fiscal year 2024, the center’s research showed that, of the nearly 1.4 million Ohio residents using SNAP, more than 43% are families with older adults or disabled individuals. That’s higher than the national rate of 37%.
Families with children make up the largest group, with more than 62% of SNAP participants falling into that category, the same as the national rate. The center also found that 35% of SNAP recipients are members of working families.
Legislators are fighting to see those benefits returned as the legislature debates cuts to hunger assistance even beyond the federal program, along with work requirements for SNAP recipients.
Ohio hunger budget
 
The SNAP work requirements in the Ohio House’s draft budget weren’t part of Gov. Mike DeWine’s executive proposal.
If the House’s version of the work requirements become law, the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services would be prohibited from “seeking, applying for, or renewing a waiver from the work requirements that apply to able-bodied adults without dependents,” budget documents say.
The Department of Job and Family Services also couldn’t implement a “federal option” to grant exemptions from SNAP work requirements, though the draft budget noted that SNAP benefits are funded by the federal government, so the work requirement doesn’t impact the state budget funds.
The House draft budget kept language from DeWine’s proposal regarding the assessment of SNAP participants who may be eligible for a work requirement waiver. The provision allows the state job and family services agency to refer participants in SNAP and the Ohio Works First programs who are “claiming a mental or physical illness or impairment” to the Opportunities for Ohioans with Disabilities office for “vocational rehabilitation assessment and support.”
Unless Ohioans are unable to meet minimum work requirements, as determined by the disability agency, they would be required to meet work requirements to receive benefits, according to the proposal.
The House budget also would require recipients to report “changes in circumstances that may affect eligibility for continued receipt of benefits” within 30 days of the change, a provision that also bars the job and family services department from “implementing simplified or quarterly reporting procedures for households receiving SNAP benefits.”
Food fight
Advocates for the hungry have said increased support for SNAP benefits is critical for Ohioans who need food assistance, especially as the current SNAP levels often need to be supplemented by food banks and other programs.
“The relationship between food banking and public assistance, particularly … SNAP, is relatively straightforward: SNAP provides more meals than we ever could,” said Hope Lane-Gavin, director of nutrition policy and programs for the Ohio Association of Food Banks, in testimony supporting another piece of anti-fraud legislation, a Senate resolution to urge Congress to restore stolen SNAP benefits.
Lane-Gavin also said significant changes in SNAP can affect “everything from the benefit allotment itself to changes in accessibility in the program’s application and interview.” Those changes are felt throughout the food assistance system, including food banks, she said.
“I offer that to say, even when the program is working as intended, for many Ohio families receiving SNAP benefits, the benefit itself is woefully inadequate.”
Food banks may have to brace for more cuts, as the House’s proposal chopped funding allotted to the Children’s Hunger Alliance via Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) dollars. DeWine’s executive proposal maintained the current funding of $7.5 million over the next two years, but the House proposal slashes it to just $3 million.
The alliance said in a statement that the reduction would cut 2.8 million meals throughout the state, and double the number of schools on a waitlist to participate in alliance programs.
“Across Ohio’s 32 Appalachian counties, children bear the brunt of hunger, and we provide food at 338 sites,” alliance president and CEO Michelle Brown wrote in a call-to-action email sent on Thursday. “In Columbiana and Athens counties alone, this cut represents about 150,000 meals.”
The Ohio Association of Foodbanks has previously pleaded with legislators to help, because the organization couldn’t afford to provide for another increase in hungry families in the state. Federal-level cuts could also be looming.
The House’s version of the budget took up DeWine’s proposal to earmark $44.1 million in TANF funds over the next two years for the association. The governor specified those funds should be used not only to purchase and distribute food, but also for SNAP outreach, along with summer meal programs, free tax filing services and “capacity building equipment.”
The budget also includes a proposal for a sub-grant agreement with the food banks association to distribute food to low-income families and support “transportation of meals for the Governor’s Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives Innovative Summer Meals program.”
Through the agreement, the association would be required to purchase food for state food programs, support a capacity-building grant program and pay for equipment for “partner agencies that is needed to increase their capacity to serve more families eligible under the TANF program.”
The Ohio Senate will draft its own budget before the House and Senate drafts can be combined and sent to the governor. The deadline for approval the state budget is June 30.

(Annie Wilson)Thousands of Kansans showed what bravery looked like on Saturday.
They filled the streets in Topeka, in Lawrence, in Wichita, in Kansas City and elsewhere. They marched, they chanted, they waved signs. They spoke out loudly against the unprecedented authoritarian threat emanating from Washington, D.C., where President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency have mangled constructional norms.
These thousands of Kansans showed, over the course of one inspirational day, that Americans will not roll over and accept a would-be dictator. For those who have hesitated to speak, or felt reluctant to share opinions, let these protesters inspire you.
Free speech will only die if we let it.
That same day, Kansas Reflector staff members appeared for a town hall at the Lawrence Public Library, sponsored by the Women for Kansas of Lawrence/Douglas County. Nearly 70 folks attended, many coming straight from the protest. While I could sense optimism and enthusiasm from the crowd, a dark river of fear still flowed beneath the surface. Not everyone in the United States, or Kansas, can count on their safety these days.
We have watched the government snatch students from the streets. We have seen visas and green cards rescinded on a whim. And those who previously wouldn’t have thought twice about traveling to or from the United States must now weigh the potential risks of doing so.

As columnist Eric Thomas wrote Friday, this complicates matters for those of us who work as journalists or train would-be journalists. Certain subjects — the Israel-Hamas war — and certain categories of people — immigrants, students, professors — have been targeted by the D.C. cartel. I couldn’t in good conscience tell a student on a visa from the Middle East to write about pro-Palestinian protests. As a journalist I would have to weigh carefully telling the story of an immigrant who might be the target of a deportation order.
In some situations, the risk might be worth it. But I wouldn’t want to make that decision for anyone.
As I told the crowd at the Lawrence library, this puts responsibility on the rest of us. My family has lived in the United States for generations. I’m still, as far as I know, a white male. That doesn’t mean I should take comfort in the threats emanating from our nation’s capital. It means that I — and others like me — have a greater responsibility to speak in support of those under threat.
Not that you would know from the lousy examples set by those in high places.
An epidemic of spinelessness has spread throughout this country’s power centers. You can hardly visit the website of a news organization without reading headlines like “‘The Terror Is Real’: An Appalled Tech Industry Is Scared to Criticize Elon Musk” or “Law firms refuse to represent Trump opponents in the wake of his attacks.” Closer to home, we have this one from yours truly: “Trump’s tariffs will wreck Kansas economy. Gutless wonders at the Statehouse won’t even protest.”



What do they fear? A mean tweet from a real estate developer? Primary election challengers? Losing a few dollars?



Our nation’s elites have picked cowering over courage.
What do the Saturday crowds prove? They proved that Americans have decided en masse to solve the collective action problem posed by the Trump administration. That means that while it’s in everyone’s best interests to resist, doing so individually carries too much perceived risk. So folks worked together.
Crowd of energized Kansans carrying homemade signs and showing their refusal to be cowed by one man in the Oval Office should give us all hope. Democrats, independents and, yes, Republicans should all cheer the use of peaceful, nonviolent protest (as covered by the First Amendment of the Constitution we all revere). We don’t want the alternative.
Most of all, though, this uprising should stiffen the spine and set the jaws of those who previously feared to speak. Your fellow Americans are worth it. Responsive government is worth it. The Constitution is worth it. Free speech is worth it.
Freedom is worth it.

When presidents try to make big changes through executive orders, they often hit a roadblock: A single federal judge, whether located in Seattle or Miami or anywhere in between, can stop these policies across the entire country.
These court orders have increasingly become a political battleground, increasingly sought by both Republicans and Democrats to fight presidential policies they oppose.
This explains why the Trump administration recently asked the Supreme Court to limit judges’ power to issue what legal experts call “nationwide preliminary injunctions.” Congress also held hearings on curtailing judges’ ability to issue the injunctions.
But what exactly are these injunctions, and why do they matter to everyday Americans?
 Immediate, irreparable harm

When the government creates a policy that might violate the Constitution or federal law, affected people can sue in federal court to stop it. While these lawsuits work their way through the courts – a process that often takes years – judges can issue what are called “preliminary injunctions” to temporarily pause the policy if they determine it might cause immediate, irreparable harm.
A “nationwide” injunction – sometimes called a “universal” injunction – goes further by stopping the policy for everyone across the country, not just for the people who filed the lawsuit.
Importantly, these injunctions are designed to be temporary. They merely preserve the status quo until courts can fully examine the case’s merits. But in practice, litigation proceeds so slowly that executive actions blocked by the courts often expire when successor administrations abandon the policies.
 More executive orders, more injunctions

Nationwide injunctions aren’t new, but several things have made them more contentious recently.
First, since a closely divided and polarized Congress rarely passes major legislation anymore, presidents rely more on executive orders to get substantive things done. This creates more opportunities to challenge presidential actions in court.
Second, lawyers who want to challenge these orders have gotten better at “judge shopping” – filing cases in districts where they’re likely to get judges who agree with their client’s views.
Third, with growing political division, both parties aim to use these injunctions more aggressively whenever the other party controls the White House.
 Affecting real people

These legal fights have tangible consequences for millions of Americans.
Take DACA, the common name for the program formally called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which protects about 500,000 young immigrants from deportation. For more than 10 years, these young immigrants, known as “Dreamers,” have faced constant uncertainty.
That’s because, when President Barack Obama created DACA in 2012 and sought to expand it via executive order in 2015, a Texas judge blocked the expansion with a nationwide injunction. When Trump tried to end DACA, judges in California, New York and Washington, D.C. blocked that move. The program, and the legal challenges to it, continued under President Joe Biden. Now, the second Trump administration faces continued legal challenges over the constitutionality of the DACA program.
More recently, judges have used nationwide injunctions to block several Donald Trump policies. Three different courts stopped the president’s attempt to deny citizenship to babies born to mothers who lack legal permanent residency in the United States. Judges have also temporarily blocked Trump’s efforts to ban transgender people from serving in the military and to freeze some federal funding for a variety of programs.
While much of the current debate focuses on presidential policies, nationwide injunctions have also blocked congressional legislation.
The Corporate Transparency Act, passed in 2021 and originally scheduled to go into effect in 2024, combats financial crimes by requiring businesses to disclose their true owners to the government. A Texas judge blocked this law in 2024 after gun stores challenged it.
In early 2025, the Supreme Court allowed the law to take effect, but the Trump administration announced it simply wouldn’t enforce it – showing how these legal battles can become political power struggles.
 Too much power or necessary protection?

Some critics say nationwide injunctions give too much power to a single judge. If lawyers can pick which judges hear their cases, this raises serious questions about fairness.
Supporters argue that these injunctions protect important rights. For example, without nationwide injunctions in the citizenship cases, babies born to mothers without legal permanent residency would be American citizens in some states but not others – an impossible situation.
Congress is considering legislation to limit judges’ ability to grant nationwide injunctions.
The Trump administration has also tried to make it expensive and difficult to challenge its policies in court. In March 2025, Trump ordered government lawyers to demand large cash deposits – called “security bonds” – from anyone seeking an injunction. Though these bonds are already part of existing court rules, judges usually set them at just a few hundred dollars or waive them entirely when people raise constitutional concerns.
Under the new policy, critics worry that “plaintiffs who sue the government could be forced to put up enormous sums of money in order to proceed with their cases.”
Another way to address the concerns about a single judge blocking government action would be to require a three-judge panel to hear cases involving nationwide injunctions, requiring at least two of them to agree. This is similar to how courts handled major civil rights cases in the 1950s and 1960s.
My research on this topic suggests that three judges working together would be less likely to make partisan decisions, while still being able to protect constitutional rights when necessary. Today’s technology also makes it easier for judges in different locations to work together than it was decades ago.
As the Supreme Court weighs in on this debate, the outcome will affect how presidents can implement policies and how much power individual judges have to stop them. Though it might seem like a technical legal issue, it will shape how government works for years to come – as well as the lives of those who live in the U.S.

Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
Federal cuts squeeze already-struggling food banks, school lunch programs

The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
 A mixed response from states

The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.










A lot of these farmers, they're living their dreams.


– Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture


“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
 Creating a new food system

In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
Democrats and Republicans take on soda, but they’re using different tactics

Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

(Getty Images)We “celebrated” April Fools last week, pranking, getting pranked or observing from a safe distance. I once wrote an April Fools column that ended up passed around on the floor of the Nebraska Legislature, prompted an angry call from the head of the Nebraska School Administrators Association and caused four subscribers to the Grand Island Independent to cancel their subscriptions. 
Geesh, who knew? I retired from the prankster game after that folderol.
Few, however, know that April 2, the day after our annual descent into tomfoolery is known as International Fact-Checking Day. The brainchild of the International Fact-Checking Network, which supports more than 170 fact-checking organizations, International Fact-Checking Day is held each year to remind us of the critical nature of getting the facts right, supporting honest public discourse, invalidating myths and underscoring accountability in journalism.
Libraries matter
Fact-checking has become a life preserver in today’s ocean of disinformation where we often find ourselves treading water to stay informed and afloat. In the modern maze one must navigate to find and embrace the truth, one place remains a bulwark against the propagandists: the library.
But now perhaps, librarians may be hobbled in their work. Among the president’s recent barrage of executive orders (109 as of April 1, including going after of all places, the Smithsonian) is the gutting of the small agency that supports American libraries and museums. The entire staff at the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) is on paid administrative leave, which may disproportionately affect small rural libraries and museums.
Nebraska has benefited from the IMLS. In an interview with The Conversation, Devon Akron, Director of the MSU Museum at Michigan State University said that in 2019 the IMLS awarded funds to libraries in Nebraska to support economic development in 30 rural communities. “The project created rotating “innovation studios” in local libraries and provided residents with tools, instructional materials and programming to foster entrepreneurship and creativity. The IMLS supports libraries of all types — public, academic, school and research … It is the only federal agency dedicated to sustaining the entire museum and library ecosystem in the United States.”
The American Library Association said the executive order “would decimate services such as early literacy development and reading programs, high-speed internet access, employment assistance, homework and research resources and accessible reading materials.” Its own internal research indicated that “89 percent of voters and 92 percent of parents believe local public libraries have an important role to play in communities.”
Trump administration defends cuts
The Trump administration said the cuts would “strengthen IMLS’s ability to serve the American people with integrity and purpose. President Trump was given a clear mandate by the American people, and his executive order delivers on that by reducing federal bureaucracy. This restructure is a necessary step to fulfill that order and ensure hard-earned tax dollars are not diverted to discriminatory DEI initiatives or divisive, anti-American programming in our cultural institutions.”
Mandate? At 49.81 percent of the vote? Seriously? And again with the DEI? What exactly was the “anti-Americanism” or “discrimination” or any other divisive behavior? Libraries and museums are by design filled with diversity in ideas, culture and art. They are at their best when they provide the truth, fire our imaginations, build communities and remain a repository of exploration and wonder for all ages, whether through a book, a computer screen, a class or the myriad of programs you can find.
Full disclosure: I am a lifelong fan of libraries, starting with the Carnegie Library in Grand Island where I checked out my first book as a little guy and where I loved spending time among the stacks of titles, the quiet like a friend, the musty smell of something old and important. I often spent time at the Fairfax Branch of the Los Angeles City Library during my decade in the City of Angels, browsing, reading and writing. And when I moved to Lincoln last fall, my first stop — before a new driver’s license or a utility account or a new dentist — was the library near my home for a new card.
My own biases aside, I’ve yet to see how cutting a small agency that supports libraries and museums could benefit Americans.
By the way, last Friday was National Tell a Lie Day, a fitting bookend to the week. But if you want to be sure your friend or coworker or state senator or congressman or president is telling the truth, I suppose you have a few options: Google, Facebook, TikTok, etc.
Or the one you can count on: a library.",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/library-books-3.jpeg,,,2025-04-07 04:58:09.658431

Mia Love and offer their condolences to her family. 
Love is survived by an extensive family including her husband Jason, daughters Abigale and Alessa, and son Peyton, who greeted guests at the Capitol as Love lay in state.
Love’s career was marked by important firsts, including being the first Black woman elected as mayor in Utah, when she was chosen to lead Saratoga Springs, and as the first Black Utahn elected to Congress. When she took her place in the U.S. House, she was the first Black Republican congresswoman.
She died March 23 at the age of 49 after battling a rare form of brain cancer.

As they shared memories of Love on Sunday, some who came to honor her recalled her energy for her work and her commitment to Utahns.
“Mia was, I think, groundbreaking in a number of different ways. She had the energy to do the job, but she wanted to do it in a way that made a difference to people and that meant representing all the people,” said Richard Piatt, Love’s former communications director. “She would meet with anyone that wanted to meet with her, and she made friends with a lot of people. I think that that’s probably one of her biggest legacies is that she didn’t mind taking on issues that she knew mattered to Utah, and mattered for the 4th District.”
Others described Love’s knack for connecting with those she met and her dedication to service.
“If you talk to just about anybody here, they will tell you that they were best friends with Mia. She was everybody’s best friend,” said DeLaina Tonks, a longtime friend of Love. “Her dad told her ‘You must give back.’ That was his thing that he told her after coming to the states from Haiti, and she has taken that to heart. That’s what she taught her children, it’s what she taught my children, it’s what she taught all of her friends is that we’re here to make a difference, to change the world and to make the world a better place.”
Love will be remembered in funeral services Monday at 10 a.m. at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints’ Institute building at the University of Utah. A live stream can be viewed on YouTube.

But with the Kentucky River expected to crest at a record level of 49.5 feet following several days of unrelenting rain, her family and friends worked Sunday afternoon to move couches, tables and more from the home along Murray Street.
Just a couple houses over, the swollen river had already partially submerged the homes of people Bobbitt, 64, says she knows from growing up together. The river’s expected crest Monday morning would beat the previous record by a foot if realized, according to a projection by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
“I just hate that all these people down here — we grew up with them,” Bobbitt said. “I just pray for our community.”

The state capital of Frankfort is one of a number of communities across Kentucky grappling with a deluge of flash flooding from torrential rainfall over the past several days — more than a foot of rain in some parts of the state — that’s now caused rivers to rise leading to evacuations along the Kentucky River in Frankfort and in the Pendleton County cities of Falmouth and Butler along the Licking River. 
In Carroll County, the deputy judge-executive Sunday afternoon ordered the mandatory evacuation of some areas because of a release of water from gates on Dix Dam along the Kentucky River. Robb Adams, the mayor of the Carroll County seat of Carrollton, in a livestreamed video on Facebook said the water release was planned.
Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear closed all state offices Monday given that flooding is limiting the available water supply in Frankfort, and he urged Frankfort residents to conserve water. The city utility Frankfort Plant Board in a Sunday morning Facebook post wrote electrical equipment used to pump water from the river had to be turned off due to the flooding and that the city was relying on water storage tanks.

The widespread flooding across Central and Western Kentucky has caused numerous roadway closures and has, so far, killed two people: a nine-year-old child was swept away by floodwaters in Frankfort and a Nelson County man was found submerged in his car. 
Ben Bramble, a 21-year-old lifelong resident of Frankfort, was moving furniture Sunday afternoon out of his rental duplex in the rain along East 3rd Street with the help of his family.

With the expected record river crest and floodwaters surrounding homes just a couple blocks away, he wasn’t sure what he will come back to when the river finally recedes. Bramble said flooding is a “recurring problem” for the state. But no matter how many floods you’ve experienced, there’s nothing to be done once you’ve been told to evacuate. 
“It’s going to be higher than we could ever have thought,” Bramble said. “I really just hope that we can come back to our house and have it still here.”

(Source: National Weather Service Little Rock)JONESBORO — Willadean Hergott of Jonesboro clutched a stuffed toy monkey while sitting in the Craighead County safe room in Jonesboro Friday evening and waited for the next round of storms.
“I don’t like tornadoes. I don’t like seeing what happened in Lake City,” she said, referring to a twister that smashed the western edge of the Craighead County town Wednesday evening with winds of 150 mph.
“You never know anymore where one will come up,” she said.
Hergott sat in a chair inside the shelter, which has a capacity for 600 people. She said she had the monkey for her grandchildren who would show up shortly.
At 5 p.m. Friday, there were already 60 people inside the shelter, which can withstand 250 mph winds. Storms did not reach Jonesboro until around 9 p.m. Friday. Large television screens inside the shelter showed live weather coverage from the local ABC television affiliate.
On Wednesday, more than 800 packed into the shelter. Deputies had to turn back another 200 people because it was overcrowded.
Rachael Townsend also went to the shelter Friday hours before the inclement weather hit.
She moved to Jonesboro about a week before a tornado hit the town on March 28, 2020, and is still shaken by the memory.
“I have PTSD,” Townsend said. “I have really bad storm anxiety. I can’t sleep at night anymore because of these storms.”
Townsend stayed in a friend’s storm shelter when the Lake City tornado struck. Lake City is about 15 miles east of Jonesboro. This time, she said, she sought safety early.
Storm anxieties have ramped up since early March when the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, forecast an extremely high potential for tornadoes in Arkansas on March 14. Twisters hit Cave City, Cushman and Diaz that evening, validating people’s fears. Three died in Cushman and 32 were injured in those storms, the Arkansas Public Safety Department reported.
Then, the March 28 tornado hit Bay, Lake City and Monette, injuring four people and damaging 25 structures. Another storm hammered Cross County Friday evening, and on Saturday, the National Weather Service issued tornado warnings for Craighead, Crittenden, Cross, Mississippi, Poinsett and St. Francis counties.
Torrential rains hindered cleanup efforts in the tornado-ravaged areas Saturday, but it also created record level river-flooding, adding to the mounting fears.

In Hardy, the Spring River rose to 23.5 feet by late Saturday afternoon. Flood stage there is 10 feet. Water covered a riverside park and lapped against railroad tracks that cut through the town.
“It’s the worst I’ve ever seen,” Hardy Fire Chief Joshua Moore said of the flooding. ‘”We had advanced warning this was coming since Tuesday, and we warned people that they needed to evacuate.”
Emergency officials did rescue two people trapped by high waters Saturday morning, he said. Rapids also washed out a train trestle in Mammoth Springs, he said.
“This has been a lot,” he said. “Four weeks ago, we had wildfires. Then we had the tornadoes on March 14, more wildfires and now flooding.
“As best as I can tell, people here are staying home and out of all the weather,” Moore added. “My guys are tired, but we’re not quitting.”
The White River in Newport, where the flood stage is 26 feet, is expected to crest at 33 feet Tuesday. The record stage there is 35.9 feet.
The Buffalo River in St. Joe is forecast to crest at 48 feet Sunday. Flood stage is 27 feet.
President Donald Trump issued a federal disaster declaration for much of Arkansas Saturday, releasing funds for cleanup and rebuilding. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders made the request in a 12-page letter earlier in the week, saying damage from the storms exceeded $11.6 million and estimated debris removal costs $3.7 million.
Sanders also released $250,000 from the state’s emergency fund for cleanup efforts.
In addition to the rains Saturday, the National Weather Service issued several tornado warnings in Craighead, Crittenden, Cross, Mississippi, Poinsett and St. Francis counties.  For the fourth time since the safe room first opened in the new Craighead County Courthouse Annex building in early March, people crowded into the shelter.
“There’s always a lot of hype with storms,” Craighead County Office of Emergency Management Director Anthony Coy said. “People post pictures all over Facebook and social media. There is massive community storm anxiety.”
He said storm chasers flood YouTube with videos of storms and the seeming constant live reports on local television add to the fear.
On Friday, scores of chasers swarmed into Arkansas in expectation of severe weather, increasing the already heightened fears of Arkansans.  One storm chaser, while live streaming his trip on YouTube, called out, “Here, ’nado, ’nado, ’nado,” as he drove through Newport.
“Fears and anxieties can be caused by a lot of variables,” said National Weather Service meteorologist Jeff Hood in North Little Rock. “Everybody reacts to trauma differently. They see the media pictures of all the damage from tornadoes every day lately. The media conveys how dangerous it is.”
He said it’s rare that meteorologists deal with the constant weather events like they’ve had this time.
“We were talking about that,” Hood said. “It’s been 10 or 20 years since we’ve had something like this. It’s not typical that we have something day after day after day.
“It’s unfortunate that we’re seeing all these ingredients line up like they’re doing,” he said. “Arkansas is in the wrong place at the wrong time.”

(Helaina Thompson/Courtesy of Over the Moon Farm)Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
 A mixed response from states

The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.
“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
 Creating a new food system

In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
A mixed response from states
The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.
“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
Creating a new food system
In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

Two new eastern Washington lawmakers from opposite sides of the political aisle paused just before the Legislature turned its attention to hammering out a budget to reflect on their first term. They told Inside Olympia host Austin Jenkins that it has been a whirlwind of learning, pressure, and unexpected appreciation for the work under the Capitol dome.
Rep. Natasha Hill, D-Spokane, and Rep. Brian Burnett, R-Wenatchee, bring vastly different life experiences to Olympia, but both describe their early days in office with humility and intensity.
“It’s not like anything that I’ve ever experienced before,” Hill said. “You’re really just getting your feet wet, learning from the folks around you, and learning as you go.”
Hill, an attorney and longtime advocate for equity in eastern Washington, said entering the Legislature during a time of fiscal crisis added weight to her role. “It’s been a very ominous experience, honestly. We know things are not good,” she said. “Coming in, it didn’t feel good at all. It felt like we’re not gonna be able to get anything new done, especially as a new member.”
Despite the challenges, Hill said she’s encouraged by the opportunity to serve and emphasized the importance of public input. “I didn’t realize how important it was — people to share their stories, to sign in pro and con on bills.”
For Burnett, a former Chelan County sheriff with 23 years in law enforcement, the shift from executive leadership to being one of 98 House members was jarring but ultimately rewarding.
“The first three, four weeks was just unbelievably [like] drinking from a firehose,” he said.
Burnett, who serves on committees including Community Safety and Appropriations, said he’s found purpose and a sense of community despite a steep learning curve. “Oh my goodness, I absolutely could say that I think I really love it. I can see that I fit in here, and I think I have something to provide, both legislatively, across both aisles.”
Burnett remains humble about what lies ahead. “I feel like I’m barely scratching the surface of what I have to learn,” he said. “You eat humble pie, and you learn from other people.”
Both lawmakers said they hope to continue building relationships and delivering results as their first term unfolds.

Sponsors this weekend’s “Hands Off” rallies include dozens of advocacy organizations, including the AFL-CIO, Americans for Financial Reform, Common Cause, the Consumer Federation of America, Indivisible, and Planned Parenthood.
As with last Saturday’s protest outside a Columbus Tesla dealership, many were protesting Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, whom Trump is permitting to slash federal programs and employees. They include the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Veterans Affairs.
“Trump Musk go,” said one sign. Others said, “Hands off science and scientists,” “Get the heil out,” Tax wealth, not work,” and “This penis party must end.”
But the major theme of the protest appeared to be a desire to protect democracy itself. 
“Not a paid protester,” said one sign. “My speech is free.”
That appeared to be a rebuttal to Musk’s claim that people are only protesting because they’re being paid by some unidentified boogeyman. He made that accusation even as he was handing out millions to Wisconsin voters in an attempt to sway and election to the state Supreme Court. He ended up losing badly.
Leslie Kern of Clintonville on Saturday said she felt a duty to protest at the Ohio capitol .
“I am so frightened that we’re going to lose our democracy that I decided that I had to come,” she said. “I heard a story this morning that the people who were deported to El Salvador were all deported illegally.” 
At least one man was improperly deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador after being accused without evidence of a gang affiliation, the Associated Press reported last week.
“It’s possible that a majority were not even associated with a gang. It feels to me like Berlin in 1938,” Kern said, referring to a time when thugs controlled by Adolph Hitler harassed, arrested and beat Jews and political dissidents and destroyed their property. “People are being snatched off the street by masked men and no one sees them again. A lot of people die in those prisons. And that was just this morning.”
Unlike some earlier protests, a healthy portion of the crowd Saturday appeared to be under 40.
Lilly Karhoff, a 17-year-old student at Hillyard Bradley High School, said she was protesting with an eye toward the future.

“This is the country we’re going to be living in,” she said. “Everybody needs to be aware of what’s going on. We need to preserve our democracy and our rights. It’s our democracy and the rights of everyone. Not just women. Not just children.”
She added, “I have many immigrant friends. Many Arab friends. Many Hispanic friends. This affects them and we talk about it.” 
But Kerhoff said administrators at her school won’t allow those concerns to be a topic of classroom discussion.
“There’s a lot of concern among our peers,” she said. “But unfortunately, our teachers have been instructed not to talk about the political climate, so we’re in a very limited environment. So I think it’s important to get out here and spread my voice.”
Kyra Milton, 21, of Columbus said her “whole objective is to stand against what’s happening to America, to our democracy. I’m just fed up with the way things are going and I’m not going to stand for it. I feel like our democracy is being attacked. Our rights. Our freedom of speech. Everything that humanity stands for is being attacked by the current administration.”
Despite all that, Milton said she’s optimistic.
“I feel like if we keep standing up like this, saying we know our rights and stand against them being attacked, we’ll have a better future,” she said.
Kurt Bateman, a member of the United Auto Workers, retired after 30 years of making parts for General Motors on the site where the Hollywood Casino now sits on Columbus’s West side. 
“They traded in middle-class-wage jobs for tip-wage jobs,” he said.
Among the issues Bateman was protesting were Trump’s attacks on organized labor. He added that the massive tariffs Trump implemented last week won’t achieve their stated goal of bringing back American manufacturing.
“We lost that battle in the 80s,” Bateman said. “They said, ‘We don’t care about making anything here. We’re going to financialize the economy.'”
Steven Stone traveled from Nelsonville to protest. Having served in the Army from 1969 to 1974, Stone said of Trump, “He’s not my commander-in-chief.”
“I’m here because the guy that’s supposedly our commander-in-chief called soldiers who died in combat ‘suckers and losers,'” Stone said. “He dishonored me and everybody who served in the military.”
Kern, of Clintonville, said she believed that protests such as the one on Saturday are one of the last tools for preserving American democracy.
“This and some courts are the last bastions standing against fascism,” she said. “Congress has fallen. Every institution of government that I thought would stand has fallen. So I feel like the people are the last bastion against fascism, and that’s the one voice that I hope still counts for something.”

The proposed restrictive definition says a wetland deserves protection only if it has a continuous surface connection to a navigable stream or lake. That [&#8230;],"The sun sets on the LaCreek National Wildlife Refuge near Martin, South Dakota, in April 2021. (John Deuter/USDA NRCS South Dakota, public license)Hundreds of thousands of acres of wetlands in northeastern South Dakota are likely to lose federal protection under the Trump administration’s proposed narrow interpretation of what water is important to preserve.
The proposed restrictive definition says a wetland deserves protection only if it has a continuous surface connection to a navigable stream or lake.
That leaves almost all of South Dakota’s 1.7 million acres of wetlands, which are home to about half of all threatened and endangered species, at the mercy of land developers and agricultural interests. 
A new report by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) shows the catastrophic loss of federal protections for wetlands across the United States. 
‘Wild places are worth fighting for’: Concern grows for receding South Dakota wetlands

Using Geographic Information System (GIS) modeling,  the model can zero in on specific counties. It shows that more than 70 million acres of wetlands — approximately 84% of the total area protected before the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 Sackett v. EPA decision — are left without federal safeguards. 
It also shows that nonperennial streams, which make up the vast majority of U.S. waterways and are essential for drinking water and flood mitigation, are also at risk. If only perennial streams remain protected, more than 8 million miles of U.S. streams could lose Clean Water Act protections.
Under the Trump administration’s definition, about 460,000 individual wetlands covering about 743,000 acres in northeastern South Dakota’s 10 most affected counties would be at risk. 
The most impacted counties in order are Brown, Beadle, Hand, Spink, Faulk, Edmunds, Roberts, McPherson, Sanborn and Hyde.
An additional threat is emerging in a lawsuit in Iowa that seeks to overturn the federal Swampbuster and Sodbuster provisions that tie wetland preservation to farm safety-net programs. Arguments were heard Monday in Cedar Rapids.   
At the federal level, organizations and individuals will have opportunities this month to voice their support for wetlands. The EPA has offered a general 30-day public comment period and a series of listening sessions.  
Schedules for states, tribes, industry and agricultural stakeholders and environmental and conservation stakeholders have been set from April 29 to May 1, but a listening session for the general public has not been announced. 
The odds of convincing the Trump administration to broaden its protection appear daunting.
In the Sackett decision, the court ruled that wetlands are protected by the Clean Water Act only when they have a “continuous surface connection” to other covered waters. It also held that other waters, like streams, are only protected if they are “relatively permanent.”
The Biden administration liberally interpreted what constituted a connection, but Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of Engineers are taking a strict approach, excluding most of what we think of as a wetland or marsh or protected streams. 
“Our analysis confirms that the Supreme Court has gutted the Clean Water Act’s ability to protect our wetlands, exposing communities to increased flooding, worsening water pollution, and threatening habitats that sustain wildlife and local economies,” said Jon Devine, freshwater ecosystems director at NRDC. 
In South Dakota, potentially “93 percent of wetland area and 99 percent of individual wetlands are predicted to lack protection,” the NRDC analysis said.
The National Wildlife Federation, which is the nation’s largest hunting and fishing conservation organization, is also voicing opposition.  
“This will be the fourth rule attempting to define the Waters of the United States in a decade. We need to stop playing political ping pong with this vital issue,” said Jim Murphy, the federation’s director of legal advocacy. “With the likelihood of a skeletal workforce at EPA, this move will put even more pressure and expense on states and localities to ensure our water is safe.”
For South Dakota, which does not have a state wetland program plan or a wetland monitoring plan, a resource so important to the state’s $1.4 billion annual fishing and hunting economy and quality of life appears as threatened as the species that depend on their life-giving waters.

The demonstration, organized by a wide swath of activist groups including the 50501 Movement, Bishop William Barber II’s Poor People’s Campaign, and the Union of Southern Service Workers, was part of a national day of protest that saw thousands gather in state capitals and major cities around the country. Protesters demanded the Trump administration take its “hands off” core social services such as Medicaid and Social Security as well as scientific research and international aid programs.
Speakers included veterans and union workers and brought together both longtime local advocates, like Rev. Rob Stephens of the Poor People’s Campaign, as well as those who only recently became engaged in politics, like high school junior Michael Turner, who came to the demonstration from Rocky Mount.
“They don’t care about the values that built this country, they don’t care about us,” Turner said of the administration, garnering cheers.  “We deserve leaders who fight for all people, not just the rich.”
“A couple of months ago, I didn’t even really want to be involved in politics,” said Aden Kalinowsky, whose sister depends on Medicaid for treatment of a rare genetic condition. “I don’t think it’s fair that they’re trying to take our Social Security from us. I don’t think it’s fair that they’re trying to take away our Medicaid from us.”
Eshawney Gaston, a food service worker in Durham with the Union of Southern Service Workers, demanded the administration take its “hands off my Medicaid.” She said her daughter requires specialized medical care and physical therapy because of her sickle cell anemia, health care Gaston would not be able to afford without help from Medicaid.
“We all have to stand up and fight together because health care is a human right,” Gaston said. “People don’t use Medicaid because they want to, I use it because I have to, because I can’t afford to do it on my own, because if I could, I would.”
While most of the discussion centered on national politics, North Carolina officials took heat from protesters as well, particularly Judge Jefferson Griffin, who has contested the state Supreme Court race for months via a bid to dispose of tens of thousands of ballots that on Friday received an affirmative ruling in the state appeals court.
“You need to know the names Phil Berger, Destin Hall — those are our leaders in the General Assembly who have been selling us out and have had the most corrupt government. The White House is taking all their cues from here,” Stephens said. “Yesterday, we know for sure that we don’t have a strong democracy, because Jefferson Davis — I mean, Jefferson Griffin — [is] trying to control who votes, who matters, and who has power in this democracy.”
Among the signs at the protest was a poster with the face of Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) captioned, “Where are you Thom? Do your job!” Another advised attendees to “Check the Griffin List,” the list of voters whose ballots are included in the challenge to the state Supreme Court race.






The demonstration doubled as a food drive, with John Freeman, a frequent organizer of Raleigh’s 50501 demonstrations, sharing the fact that organizers had raised roughly $4,000 for the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina. He said his group, the Iron Front of North Carolina, would also be distributing many canned goods and other food items collected at the April 5 demonstration.
Charlotte Ellis, a painter and former educator living in Louisburg, said she was motivated to participate in the protest by the administration’s cuts to schools. In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing the closure of the Department of Education, a move that has since been challenged in federal court.
“I want the schools to continue being funded and the teachers work really hard, and they’re trying really hard to do a good job, and they don’t need their funding cut, they need to keep their funding,” Ellis said. “All young children need to be trained to their full potential.”
Megan Bell, a participant in the national Women’s Marches under the first Trump administration, said she was “impressed and energized” by the crowd in Raleigh. “We don’t have much power right now, but we do still have our voices, and while we do still have them, it’s important that we use them,” she said.
Massage therapist Marvin Chambers said he decided to attend after seeing a flyer on a lamp post yesterday, joining demonstrations both in Durham and Raleigh Saturday. He said that while he was pleased with the turnout for the protests, he hopes people will “put their dollars where their voices are.”
Robert Shaughnessy, a machinist, condemned the “blatant disregard for due process of law, the Constitution, [and] the process of making, interpreting, and enforcing laws” by the Trump administration. He said it was “heartening” to see so many voice similar concerns at the Raleigh protest.
“There is no question whatsoever that the current administration has no compunctions about just bringing down steel on people who are law-abiding citizens,” he said. “Whether we like it or not, you have to meet steel with steel.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4051315-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-06 09:01:56.754062

In January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order pausing federal grants and loans, alarming HBCUs, where most students rely on Pell Grants or federal aid. The order was later rescinded, but ongoing cuts leave key support systems in political limbo, said Denise Smith, deputy director of higher education policy and a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a left-leaning think tank.
Leaders worry about Trump’s rollback of the Justice40 Initiative, a climate change program that relied on HBCUs to tackle environmental justice issues, she said. And there’s uncertainty around programs such as federal work-study and TRIO, which provides college access services to disadvantaged students.

“People are being mum because we’re starting to see a chilling effect,” Smith said. “There’s real fear that resources could be lost at any moment — even the ones schools already know they need to survive.”
Most students at HBCUs rely on Pell Grants or other federal aid, and a fifth of Black college graduates matriculate from HBCUs. Other minority-serving institutions, known as MSIs, that focus on Hispanic and American Indian populations also heavily depend on federal aid.
“It’s still unclear what these cuts will mean for HBCUs and MSIs, even though they’re supposedly protected,” Smith said.
States may be unlikely to make up any potential federal funding cuts to their public HBCUs. And the schools already have been underfunded by states compared with predominantly white schools.










There’s real fear that resources could be lost at any moment — even the ones schools already know they need to survive.


– Denise Smith, deputy director of higher education policy and a senior fellow at The Century Foundation


Congress created public, land-grant universities under the Morrill Act of 1862 to serve the country’s agricultural and industrial industries, providing 10 million acres taken from tribes and offering it for public universities such as Auburn and the University of Georgia. But Black students were excluded.
The 1890 Morrill Act required states to either integrate or establish separate land-grant institutions for Black students — leading to the creation of many HBCUs. These schools have since faced chronic underfunding compared with their majority-white counterparts.

‘None of them are equitable’

In 2020, the average endowment of white land-grant universities was $1.9 billion, compared with just $34 million for HBCUs, according to Forbes.
There are other HBCUs that don’t stem from the 1890 law, including well-known private schools such as Fisk University, Howard University, Morehouse College and Spelman College. But more than three-fourths of HBCU students attend public universities, meaning state lawmakers play a significant role in their funding and oversight.
Marybeth Gasman, an endowed chair in education and a distinguished professor at Rutgers University, isn’t impressed by what states have done for HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions so far. She said she isn’t sure there is a state model that can bridge the massive funding inequities for these institutions, even in states better known for their support.
“I don’t think North Carolina or Maryland have done a particularly good job at the state level. Nor have any of the other states. Students at HBCUs are funded at roughly 50-60% of what students at [predominately white institutions] are funded. That’s not right,” said Gasman.
“Most of the bipartisan support has come from the U.S. Congress and is the result of important work by HBCUs and affiliated organizations. I don’t know of a state model that works well, as none of them are equitable.”

Under federal law, states that accept federal land-grant funding are required to match every dollar with state funds.
But in 2023, the Biden administration sent letters to 16 governors warning them that their public Black land-grant institutions had been underfunded by more than $12 billion over three decades.
Tennessee State University alone had a $2.1 billion gap with the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
At a February meeting hosted by the Tennessee Black Caucus of State Legislators, Tennessee State interim President Dwayne Tucker said the school is focused on asking lawmakers this year for money to keep the school running.
Otherwise, Tucker said at the time, the institution could run out of cash around April or May.
“That’s real money. That’s the money we should work on,” Tucker said, according to a video of the forum.
In some states, lawsuits to recoup long-standing underfunding have been one course of action.
In Maryland, a landmark $577 million legal settlement was reached in 2021 to address decades of underfunding at four public HBCUs.
In Georgia, three HBCU students sued the state in 2023 for underfunding of three HBCUs.
In Tennessee, a recent state report found Tennessee State University has been shortchanged roughly $150 million to $544 million over the past 100 years.
But Tucker said he thinks filing a lawsuit doesn’t make much sense for Tennessee State.
“There’s no account payable set up with the state of Tennessee to pay us $2.1 billion,” Tucker said at the February forum. “And if we want to make a conclusion about whether [that money] is real or not … you’re going to have to sue the state of Tennessee, and I don’t think that makes a whole lot of sense.”

Economic anchors

There are 102 HBCUs across 19 states, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands, though a large number of HBCUs are concentrated in the South.
Alabama has the most, with 14, and Pennsylvania has the farthest north HBCU.

Beyond education, HBCUs contribute roughly $15 billion annually to their local economies, generate more than 134,000 jobs and create $46.8 billion in career earnings, proving themselves to be economic anchors in under-resourced regions.
Homecoming events at HBCUs significantly bolster local economies, local studies show. North Carolina Central University’s homecoming contributes approximately $2.5 million to Durham’s economy annually.
Similarly, Hampton University’s 2024 homecoming was projected to inject around $3 million into the City of Hampton and the coastal Virginia region, spurred by increased visitor spending and retail sales. In Tallahassee, Florida A&M University’s 2024 homecoming week in October generated about $5.1 million from Sunday to Thursday.
Their significance is especially pronounced in Southern states — such as North Carolina, where HBCUs account for just 16% of four-year schools but serve 45% of the state’s Black undergraduate population.
Smith has been encouraged by what she’s seen in states such as Maryland, North Carolina and Tennessee, which have a combined 20 HBCUs among them. Lawmakers have taken piecemeal steps to expand support for HBCUs through policy and funding, she noted.
Tennessee became the first state in 2018 to appoint a full-time statewide higher education official dedicated to HBCU success for institutions such as Fisk and Tennessee State. Meanwhile, North Carolina launched a bipartisan, bicameral HBCU Caucus in 2023 to advocate for its 10 HBCUs, known as the NC10, and spotlight their $1.7 billion annual economic impact.
“We created a bipartisan HBCU caucus because we needed people in both parties to understand these institutions’ importance. If you represent a district with an HBCU, you should be connected to it,” said North Carolina Democratic Sen. Gladys Robinson, an alum of private HBCU Bennett College and state HBCU North Carolina A&T State University.
“It took constant education — getting folks to come and see, talk about what was going on,” she recalled. “It’s like beating the drum constantly until you finally hear the beat.”

For Robinson, advocacy for HBCUs can be a tough task, especially when fellow lawmakers aren’t aware of the stories of these institutions. North Carolina A&T was among the 1890 land-grant universities historically undermatched in federal agricultural and extension funding.
The NC Promise Tuition Plan, launched in 2018, reduced in-state tuition to $500 per semester and out-of-state tuition to $2,500 per semester at a handful of schools that now include HBCUs Elizabeth City State University and Fayetteville State University; Western Carolina University, a Hispanic-serving institution; and UNC at Pembroke, founded in 1887 to serve American Indians.
Through conversations on the floor of the General Assembly, and with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, Robinson advocated to ensure Elizabeth City State — a struggling HBCU — was included, which helped revive enrollment and public investment.
“I’m hopeful because we’ve been here before,” Robinson said in an interview.
“These institutions were built out of churches and land by people who had nothing, just so we could be educated,” Robinson said. “We have people in powerful positions across the country. We have to use our strength and our voices. Alumni must step up.
“It’s tough, but not undoable.”
Meanwhile, other states are working to recognize certain colleges that offer significant support to Black college students. California last year passed a law creating a Black-serving Institution designation, the first such title in the country. Schools must have programs focused on Black achievement, retention and graduation rates, along with a five-year plan to improve them. Sacramento State is among the first receiving the designation.
And this session, California state Assemblymember Mike Gipson, a Democrat, introduced legislation that proposes a $75 million grant program to support Black and underserved students over five years through the Designation of California Black-Serving Institutions Grant Program. The bill was most recently referred to the Assembly’s appropriations committee.

The farm was one of thousands benefiting from a local food program recently cut by the Trump administration. (Helaina Thompson/Courtesy of Over the Moon Farm)Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
Federal cuts squeeze already-struggling food banks, school lunch programs

The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.

Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
 A mixed response from states

The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.










A lot of these farmers, they're living their dreams. 


– Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture


“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
 Creating a new food system

In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
Democrats and Republicans take on soda, but they’re using different tactics

Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

Mark Amodei.

((Photo by Hugh Jackson/Nevada Currernt)The one Nevadan who is in the best position to help stop Donald Trump from sabotaging the global economy and shattering the financial stability of Nevada households is Nevada’s only Republican in the Republican-controlled Congress, Rep. Mark Amodei.
Politico reported Friday that Amodei’s fellow House Republican, Don Bacon of Nebraska, plans to introduce a House version of a bipartisan-backed Senate bill empowering Congress to cancel tariffs ordered by a president.
The Senate version of the bill was announced Thursday by Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley and Washington Democrat Maria Cantwell, and four more Senate Republicans have signed on as co-sponsors so far.
Congress reining in Trump on tariffs (and, for a change, protecting and preserving the legislative branch’s role in the U.S. government) is a tremendously tall order. Even if Congress passed it, Trump would veto it, and then a whole lot more Republicans would have to find the spine to stand up to Trump and help form the two-thirds majorities in both houses needed to override a veto.
Yes, that many Republicans defying Trump seems unthinkable.
But then, just less than a week ago, the notion that the stock market would see one of its worst weeks ever just because of the crackpot obsessions of one 78-year-old man seemed unthinkable too.
When the markets plummeted upon opening Thursday, Bacon was already reportedly mulling some sort of House action to rein in Trump on tariffs. I emailed Amodei’s office asking if he had been in conversations with other House members about taking action to reassert congressional authority over tariff policy and whether Amodei agreed (as Bacon had put it) that “Congress should take back its tariff authorities.”

In a statement provided by his office Friday, Amodei ignored the question. Instead, he tossed around some Trump talking points and brushed off “Wall Street wigging out.”
“We’ll be closely monitoring key indicators of economic stability,” Amodei added, “such as job reports, inflation, and consumer spending, but nobody said this was going to be instant gratification, and as the President said, ‘We’re dealing with a very sick patient.’ Under Biden, we saw the largest trade deficit in U.S. history, and the status quo is simply not sustainable. We need significant changes to steer our country toward self-reliance.”
A couple things:
First, really, Amodei? “Nobody said this was going to be instant gratification”? Fine, let’s give Amodei the benefit of the doubt and assume he was talking about “instant gratification” as a result of Trump’s tariffs. But let’s also not forget that while campaigning Trump promised that “Starting on Day 1, we will end inflation and make America affordable again,” as well as “Prices will come down. You just watch: They’ll come down, and they’ll come down fast.” Trump has been promising nothing but instant economic gratification for the last, oh, three years. And so far he’s delivered exactly the opposite of that.
Second, when Amodei says 2024’s trade deficit is the largest ever, he’s presumably referring to a dollar amount, which is the dumbed-down way of looking at it. Each and every year countless measurements are the largest in history, like the world’s population, for instance, or, say, the sum total of inane hyperbole spewed by Republican members of Congress. Rather than a dollar amount, a far more concrete and informative assessment of the trade deficit is determined by measuring it as a percentage of GDP. In 2024 the trade deficit was 3.1% of GDP, while in 2006 it was more than 5%. But thanks for bringing it up, congressman.
Meanwhile, to reiterate, Amodei failed to answer the question he was asked, which essentially boils down to whether he too, like at least a half dozen of his fellow Republicans in Congress (Bacon and five senators), is ready to take the U.S. Constitution seriously and reestablish the legislative branch of the United States government as, you know, a going concern.
Courts are slow, and the Supreme Court is stuffed with Trumpers. Congressional Democrats are sidelined (and many of them, including Nevada ones, have demonstrated a willingness to pretend everything will be fine).  And Republicans have majorities in Congress, though to clarify, they don’t really control it; they’ve surrendered their control to Trump.
But assuming Trump can be reined in, a number of congressional Republicans are going to have to participate in the reining.
Some of the damage Trump has already inflicted on the economy, the rule of law, national security, international cooperation, science, human rights, the First Amendment, the system of checks and balances that underly the Constitution, democracy, and the practical workings of the federal government is so severe that fixing what he has broken will take years, assuming it’s fixable.
It’s tempting to write off Amodei, in the expectation that he’ll just continue to pretend this is all normal while supplying rote apologies for Trump laced with aw shucks quips and mealy-mouthed let’s-wait-and-sees.
But over the years Amodei has demonstrated on occasion there might be more to him than that. Since he’s the state’s only Republican in Congress, Nevada better hope there is.

Nessel was speaking during a “Hands Off!” protest organized by the 50501 Movement and various statewide groups, including civil rights organizations, labor unions, LGBTQ+ advocates, veterans, and fair-elections activists. ​It was one of 55 rallies planned to take place in Michigan at the same time as more than 1,000 protests nationwide. Rallies in Michigan were also organized in cities including Detroit, Grand Rapids, Traverse City and Marquette.
Nessel offered a stark warning to the protesters, predicting that Trump would order the U.S. military to target citizens who speak out against the administration.
“We will not capitulate. We will not act as appeasers. We will not bow down,” Nessel said. “And when Trump invariably invokes the Insurrection Act and commands the National Guard and the military to train their weapons upon us, we will let them know that when they took an oath to defend the United States against enemies, both foreign and domestic, that means Donald Trump and his accomplices, not all of us.”

The Democratic attorney general said that the United States is already “in the midst of a constitutional crisis” as Trump “has been thumbing his nose at the courts, disparaging judges and their rulings and completely violating court orders.”

“Trump and his lawless, corrupt and chaotic administration can ignore court orders, but they cannot ignore all of us,” Nessel said. “This is our state, our country, our democracy, and we will not relinquish it to a wannabe dictator, tyrant king.”
Nessel said she began suing the Trump administration on his second day back in office, and vowed to continue suing him “each and every damn time he violates the law and injures our state.”

“Donald Trump seems to believe that he has a mandate to cripple our nation, violate the law and throw out the Constitution, because he won this state by 80,000 votes,” Nessel said. “I want to say that I won this state by 370,000 votes, and unlike Donald Trump, when I swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, I actually read it, and I definitely meant it.”
Deputy Secretary of State Aghogho Edevbie, who is running for secretary of state as a Democrat, pointed to Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election as an example of the threat he poses, noting that Trump has been talking about seeking a third term—which he has no constitutional power to do.

“There is nothing that will stop Donald Trump from trying to destroy this country for his own personal gain, and he’s at it again,” Edevbie said.
“We’re going to either stand up and fight, or we’re going to let Trump become a dictator and a king.”
Edevbie noted that Michigan voters have approved numerous changes to the state’s election laws in recent elections, with ballot proposals passing by wide margins of support.
“When we rise above the lies, when we rise above the bulls—t, when we rise above misinformation, we win,” Edevbie said.
The rallies taking place throughout the country Saturday were meant to oppose Trump and Elon Musk’s sweeping changes to the federal government, which include “everything they can get their hands on,” according to a statement from organizers.
Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, who announced a campaign for governor last month, said that while there are areas where government can be more efficient, the Trump administration does not have the mindset to propose real solutions.
“I’m tired of people who claim they serve but only serve themselves,” Gilchrist said. “I’m tired of an administration that wakes up and, before they eat breakfast, they figure out who they can fire, they figure out whose healthcare they can strip, they figure out what veteran can’t get their benefits, and they figure out who doesn’t get their Social Security.”

Former U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow said that the Trump administration is “embracing an agenda of revenge, racism, power and greed.”
Gilchrist estimated that there were more than 7,000 people in attendance at the rally, making it one of the largest since Trump took office in January.
Former Wayne County Health Director Abdul El-Sayed, who resigned from his position earlier this week to explore a possible campaign for Michigan’s open U.S. Senate seat, called back to his standard stump speech when he was a candidate in the Democratic primary for governor in 2018.
“I ran on this idea that Donald Trump wasn’t himself the disease, he was the worst symptom of the disease. And unless we were willing to take on the symptom and the disease, that that symptom would come back,” El-Sayed said. “And I hate to say it, we did do something about the symptom, but guess what? Disease came roaring back. And that’s what we’re living through right now.”
El-Sayed said his parents immigrated to the U.S. from Egypt, adding, “I love immigrants. But there’s just this one that I got some issues with,” referring to Musk.
“That boy came over here, he took billions of dollars of our government money to support companies that he didn’t even start, and now he wants to kill government for the rest of us,” El-Sayed said.
“You know how many times I’ve been told to go back to my country? I was born and raised here. Elon can go on and go back to his country.”

Meanwhile, more than 2,000 people gathered in Midtown Detroit on Saturday for a protest organized by the Hands Off! Detroit Fights Back coalition. The marchers chanted “Show me what democracy looks like. This is what democracy looks like” as they started at the Detroit Institute of Arts and ended near Little Caesars Arena, walking a three-mile route through the city.
The group criticized President Donald Trump, as well as billionaire and head of the Department of Government Efficiency Elon Musk, accusing them of harming public services, workers’ rights, and data privacy.
“Donald Trump and Elon Musk think this country belongs to them. Detroit is fighting back!” the coalition said in a press release. “They’re taking everything they can get their hands on… and daring the world to stop them.”
Organizers said the protest was part of a larger movement to resist policies they see as a threat to democracy and working-class communities.

Critics want lawmakers to ban the burgeoning online business they consider a racket, arguing that it undermines the fine-dining experience and could potentially leave restaurants with empty tables. However, proponents of the practice say it benefits both diners and restaurants when done properly. 
Some iconic restaurants topped the list during a recent scan of the New Orleans section of Appointment Trader, one of several platforms designed to let people with scheduling conflicts sell highly coveted reservations on the open market. A Saturday night reservation at Brennan’s later this month is available for a suggested bid of $235 — a discount compared to the whopping $2,138 someone paid for a four-top at Antoine’s during the Super Bowl weekend. 
Are those prices based on genuine demand for seating at the restaurants, or is it artificially inflated by technology built to cash in on wealthy tourists desperate to dine in the city’s elite culinary corners?
That’s a question Louisiana lawmakers will try to answer in the coming months as they consider House Bill 90, sponsored by Rep. Troy Hebert, R-Lafayette. The legislation could ban companies such as Appointment Trader, Dorsia and Wuw Wuw from operating in Louisiana. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Specifically, Hebert’s bill prohibits third-party companies from offering or arranging reservations at any restaurants that have not agreed to the service through a contract. 
Hebert could not be reached for comment, but the Louisiana Restaurant Association, a trade group that asked Hebert to file the legislation, said it is modeled after similar laws recently enacted in other states such as New York. They all describe the legislation as a measure to prevent “restaurant reservation fraud.” 
Appointment Trader, founded in 2021, lets users buy and sell reservations and appointments of all kinds through auction-style bidding. Sellers can set their own asking prices, and bidders can make offers at any rate. Additionally, prospective buyers can use the platform as a concierge service, offering a fee to any user who can secure them a reservation at a particular establishment. 
In its early days, the platform was limited mostly to hotspots such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Las Vegas. It has since gained popularity and expanded into smaller markets including New Orleans and virtually anywhere else one has a reservation they want to sell. As of Thursday, the platform had clocked over $6 million in trades within the last 12 months. 
In a phone interview, Louisiana Restaurant Association spokeswoman Wendy Waren said platforms like Appointment Trader are selling reservations without the restaurants’ permission or knowledge. If no one buys the reservations, tables just sit empty, which can cause seating delays or prevent genuine customers from getting a reservation and actually bringing business to the restaurant, she said. 
“It creates artificial scarcity,” Waren said. “It’s like somebody’s hijacking the process.”
‘Our backs are really against the wall’: New Orleans restaurants brace for new tariffs

New York hospitality trade groups have accused the platforms of using software bots to snap up reservations and sell them on what they call a “black market.” 
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey said he is just trying to solve a problem with a legitimate service that can benefit all parties, particularly the restaurants. The 37-year-old software engineer is a German immigrant who came to the U.S. five years ago and came up with the idea for his platform while waiting in a long line at his local motor vehicles office in Las Vegas. He now lives in Miami with his wife and is serious about maintaining legitimacy on his platform, he said.  
“I’ve basically lived in a computer all my life, and nothing gives me more joy — well almost nothing — than when thousands of people use the software I built to solve a problem in their life,” Frey said. 
In phone interviews this week, Frey explained how users on his platform must sell at least half of the reservations that they post or risk account suspension. This prevents people from trying to book all the available tables and hoard them to create artificial demand. Also, the free-market style platform means that unsold reservations put downward pressure on the prices in a given area, he said.
The app is still quite new in the New Orleans market as there have only been a handful of transactions, so the current 90-day average bid prices have been skewed by reservations sold during special events such as the Super Bowl. Frey said those “one-offs” are not the norm. 
In a market such as New Orleans, diners can typically get reservations without paying if it’s a normal weekend, but it can be next-to-impossible at certain restaurants in other big cities across the country. Reservation trading lets people sell valuable bookings that they, for whatever reason, can’t use or no longer want. 
When someone has a coveted reservation but encounters a scheduling conflict that prevents them from using it, they might not bother calling to cancel, leading to what restaurants call “no-show reservations.” 
  Jonas Frey, founder of Appointment Trader. (Submitted)
Just a few no-shows can disrupt a restaurant’s operations and cost it thousands in lost sales. Approximately 28% of American diners have admitted to ghosting on their reservations, according to a 2021 OpenTable survey.
“Wouldn’t it be better for everyone if you could just resell it?” Frey asked.
Lisa Blount, director of marketing for Antoine’s, said she’s all in favor of entrepreneurs figuring out new ways to make money in the restaurant industry. She’s less worried about no-shows because Antoine’s requires credit cards to make reservations, but she does have a few other concerns.
At Antoine’s and other fine dining eateries, the staff take a lot of time to learn about their customers when they make a reservation, Blount said. They might be on a tight schedule, have diet restrictions or could be visiting for a special occasion. This kind of information allows the restaurant to make preparations with food ordering, shift scheduling and other arrangements.
“There’s a lot more to coming to our restaurant than just buying a ticket,” Blount said. “We try to know a lot about you before you even get in the door.” 
Blount said she worries that trading or selling reservations to unknown customers could stymie a restaurant’s ability to offer its best level of service. She also said she hates the idea of an unwitting customer paying for a reservation and then showing up and seeing empty tables because it turned out to be a slow evening. The customer would feel scammed, and it could damage the restaurant’s reputation, she said. 
Still, Blount said she’s open to the concept of reservation trading if there are ways to control for those kinds of issues.
Frey said he is actively trying to partner with restaurants to make the app better for all parties. His platform currently takes a 30% cut of each transaction, and he offers partner restaurants an equal share of the net proceeds. So far, Frey said he has not landed any partnership agreements as he tries to keep his company alive through an onslaught of state legislation.

Bans on reservation trading apps are already in place in New York and Arizona, and a similar bill is currently pending in the Illinois legislature.
Some large corporations could lose a chunk of their business if reservation trading catches on. Restaurant booking platforms such as OpenTable and Resy make money by charging restaurants a fee for every reservation customers make through their app. 
Platforms like Appointment Trader threaten to disrupt the online booking sector by flipping that business model on its head. Under Frey’s partnership model, restaurants would get paid just to let customers inside. 
But all that depends on genuine demand existing in a particular market area. 
“There’s so many restaurants here,” Blount said from her New Orleans office. “We’re not New York.”

(Safura Syed/Verite News)NEW ORLEANS – Hundreds of people gathered in Lafayette Square for a rally against the Trump administration Saturday afternoon. The protest was a part of a national mass mobilization effort, Hands Off, which advocates against cuts to government services like Social Security and loss of protections for marginalized groups.
The first three months of President Donald Trump’s administration have been marked by uncertainty as the president and Elon Musk cut funding to various government agencies and laid off hundreds of workers. Around 20% of revenue in the New Orleans city budget for 2025 comes from federal funds. Statewide, the reliance on federal dollars is even larger, making up around 50% of the budget. Cuts have already put funds for HIV treatment and environmental projects in jeopardy.
Civic leaders including New Orleans City Council members JP Morrell and Helena Moreno spoke at the rally. Morrell compared the current state of the federal government to the Civil Rights era, citing the surveillance of activists.
“We are going to organize at our kitchen tables, at our bars, our restaurants, in the parks, like our forefathers did,” Morrell said during his speech. “That’s what’s necessary.”

Lisa Green, a resident of Bayou St. John, said she was worried about threats to public education. She drew connections to her mother’s advocacy for civil rights during the sixties and seventies. Green attended the rally despite unfounded warnings she saw on social media about martial law being enacted on protestors.
“I’m just trying to keep her legacy going and keep things straight and safe for my grandkids,” Green said. “If you’re fighting for something that you believe in, that’s just a chance you have to take.”
Attendees expressed their frustrations with the billionaire Musk’s control over the federal government. Metairie resident Whitt Conner came to the rally with his family and strung a handmade Cybertruck pinata to a tree. Conner said Trump’s policies have created a nation in which he and his family cannot survive, especially because members of his family are on Medicaid. After the speeches concluded, people flocked to the tree for a chance to hit the Cybertruck pinata.

Speeches emphasized community building, education and standing up to conservative agendas locally and nationally. Members of immigrant rights group Union Migrante implored elected officials to protect rights of undocumented migrants in the city and for the police to not collaborate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency that oversees deportations.
“If you’re a person with privilege, if you’re white and you have wealth and connections, it’s the moment to use that for good — to take the risk, to talk to your friend who’s a politician, to take to email, to stand up, to film ICE and tell them that this is shameful, what they’re doing,” Union Migrante member Edith Romero said. “We are taking a risk right now, being publicly, locally, fighting for our rights. If we can do it, you can do it.”
Union Migrante and other advocacy groups, like Step Up Louisiana and the Worker Justice Project, organized the New Orleans rally. Sue Mobley, a member of Indivisible NOLA, a progressive political advocacy group, was one of the organizers. Before the rally, she told Verite News that the peaceful protest would focus on calls to action, especially as voters express mounting frustration at the state of federal politics.
“Part of why it’s important to get people out in the street and get people involved in the long term, is to reduce that feeling of helplessness and give it somewhere to go,” Mobley said. “Not all of us are going to run for Congress tomorrow, but a lot more of us can show up at school board meetings and city council meetings and be engaged where we are most impacted.”
Samara Smith, an organizer at worker and racial justice group Step Up Louisiana called on elected officials to fight back.
“Our expectations from you, our elected officials, is that when they push the line, you push back harder,” Smith said in a speech. “When they toe the line, you pull it tighter and make it clear you’re willing to put your body and your career on the line to protect our liberties. Because I promise you, the ones you need to fear are not AIPAC, it’s not Shell and it’s not Lockheed Martin. It’s us, the people, and we will remember.”

The Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, is known for responding to extreme weather like hurricanes and wildfires — the kinds of disasters that are becoming more intense and common as climate change gets worse. But the agency also has a program that sends billions of dollars to communities, municipalities, and states proactively so that they can prepare for these events before they hit.
In an internal FEMA memorandum obtained and first reported by Grist, the Trump administration announced its plans to dismantle that program — the biggest climate adaptation initiative the federal government has ever funded — even as disasters incur hundreds of billions of dollars worth of damages across the United States. The decision comes as at least seven people were killed this week as tornadoes and catastrophic flooding descended on the central United States in what meteorologists called a once in a generation event.
The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, or BRIC, was established in 2018 during President Donald Trump’s first term, replacing a similar FEMA initiative. BRIC’s first round of funding was launched in 2020, when Trump was still in office, and in 2023, the program awarded close to a billion dollars to scores of communities, states, and tribal nations across the country. In January, before Trump began his second term, the agency opened its fiscal year 2024 notice of funding, with $750 million in matching grants made available to applicants from areas that received a major disaster declaration within the past seven years.
But FEMA now aims to cancel those grants and any other BRIC grants that have not been paid out yet by the federal government, according to the pre-decisional memo dated April 2 from Cameron Hamilton, a Trump administration official who is serving as FEMA administrator until the president appoints a permanent head of the agency.
“BRIC was yet another example of a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program,” a FEMA spokesperson told Grist. “It was more concerned with climate change than helping Americans effected by natural disasters.”
BRIC generally shoulders 75 percent of the cost of a given resilience project, and up to 90 percent of the cost of projects in disadvantaged communities. The program’s emphasis on equity is what may have marked it for demolition — the Trump administration has been systematically dismantling Biden-era efforts to infuse equity into governmental programs and direct more climate spending toward underrepresented groups.
FEMA employees disputed Hamilton’s argument in the memo that BRIC grants “have not enhanced the level of hazard mitigation as much as desired.”
“I don’t know where that came from,” said one agency employee who preferred to stay anonymous.
According to a source within the agency, the Trump administration asked BRIC staffers to offer justification for the program and its Direct Technical Assistance sister initiative, which offers non-financial support to help communities navigate the BRIC funding process and identify the hazards they face. The request was made on Tuesday this week with a Wednesday deadline.
With a tight turnaround, staffers offered success stories from across the country. BRIC awards have helped communities bury power lines, build culverts, protect wastewater facilities from being inundated by flooding, and upgrade power stations. If BRIC is frozen, communities will no longer be able to apply for the grants for fiscal year 2024 made available in January. Projects that have been selected in past years but not yet disbursed funds will no longer receive payment. Partially completed projects will be scrutinized and reviewed, the memo said.
“The administration now has one of FEMA’s most effective grant programs on the chopping block,” said Shana Udvardy, a senior climate resilience policy analyst with the Climate and Energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “It’s oversubscribed almost every single year.” In fiscal year 2023, FEMA received more than 1,200 subapplications across all 50 states, 35 tribes, five territories, and Washington, D.C., totaling more than $5.6 billion in requests. It was able to provide less than a fifth of the money requested.
A looming question is whether FEMA can yank grants that are being funded with money appropriated by Congress. The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the bipartisan infrastructure law, allocated approximately $6.8 billion to FEMA for community-wide mitigation efforts, with a portion of this funding directed to the BRIC program. “If this administration does away with the program, it goes against a law that Congress passed,” Udvardy said, “so there’s a concern there to be raised.”

(Library of Congress)Leavenworth is a city of prisons.
The area is home to five separate facilities, including a federal penitentiary, a state prison, and the U.S. military’s only maximum security prison. The imposing federal pen once housed Machine Gun Kelly and Robert Stroud, the “Birdman of Alcatraz,” who did most of his research on birds in Kansas, not on the California prison island.
In popular culture the city’s name has become synonymous with incarceration, a legacy of pulp magazines and old gangster movies. Prisons are among the city’s major employers, and construction is underway for a new $532 million federal prison to replace the existing 128-year-old facility by May 2026.
But there’s one detention facility that Leavenworth city officials don’t want.
It’s the newly (and Orwellian) named Midwest Regional Reception Center, a for-profit prison that would hold ICE detainees gathered in massive raids now undertaken by the Trump administration. The center would be located in the former Leavenworth Detention Facility, in operation from 1992 to 2021, which a federal judge once called “an absolute hell hole.”
Owned and managed by CoreCivic, formerly the Corrections Corporation of America, the nation’s largest private prison firm, the Leavenworth Detention Facility was a nightmare of humanitarian and civil rights abuses where both guards and inmates feared for their lives, according to court documents. Operated under a contract with the U.S. Marshals Service, in 2017 the Office of Inspector General issued a 129-page audit that found chronic understaffing and mismanagement.
Abuses continued even after the audit.
The American Civil Liberties Union and federal public defenders sent a letter to the White House documenting their concerns. Beatings and stabbings were rampant, suicides were prevalent, sexual assault reports were discouraged, and the company failed to report the death of an inmate for six days. Employees who were victims of crime were forbidden from being interviewed by police during work time, and CoreCivic staff refused to cooperate with city police on sexual assault allegations.
In 2019, a federal judge found that telephone conversations between detainees and their attorneys — conversations that should be confidential by law — were routinely recorded.
In 2021, a 39-year-old detainee, Scott W. Wilson, was beaten to death by another inmate who attacked him with a plastic food tray. The entire facility went on lockdown for weeks, with detainees kept in their cells except for showers every few days.
“The only way I could describe it, frankly, what’s going on at CoreCivic right now is it’s an absolute hell hole,” said U.S. District Judge Julie A. Robinson during a resentencing hearing four years ago. “The court is aware of it. The defense bar is aware of it. The prosecutors are aware of it. The United States Marshals are aware of it.”
The environment inside the facility was causing trauma to all involved.
“Guards have been almost killed,” she said. “Detainees are being traumatized with assaults and batteries, and not long ago a detainee was killed. So I’m well aware of the situation at CoreCivic and very troubled by it as well.”
After an executive order by former President Joe Biden prohibited the Justice Department from contracting with private prisons, the Leavenworth Detention Facility officially closed on Jan. 1, 2022.
But the story doesn’t end there.
Anticipating an opportunity to profit from the mass deportations, on Feb. 21 of this year CoreCivic applied for a special use permit from the city of Leavenworth to open a detention center for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The permit was necessary under city code because the facility had been closed for more than 24 months.
The application for “reactivation” of the detention center, which would operate as the “Midwest Regional Reception Center,” would allow approximately 1,000 detained noncitizens to be held on the 20-acre site.
“On average, detainees will be held for approximately 51 days as they are processed through the immigration system, including through removal hearings held at the facility,” CoreCivic said in document supporting the application. “All detainees who are processed through the facility will be transported to the nearest major transportation hub (i.e., the Kansas City International Airport) or the ICE office in Kansas City.”
CoreCivic, headquartered in Brentwood, Tennessee, would operate the detention facility through an interagency agreement with the Department of Homeland Security and ICE. The city had scheduled an initial public hearing before the planning commission hearing on the permit for April 7.
But on March 13, CoreCivic withdrew the application for the special use permit. It said it didn’t need one. On March 25, the prison corporation asserted that the recently awarded contract with ICE “necessitates a swift contract activation of the Midwest Regional Reception Center to accommodate their pressing need for capacity in the region,” according to court documents. There was no time to go through a lengthy permitting process. It began advertising for correction officers and other staff needed to reopen the facility.
On March 31, the city of Leavenworth filed suit in U.S. District Court to prevent CoreCivic from reopening the facility without a permit. The complaint asks for a temporary restraining order.
“The city is likely to suffer irreparable, irreversible, direct, and intangible harms to the health, safety, comfort, economic development, and property values of Leavenworth citizen and businesses” if CoreCivic is allowed to proceed, the city argued.
Supporting the suit was a declaration by Patrick Kitchens, Leavenworth chief of police, asserting that “significant problems” were encountered by the department when investigating violent felonies at the facility.
“Whether officers would be permitted to enter depended entirely on who was in charge,” Kitchens said. “Officers often were not allowed access at all and had to conduct interviews outside of the facility’s gate.”
CoreCivic prohibited its employees from giving interviews to police on company time, he said.
“Instead, these crime victims were forced to provide a written statement through the holes of the facility’s fence and then follow up on their own time,” he said.
The company also routinely refused to turn over evidence, including photographs and weapons that had been used in assaults among inmates and against guards.
I reached out to CoreCivic for a response to the city’s lawsuit.
“We don’t believe it’s right for Leavenworth’s taxpayers to have to pay for a lawsuit protesting efforts at the facility that would result in the creation of 300 jobs,” Ryan Gustin, senior director for public affairs, wrote in an email. “We’ve been part of this community as a dedicated employer for more than 30 years, and our intention remains to meet the emerging needs of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at our Midwest Regional Reception Center.”
Gustin said CoreCivic believes the site is already properly zoned. He did not address a question about allegations of past abuses at the facility.
Leavenworth has been a prison town for more than a century, and its city leaders and residents know that’s not an easy legacy. When I visited Leavenworth a few years ago, I heard from shopkeepers along its main street and the customers in a local diner that nearly everybody either had worked at one of the prisons or had a family member who did.
When I learned recently the city had filed suit to stop the reopening of the Leavenworth Detention Facility, my first thought was it seemed out of character for a prison town. But the more I thought about it, the less out of character it seemed. Who better to judge the civic threat posed by a for-profit prison company with a horrifying record of mismanagement and abuse?
It may also be part of the crisis of conscience the country is having about mass deportations. If the flights to a notorious El Salvadoran prison, in apparent defiance of a federal judge’s verbal order, don’t give you pause, consider this: the Trump administration has admitted that not everyone it deported on those planes was a criminal. An “oversight” resulted in the deportation of a Maryland man who had been granted protected status, but the U.S. government says it’s unable to retrieve Kilmar Abrego Garcia from the custody of El Salvador.
What the government of the United States did in our name was to effectively disappear a 29-year-old father. Whether he will emerge alive from his ordeal is uncertain.
Despite noncitizens having rights under the Constitution, hurried deportations are preventing detainees from accessing the courts. This obscene abuse of power is brought to bear not only on those who are suspected gang members, but is also being used to remove international students whose opinions the administration finds irksome.
There is a name for this, and it is terrorism.
Terrorism is defined in the U.S. Criminal Code is to engage in violent criminal acts that appear to be intended to “intimidate or coerce a civilian population.” What happened to Garcia and others was violent and illegal, and there is little doubt it was meant to intimidate and coerce others.
Today the deportees are those “suspected” of being gang members because of their tattoos and college students who have exercised their First Amendment rights with op-ed pieces about Gaza. Tomorrow it might be just about anybody the government finds troublesome or merely inconvenient.
Take a look at your own tattoos, your own posts on social media and your friends or family members. There is something or someone among them that authorities could use to punish you. Have a butterfly tattoo? Some sources identify them as gang symbols. Have a cousin who did time for drugs? You’re a suspect, too.
To make mass deportations more efficient, facilities such as the “Midwest Regional Reception Center” are needed. Organized repression at scale requires the ability to detain thousands while hearings — or flights to third-world oubliettes — are arranged. The manufacture of terror also requires the tacit approval of a majority of citizens. This last is perhaps easier than imagined, because as any criminal defense lawyer will tell you, there is a built-in bias among the American public that if you’re arrested for something, you must be guilty.
That bias can only be overcome with fact.
Here is a 29-year-old Maryland man who was removed by irrevocable error. There is a Columbia University student arrested only because he was a political activist. And in Kansas, a private prison firm seeks to profit by becoming part of America’s mass deportation machine.
The story of American prisons is told in the architecture of the institutions at Leavenworth, from the castle-like old federal penitentiary built in 1903 to the modular shape of the contemporary military barracks. But the building that housed the Leavenworth Detention Facility resembles nothing so much as a warehouse, a place to store the bodies and souls of noncitizens until they can be discarded.
The question of whether the former Leavenworth Detention Facility should be brought back online as part of the mass deportation pipeline goes beyond the legal issue of whether it can be done without a municipal permit. It’s a moral question of whether it should be done.
The answer will define us.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/service-pnp-ppmsca-31700-31777v.jpg,,,2025-04-06 04:58:03.049492

(Maryland Matters file photo)With the end of the legislative session looming at midnight Monday, the bills have been coming fast and furious for Maryland lawmakers in recent days — and the pace will only pick up when they return Monday. While they haven’t cleared all the hurdles, some bills are pretty clearly on their way to final approval.
PDAB expansion bill nearing finish line
A bill that would expand the authority of a state board that is working to lower certain prescription drug costs is ready for the governor’s consideration, after the Senate passed House Bill 424 on party lines Friday evening.
The Prescription Drug Affordability Board is currently tasked with finding ways to reduce the cost of prescription drugs on the state’s health plan, saving some taxpayer dollars in the process.
The bill would expand the board’s authority to set what are called upper-payment limits on prescription drugs in the commercial market. Doing so would limit how much drug purchasers could spend on certain medications, which supporters hope would result in savings for more Marylanders. The bill also increases the number of people who sit on the board’s stakeholder council.
“This is a big day for Marylanders who may struggle to pay for their prescription medicines,” Vincent DeMarco, president of the Maryland Health Care for All Coalition, said in a Friday statement. He has been a vocal supporter of the board’s efforts and the bill expanding the board’s authority.
“With this measure enacted, the board can expand its work and develop common sense solutions to bring down costs for average Marylanders,” he said in the statement.
The Senate’s 33-12 vote on the House bill sends the measure back to the House for review. If the House approves, the bill will head to the governor’s desk for his review and possible signature. House approval is expected, as the Senate version of the bill is in the same posture.
FAMLI delay ready for full Senate consideration
The Senate Finance Committee passed a bill – somewhat reluctantly – to delay the implementation of the state’s paid family leave act, a program that has been pushed off twice already.
The Family and Medical Leave Insurance (FAMLI) program is set to begin in July. But amid a $3 billion budget shortfall and rapid-fire policy decisions from the Trump administration, the Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) administration proposed delaying the start of the program by 18 months, with benefits going out in 2028.
House Bill 102 would impose the delay, but some lawmakers are not happy prolonging the start to the program, according to discussions in a Senate Finance Committee voting session Friday.
Sen. Dawn Gile (D-Anne Arundel County) said the delay is “disappointing,” though she understood that it may be a necessary move due to the state’s budget concerns.
Committee Vice Chair Antonio Hayes (D-Baltimore City) also had heartburn over delaying FAMLI program, which has been pushed off twice since the program was created in 2022.
“This is the third time it’s been delayed,” Hayes said. “It continues to concern me because we’ve put so much into it, but we are where we are.”
Hayes ultimately voted against the bill, along with Democratic Sens. Benjamin Kramer of Montgomery County and Clarence Lam of Anne Arundel and Howard counties.
“I want to see it come to fruition,” Lam said. “It’s important to get this stood up as quickly as possible … there are a lot of people who need that help who could be helped sooner.”
But Finance Committee Chair Pamela Beidle (D-Anne Arundel) said the delay is necessary. If the state keeps the current timeline, “this program is going to start and we’re not going to have anything set up for it because we don’t have computer programs and we don’t have people.”
The Finance Committee voted 8-3 for the delay. Republicans who largely oppose the FAMLI program voted to delay the program start date but said that they’d rather not see the program get started at all.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/annapolis-1.jpg,,,2025-04-06 04:00:13.281706

The local “Hands Off!” protests were part of about 1,400 demonstrations organized against President Donald Trump and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk. The two-hour Omaha rally along Dodge Street and South Happy Hollow Boulevard involved nearly 1,000 protesters, many of whom showed up with signs, chants and common goals.
Protest organizers said in a statement online that the mass mobilization was a “message to the world that we do not consent to the destruction of our government and our economy for the benefit of Trump and his billionaire allies.”
Behind the protests
The rallies targeted the Trump administration’s immigration policies and the Department of Government Efficiency’s approach to cutting and pausing spending on healthcare, services, jobs and access to personal data held by the government.
Two pro-democracy organizations, Like-Minded Friends and 50501 worked with local partisans and others to pull together the event. They assembled a lineup of local and state political figures to speak in Memorial Park.

The lineup included registered nonpartisan U.S. Senate candidate Dan Osborn, who reaffirmed that he is weighing a run against Pete Ricketts for Senate in 2026 and Omaha Mayoral Candidate John Ewing Jr, a Democrat running against incumbent Republican Mayor Jean Stothert on May 13.
Ewing, a former Maverick who also taught at UNO’s College of Public Affairs and Community Service, mentioned the importance of voting and civic engagement to “have the democracy that our forefathers imagined.”
“I think it’s always critically important that people take an active role in their government,” Ewing said. “When they don’t, then we end up with what we’re seeing across the country right now, with the chaos, the fear, the uncertainty, the hatred and everything that is diametrically opposed to what America is supposed to stand for.”
Douglas County Democratic Party Chair CJ King said the demonstration “was a show of force” to help people realize they can make a change locally and nationally.
“I think there’s a lot of people that just don’t like the direction we’re going in,” King said. “People need to come out and recognize that you can’t sit alone and be despondent and have anxiety and fear. We come together and we have hope and an opportunity.”
Republicans respond
Douglas County Republican Party Chairwoman Nancy Hicks, responding to the protests, acknowledged the concerns of the protesters but said she and the party support the actions of the federal government.

Hicks said she believes Medicare and Medicaid “lose billions annually to improper payments.” She questioned why citizens wouldn’t want government expenditures to be examined “to make sure they actually are functioning as designed.”
“The Douglas County Republican Party, aligning with Trump and Musk, agree that the focus is on preserving these programs by rooting out misuse, fraud and waste, not necessarily dismantling them,” Hicks said.
Along with congregating in Memorial Park, protesters lined both sides of Dodge Street and the overpass. The sound of car horns blared as drivers held fists and signs out their windows in support.
Some posters said, “Hands off our democracy.” Others said, “Stop the chaos.” Another said, “Elect a clown, elect a circus.” Many said they backed democracy.
Attendees speak
UNO student Calvin Snyder attended the protest with his family and expressed worry for his future education, mentioning the federal government’s focus on dismantling the federal Department of Education.

“It feels like people are finally realizing that they are not alone in this,” Snyder said. “They are angry, and they are feeling the brunt of these terrible policies and that they can do something about it. I think this is a moment of awakening in a lot of America.”
Creighton University theology professor Susan Calef voiced distress about “the loss of democracy” and the failure of the checks and balances system. Having attended previous demonstrations, she said the people “have got to come together.”
“When you watch the news on a daily basis, it’s grim and very distressing. So to be together with other people and mobilizing like this really helps,” Calef said.

Omaha citizen Jean Zinnen attended the protest with her 15-year-old granddaughter, holding up signs along Dodge Street. Zinnen said the importance of protesting was so her granddaughter’s voice could be “heard and respected.”
“I am here because democracy is at risk,” Zinnen said. “I have friends, so many friends in marginalized communities. I have a trans niece, gay family members, and this is just horrifying. My granddaughter is protesting for her future.”
Omaha citizen Dawn Marie Hart was one of the first protesters to arrive, bringing a banner and dangling it on the overpass. Hart said she was 64 and has “never felt so strong about anything in [her] life.”
“I think the power of the people speaks a lot,” Hart said. “It doesn’t matter if they’re Republican or Democrat or what[ever] they are. He made promises, and he didn’t keep them. Now we have to fight to get everything back.”

William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery) responds to questions Saturday on the bill that seeks to limit financial liability in child sex abuse lawsuits. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Lawmakers gave final approval Saturday to a bill designed to give survivors of childhood sexual abuse their day in court, while shielding Maryland from what could be billions of dollars in payouts for such claims.
The rapid-fire passage of House Bill 1378 — it got out of the House, through the Senate, back to the House and to the governor’s desk in just two days — followed two weeks of often emotional and sometimes personal debate about the bill.
The bill is a response to the Child Victims Act of 2023, which lifted the time limit during which people could file lawsuits against public or private institutions where they claimed they had been sexually abused as children. That bill was a victory for Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles), a child sexual abuse survivor himself who had spent years pushing for the measure.
But Wilson sponsored HB1378 this year after thousands of people lined up to file claims against the state and it became clear that damages could rise into the billions of dollars, potentially bankrupting the state. Many lawmakers who voted for the bill in recent days pointed to the need to protect the state while allowing survivors their day in court.
“On balance, I think this is the right way to go,” said Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery), chair of the Judicial Proceedings Committee that passed the bill Saturday morning. The full Senate passed it 36-7 just hours later.
Opponents were divided between those who said the Child Victims Act should never have been approved in the first place and those who said the bill to fix it was either unconstitutional or wrongly hurt victims — or both.
Senate, House approve Second Look Act in quick succession, send it to governor

“This is the most knowingly unconstitutional piece of legislation this legislative body has ever passed,” said Corey Stern, an attorney representing child sexual abuse survivors, in a text after Saturday’s full Senate vote. “The members who voted for it should be ashamed of themselves. The leadership that insisted they do should be voted out of office.”
The Child Victims Act capped awards against public institutions, like the state, to $890,000 per incident for an abused child. It set the cap for private institutions, like the Catholic Church or scouting organizations, at $1.5 million.
HB1378 would lower the cap for public institutions to $400,000 and for private institutions to $700,000 for cases filed June 1 or later, when the new law takes effect. Claims before that would be subject to the original rules. The bill would also cap fees for attorneys at 20% for cases that settle out of court and 25% for cases that result from a court judgment.
The bill also narrows the scope of the term “incident,” so that all crimes by one abuser against one victim would count as one incident, rather than one incident for every separate assault.
Del. Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore City), who spoke on behalf of Wilson during a Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee hearing on the bill Friday, said about 1,500 lawsuits have been filed since the Child Victims Act was passed, and another 4,000 cases are waiting to go forward.
Sen. Jack Bailey (R-Calvert and St. Mary’s) was one of seven Senate Republicans to vote against the bill Saturday. He also voted against the Child Victims Act two years ago.
“I did not feel it was appropriate that if the General Assembly allowed these current victims to receive compensation based on a decision we made, that now all of a sudden, we should change that,” Bailey said after Saturday’s vote.

Much of the Senate debate was between Smith and Minority Whip Justin Ready (R-Frederick and Carroll). Ready said it “was a mistake” for the legislature to pass the 2023 measure that lifted previous statutory time limits and allowed survivors to sue their abusers or organizations that harbored them “at any time.”
“Hindsight is always 20-20,” Smith said.
“But there was foresight. I think people didn’t want to say ‘no’ to the pressures. Not do something, but slow down,” Ready said.
After about 25 minutes of debate, the Senate give the bill preliminary approval before suspending the rules so that the bill could go to third reading, or given final approval, on the same day.
Before the final vote, Sen. Chris West (R-Baltimore County) said part of the legislation could face an immediate court challenge, especially over the limited definition of incident for victims. West summarized a recent Maryland Supreme Court decision when an incarcerated person in prison was assaulted twice “that occurred within minutes of each other.”
“The whole question that this bill sets up is whether our intent to now limit the cause of action to a single occurrence per claimant, whether that is constitutional,” said West, who voted for the bill. “This is going to be a lawsuit that will surely be filed almost immediately, and it will surely go right up to the Maryland Supreme Court.”
Because the Senate made a technical amendment to the bill, it had to go back the House for review. The House agreed to concur in the Senate amendment on a 92-40 vote, sending the bill to the governor.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sen.-William-C.-Smith-Jr.-4-5-2025-1024x770.jpg,,,2025-04-06 02:57:49.970845

“We face an epic struggle for democracy, for justice, for equality, for the very future of our country!” said Claire Richardson, one of the event organizers with the group ReSisters, to cheers from the crowd.
She read a long list of recent actions by the Trump Administration, and the crowd echoed, “Hands off!”

“We are here to tell Donald Trump and Elon Musk, hands off our democracy!” she said. “Hands off our children’s education. Hands off our jobs. Hands off our veterans. Hands off our bodies and gender choice. Hands off our elections, hands off Medicaid, hands off our libraries and museums. Hands off Social Security, hands off Greenland and hands off Canada!”
Many demonstrators carried Canadian flags, in a nod to support for Alaska’s closest neighbor and in protest of Trump threatening economic sanctions and even annexation of Canada. 
Alaskans joined demonstrations across the state, including Skagway, Haines, Gustavus, Petersburg, Sitka, Ketchikan, Kodiak, Soldotna, Wasilla, Healy, Dillingham, Bethel, Nome and large crowds in Anchorage and Fairbanks. 
The mood was high spirited, with the crowd singing together — some original songs by local artists — cheering, and waving signs. 
Speakers evoked the origins of the United States and the fight for independence from an oppressive monarchy, and condemned U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, and U.S. Rep. Nich Begich, R-Alaska, for allying with Trump, alleging they violated the Constitution and their oath of office.
“Have you no outrage at the detention and deportation of lawful residents?” said Juneau resident Tristan Knutson-Lombardo to the crowd, directed at Sullivan and Begich. “Have you no concern for Trump’s attempts to quell freedom of the press, defy judicial orders and seek retribution toward political opponents for supporting imperialistic land grabs?
“Shame on you for standing idle as our government whitewashes our history, represses scientific study, suppresses creative thought and erases the notion that anyone could identify as something other than the sex written on their birth certificate,” he said. “Shame on you!” 
Lauryn G̱úud Gíigangaa Framke, a Haida language teacher, made a powerful plea for action on behalf of youth and the next generation. “We are told that children are sacred, but that is only true until they are born poor, or until they are gay, or until they are trans or brown, or until it is time for them to go to school and the right to arms will always be more important than their lives,” she said. “But there is one thing we can have hope in, and that is community …. We can make sure that this community is a safe place for our children to grow up in. Because our youth are sacred, and they deserve better than this.” 
Ernestine Hayes, a former Alaska writer laureate and award-winning Tlingit author and professor, addressed the crowd and focused on the history of colonization being repeated. 
“They are taking our land. They’re telling us we have to speak English only. They want everyone to believe in their God. They’re removing our history and seizing our wealth. Does any of that sound familiar?” she said. “It’s still time to decolonize.” 
Mike Williams, a Juneau resident and small business owner, protested with a sign that towered over the crowd – on a 24-foot pole reading, “We’ve had it up to here.” He said he’s most concerned about the mass federal firings and cuts by the arm of the White House named DOGE, or “the Department of Government Efficiency,” coordinated by Elon Musk. 
“It just blows my mind that only 4% of our federal budget is on staffing. So to cut staff at all just makes little sense… I heard a really good metaphor. All of this is like cutting off your legs to try to lose weight,” he said. “Sure, you lost the weight, but at what cost? The outcome is much worse.”
He said the most difficult part is talking with close family members who continue to support Trump.  He said he’d like to see more people push back against “blind faith” in Trump and stand up against these kinds of actions of the Trump administration. 
“It’s okay to say that someone’s doing something wrong,” he said. “Like, we thought Biden has made a lot of mistakes. We thought Obama had some mistakes, and we can admit that. So, I just don’t understand why we can’t admit that about all this that’s going on too.”
Demonstrators and speakers noted the large crowd size for Juneau, with families with children, seniors and friend groups attending. Crowd size estimates exceeded 1,000, with organizers saying there were 1,550 based on photos taken from the fifth floor of the Capitol. More protests and demonstrations are expected, according to organizers.
Protests were planned for Saturday in more than 1,200 locations across all 50 states, as well as cities in Europe, including London, Berlin and Paris.

Cory Booker told Democrats in Paramus not to let their inability to do everything undermine their determination to do something.,"PARAMUS, NEW JERSEY - APRIL 5: U.S. Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) attends a Town Hall at Bergen Community College on April 5, 2025, in Paramus, New Jersey. Earlier in the week, Sen. Booker spoke on the Senate floor for over 25 hours, protesting President Trump’s agenda, breaking a record set by Sen. Strom Thurmond's 24-hour, 18-minute filibuster against the Civil Rights Act in 1957. (Photo by Kena Betancur/Getty Images)PARAMUS — Sen. Cory Booker urged a crowd of about 1,000 people at a town hall in this Bergen County town Saturday to speak up against the Trump administration, days after Booker won attention nationwide for a record-breaking, anti-Trump speech he delivered on the floor of the U.S. Senate.
Appearing at Bergen Community College on a day of nationwide protests against President Donald Trump, Booker spoke to people gathered in the school’s gym about funding threats to Medicaid, attacks on the LGBTQ community, and stronger leadership within the Democratic Party.
“One of the greatest lessons from history that I’ve learned … is that the only thing necessary for bad things that happen in any democracy is for good people to say nothing,” said Booker, a Democrat.
Audience members told the New Jersey Monitor that Booker’s Senate floor speech — which started Monday night and lasted for 25 hours and 5 minutes — was the first concrete action they had seen any Democrat take against the Trump administration, and they came to hear more from the senator.
“He just stood there and would not give up. That’s why I’m here today: to support him. He’s supporting America. We need more of that,” said Deborah Brown from Hackensack.
Saturday marked Booker’s first public event since the attention-grabbing speech, which surpassed a previous record when South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes in opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1957.
The town hall, and Booker’s speech, come as voters have pushed Democratic Party officials to take more action against plans by Trump and congressional Republicans to slash funding to social services, deport scores of undocumented immigrants, and implement tariffs that will push consumer prices skyward.
As Booker walked out to “I Won’t Back Down” by Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers, the crowd applauded and chanted “Cory, Cory, Cory.” Booker opened by saying that he’s heard from thousands of constituents telling him to help protect social services and the country’s democratic freedoms.
At one point, several protesters asked him to do more for Palestinians in Gaza. As law enforcement escorted them away, Booker said he respects their right to free speech but that he did not want others to be disrupted from sharing their stories.
He later said he wants more members of the public to stand up for their rights, encouraging them to “do a little bit more” by posting on social media or attending rallies.
“Find out what you can do. Do not let your inability to do everything undermine your determination to do something,” he said.

Courtnay Johnson-Suffern, president of the Bergen County NAACP, asked Booker what he would say to young people who feel disenfranchised and discouraged from running for office.
Booker responded by saying Democrats are unfairly accused of being “alarmists.”
“When our country is taking on the tactics of authoritarian leaders in authoritarian countries, when you see books being band from libraries across the country … those [are] tactics of authoritarian countries,” he said.
After the town hall, Booker spoke to reporters about what Democrats can do in this moment, as more young voters and voters of color express their disappointment in the party and in the political system at large.
“The party’s going to do great if they make the center of their focus the people and people struggling, people suffering right now,” he said.
He also said he recognized his party needs to take more action, but also highlighted the importance of convincing Republican politicians to vote against Trump’s policies.
“All of us have to be asking us right now, what can I do to help to appeal to the conscience of people who are many of them are in districts that are purple, districts that many of them — it’s clear that what Donald Trump is doing is wildly unpopular amongst their voters,” he said.

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)The House passed a potentially transformative package of energy reform bills Saturday that are aimed at hastening new power generation in Maryland and curtailing costs for ratepayers.
The move tees up the three-bill package, backed by General Assembly leadership, for final passage, even if it may come on the 90-day session’s final day.
The Senate, which previously approved the energy bills, is likely to concur with amendments made in the House, sending the bills to the governor’s desk, said Sen. Brian Feldman (D- Montgomery), chairman of the Education, Energy and the Environment Committee.
“We’ve been in pretty close consultation,” he said. “Unless there’s some surprise, I would anticipate that we’d be concurring.”
The legislation, which will spur in-state power generation, came as a response to escalating electric bills for Maryland consumers. In the run-up to the General Assembly session, new transmission line projects also stirred frustration from rural parts of the state, which will bring energy through Maryland from other states, spurred by coal plant retirements and increased power demand from data centers and other users.
Together, the bills would create uniform siting standards for solar arrays, replacing a patchwork of local policies, and set up a new state office focused on energy planning.
They would also establish expedited procedures for new power facilities in Maryland, potentially including nuclear and natural gas, as well as battery energy storage. In an effort to reduce costs for power customers, the bills would also limit certain utility spending and ratemaking practices, and hand out an electric bill rebate averaging $80 per household.
Lawmakers’ touted electric bill refund would average $81 per household

“We are an energy desert because the policies of the Maryland General Assembly do not like and do not promote anything but green energy, and green energy in the year 2025 cannot meet the needs of Maryland’s population,” said Del. Jason Buckel (R- Allegany), the chamber’s minority leader, on the House floor Saturday.
In response, Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D- Montgomery) took to the microphone to list off provisions in the bill she expects to save power customers money. Under the bill, Maryland’s utility regulator wouldn’t be able to approve multiyear rate plans, which can lock in successive rate increases over a period of several years, unless there is a benefit to customers. The bill also wouldn’t allow utilities to use a “reconciliation” process to recoup additional spending through rates.
The bill also places new limits on using ratepayer dollars to replace gas pipelines, requiring utilities to show a safety need. And it restricts other spending of ratepayer dollars, Charkoudian said, including on trade association memberships.
“These things, over the next years and decades, will save hundreds of millions of dollars for our ratepayers, and we should be proud to vote green for that,” Charkoudian said. “Oh, and as a bonus, ratepayers aren’t going to be paying for private jets for Exelon.”
The broadest bill (House Bill 1035 and Senate Bill 937), focused on utility regulation and power generation, has garnered pushback from environmental groups, who argue that natural gas plants would get a fast track, flying in the face of the state’s ambitious climate change goals and burdening nearby communities with air pollution.
The bill does require that any new natural gas plants approved by the Maryland Public Service Commission under the bill have the ability to convert to hydrogen or zero-emissions biofuel when “feasible.” It also requires the Commission approve renewable projects at a 4 to 1 ratio.
After Del. Brian Chisholm (R-Anne Arundel) slammed the legislature as “hostile to business” with excessive regulations, Del. Brian Crosby (D-St. Mary’s) pushed back.










It’s not an attack on a way of life. It is creating an opportunity for some of these farmers that simply do not wish to farm anymore.


– Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles), chair of the House Economic Matters Committee


“Much to the chagrin of some of the environmental groups, it promotes gas. There has not been, nor is there, a cap on gas in this bill. All it does is streamline a permitting process to cut down costs,” Crosby said.
The package’s bill focused on solar energy (House Bill 1036 and Senate Bill 931) also stirred considerable pushback from Republicans. The bill prevents local governments from adopting certain laws that block solar developments and sets statewide standards.
Solar farms are allowed to occupy up to 5% of any one county’s “priority preservation area,” which is agricultural land. After that ceiling is hit, counties can restrict solar on the remaining 95% of farmland.
Republican members of the House argued on Friday that the 5% cap was set too high. They argued that solar companies, bolstered financially by the government’s backing, could offer large sums to lease or buy farmland for massive solar arrays.
The associated loss of farm acreage could destroy the fabric of the Eastern Shore’s agriculture industry, said Del. Jefferson L. Ghrist (R- Upper Shore). And if acres of grain production are lost, the Shore’s poultry houses could be forced to import chicken feed, undermining their business as well, he said.
“This bill doesn’t explicitly hurt farmers. I want to make that crystal clear,” Ghrist said. “It does make an attempt to reduce the acreage to improve this, but the reason why I’m so adamantly against it, is because it just doesn’t go far enough. We could potentially lose up to 54,000 acres on the Eastern Shore front from grain production.”
Del. C.T. Wilson (D- Charles), chairman of the House Economic Matters Committee, which approved the energy bills, said that farmers should have the choice to bring solar onto their land, and shouldn’t be blocked by local governments. In turn, the panels will bolster the state’s energy generation goals, Wilson said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“It’s [the bill] not an attack on a way of life,” Wilson said. “It is creating an opportunity for some of these farmers that simply do not wish to farm anymore.”
But Ghrist argued that counties weren’t stepping out of bounds by restricting solar, but rather exerting their proper zoning authority.
“If somebody wants to put a nudie bar next to a church or a school, and the county says: ‘No, you can’t do that,’ I don’t think anybody in this chamber will say: ‘You know what? The county’s taking away their property rights,'” Ghrist said.
Del. April Miller (R-Frederick) pushed back against the funding mechanism for the package’s new “Strategic Energy Planning Office” (House Bill 1037 and Senate Bill 909).
“I still am struggling with setting up this office on the backs of ratepayers,” Miller said Saturday.
But Crosby said that all three of the energy bills, when taken together, are likely to yield ratepayer savings that go beyond the $5 million cost of setting up the planning office. And the data provided by the office will allow Maryland to be less reliant on the regional grid operator to answer its own queries.
“We think it’s money well spent,” Crosby said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC02846-brighter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-05 22:59:41.007276

Indivisible, one of more than 150 participating civil rights, labor, LGBTQ and other groups, put out a statement saying the rallies were an effort “to let Trump and Musk know they can’t intimidate us into submission.”
In Madison a massive crowd filled the lawns, sidewalks and streets on the State Street corner of the Wisconsin State Capitol, then marched the one-mile stretch to Library Mall on the University of Wisconsin campus. Organizers estimated more than 10,000 people participated.

Madison residents Jason and Aubrey, who declined to give their last names, said they were looking for a community with like-minded people. “We can be angry but it’s also fun to be out with people and it’s important to have joy in your life,” Aubrey said. She said she is concerned with rising income inequality and billionaires having control over social media and society.
“I’m scared for democracy and for the people I love who are going to be targeted by [Trump’s] immigration policies, his hatred of LGBTQ+ people. I felt kind of powerless and I think just being out here protesting, being in a really welcoming community — it’s what I can do right now,” Jason said. 
“Our next few years will be tough,” Charlene Bechen, a leader with the Oregon Wisconsin Area Progressives said. “MAGA leaders will launch attack after attack, perpetuate outrage after outrage, commit Injustice after Injustice with the goal of keeping us disoriented, demoralized and demobilized. We cannot allow that.”

A ‘Forward’ band played several songs in the time leading up to the official start of the rally at noon. One of the band members — seen holding the megaphone — told rallygoers that they were there to “express our outrage at our current political situation.” 
“We’ve got some songs for you. You know what helps sometimes when you’re scared and you’re angry — Dancing,” he said.

Jim from Mazomanie said his chainsaw with “Hand Off” written on it was getting a little heavy, but it was fun to bring some smiles to faces. He said it represented “Elon Musk and his idiocy,” and said that Musk has “worn out his welcome in Wisconsin.”
“If we didn’t produce Tuesday,” Jim said, referencing the state Supreme Court election, “[it] would be a whole different deal.” 
Luis Velasquez, an organizer for Voces de la Frontera, highlighted the attacks against immigrants by the Trump administration and the issue of local law enforcement being pushed to assist with efforts by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Velasquez told the crowd that he is a DACA recipient whose parents brought him to the U.S. as a child from El Salvador, but that no pathway to citizenship exists for him.

“I’m proud of being an immigrant myself and we know that there are plenty of good stories… stories that have been ignored and abandoned that have been systematically discarded,” Velasquez said. “Here in this space today, we can say that migration is beautiful, and that here is our home for the millions of immigrants who have been here in the U.S.” 
In Milwaukee, organizers estimated 5,000 people gathered in front of the Federal Building as police blocked the road. Democratic U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore told the crowd “I feel like I’ve been born again,” and compared the protest to the civil rights marches of the 1960s.  “We fought for voting rights back then. We fought for health care rights, then. We fought for the right for our elders to live in decency. We fought for educational opportunity. And guess what y’all, when we fought, we won. And that’s one of the things that… that’s the good news. Right now we’re fighting, and we are winning.”

The Trump administration, Moore told the crowd, is “actively trying to dismantle Medicaid.” Next week, as the Republicans move to push through their budget reconciliation bill with steep cuts to programs, they need to hear from the public, she said.  
Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of the immigrant workers’ rights group Voces de la Frontera, told the crowd, “This administration has made it clear from the beginning that they are taking a page from the fascist playbook, and treating immigrants as the scapegoat for the economic hardship that they are causing. They are trying to desensitize us to their cruelty, and to the humanity of others.”

Neumann-Ortiz talked about recent ICE arrests inside the Milwaukee County Courthouse, and called on county leaders to make the courthouse a safe zone from ICE arrests. “People will be afraid to come to the courthouse if that is not a protected zone,” she said. “And we know that these local fights are our frontline battles.” This is “where we have the most power” she added, saying it is imperative to win local struggles.
Calling out Trump administration detentions of political activists and deportations without due process to a notorious prison in El Salvador, Neumann Ortiz said,  “I know you’re as clear as I am that this is not just what they are doing to immigrants. They are paving a path, because that’s what they want to do to us.”
Cesar Hernandez of Voces spoke in support of unions and attacked Trump’s claim that undocumented immigrants are a drain on the U.S. economy. “In 2022 alone, undocumented folks contributed $2.2 trillion to our economy, not to mention paying $96.7 billion (with a ‘B’) in federal, state, and local taxes.”

Community activist Vaun Mayes told the crowd, “Right now food pantries for the poor and in need are losing funding in cities like this one right here, where food deserts are prominent.” Social Security and health care are being gutted, he said, “in front of our eyes.” He denounced the erasure of Black history in schools and the rise of white supremacist ideology. “Fight back we will. Defend one another we shall,” Mayes declared. “… ‘cause we are the true patriots. And we seek a new day and a place for all Americans in this nation to thrive.”

Weiser, a Democrat who is running for governor in 2026, told the crowd that the Trump administration “didn’t get the memo that immigrants make America great,” which is why he joined a lawsuit challenging Trump’s “unimaginable step of thinking a Sharpie could overrule the Constitution” when he issued an executive order to end birthright citizenship.
“In America, when we stand together, when we stand on our principles, we will always prevail,” Weiser said. “We cannot be silenced.”
Colorado has joined multiple lawsuits challenging actions of the Trump administration, many of which Weiser addressed at the rally. That includes a challenge to a Trump order banning gender-affirming care for anyone under age 19 and an order that halted distribution of federal funding and grants.
“What we need to recognize is the rule of law, the Constitution — they are in the balance,” Weiser said. “And I believe as we come through this, we will come through stronger, because we will better understand why we need to fight for our critical values, for equal protection of the laws, for freedom of speech, and yes, for due process of law.”

Luna Baez, daughter of Jeanette Vizguerra, a nationally known immigration rights activist who lives in Denver and has been in ICE custody since March 17, spoke at the rally seeking support for her mother. Baez said her mother was targeted because she consistently voices her support for immigrants, transgender rights and a ceasefire in Gaza, among other issues.
“I think we could all come to an agreement that the reason she was targeted was because she chooses to exercise her First Amendment rights,” Baez said. “I’m tired of seeing this sort of barrier where people think that everyone’s fight is exclusive and we can’t all come together toward the same thing, because we’re all under attack under the same people, under the same administration.”

Jim and Pam Cosgrove came to the rally from Littleton because they’re “fed up with the direction the country is going,” Jim said. Pam said the U.S. is meant to “help the underdog,” and instead government leaders are “pissing everybody off.” 
“If you’re not outraged by it, you’re not paying attention,” Jim said. He is retired after spending 38 years as a police officer in Denver, and said this was his first time at a protest on the side of the protesters. He walked around holding a large sign that said “orange lies matter.”
“I think it’s been generations since you’ve seen this kind of public involvement in politics,” Jim said. “Probably the Vietnam War was the last time I remember seeing consistent protests of this strength. It’s a very strong message that people are not happy.”

The rally in Denver was one of more than 1,000 Hands Off! events planned Saturday in all 50 states. Organizers hosted several other protests around Colorado in Boulder, Bailey, Greeley, Fraser, Telluride, Glenwood Springs, La Junta, Durango, Grand Junction, Summit County, Fort Collins, Loveland and Fairplay.
Morgan Miransky, a volunteer who helped organize the rally, said he’s been an activist for over 30 years and felt bringing people together for a rally is the most effective way to show elected officials when people are not happy. He said a group of about seven organizations worked together to plan the rally. 
“We were expecting a good turnout, but this is better than we thought it would be here,” Miransky said. “We’re looking forward to having more people come out and join us, and we’re hoping to build this into a larger nationwide movement for resistance.”

Jenett Tillotson, a longtime supporter of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who drew a crowd of over 10,000 people during an appearance in Denver in March, said she is “tired of billionaires running our country.” She said “we would be fine” if the government taxed billionaires. Billionaires are “hoarding money,” Tillotson said, and if they were hoarding anything else, “we would call them nuts.” She stood on the lawn in front of the Capitol building holding a large homemade sign that said “tax the rich.”
“People are suffering, and income equality is the biggest that we’ve ever seen, ever,” Tillotson said. “You’re talking about why people can’t afford healthcare, because they don’t make enough money to afford health care.” 
The high turnout at the rally tells elected officials that people are upset, Tillotson said. She said protests and rallies like Hands Off! will keep growing “until they listen to us.” 
“This is our country, the people’s country,” Tillotson said. “It’s not the billionaires’ country, it’s not Trump’s country.  It’s not even Democrats or Republicans’. It’s the people’s.”

LISTEN: Hear Northwest Arkansas residents share, in their own words, why they attended the rally and what concerns they have about Trump’s policies. 			



Storms that wreaked havoc on the state this week paused midday as Northwest Arkansas residents, ranging from children to retirees, lined both sides of College Avenue and received honks of support from drivers on the busy thoroughfare. Rallygoers held signs and chanted for about an hour and a half before marching to the Fayetteville Town Center on the downtown square. 
The We the People Veto Project 2025 event was a continuation of local grassroots efforts to organize in opposition to President Donald Trump’s policies. Erin Killeen said she and a few other concerned citizens came together after the inauguration seeking to build community by hosting protests that also highlight existing community organizations that can provide local residents with information about how to become more engaged.
Killeen said their events have aligned with the 50501 Movement in an effort to amplify efforts at the national level. The 50501 Movement presented Saturday’s national day of action in partnership with the Women’s March and Hands Off. 
“It’s a way to feel less alone, but more importantly, we also want to have information so that they can plug in in a more strategic, more structured way than just coming out and protesting, so that there can be that informed, lasting change that is really needed to shift and be part of the democratic process,” she said. 
To connect local residents to community organizations and upcoming events like protests, Killeen said she and her fellow organizers have created a new website that can be a resource for those looking to engage.
Having lived abroad, Killeen said she wasn’t shocked, but disappointed to see the recent political shift in the United States, and is calling on elected officials to do their duty of upholding the Constitution. 
“Hold the executive branch accountable. Do not allow for that executive overreach that is disempowering Congress,” she said. “That is dangerous for the future and the sovereignty of this nation, freedom of individuals and it goes against what the forefathers were trying to do.”

New Jersey U.S. Sen. Cory Booker energized 78-year-old Diane Manering this week with his record-breaking speech on the Senate floor. The Fayetteville resident said she’s been protesting since the 1960s, but “nothing has been this important” for her and her kids. 
“I really found myself getting very discouraged, and I saw a lot of my friends getting very upset — [the] older generation because of our grandkids — and I’ve always been very passionate about the environment,” Manering said. “But to see what this administration is doing, harming people and the cruelty, I’m just not a cruel person. I’m a kind person.”
What federal cuts could mean for Social Security was top of mind for Trudi Rust of Fayetteville. The retired health care worker said she relies on social security to pay her bills. 
“I earned this and they’re trying to take it away and slash it by somebody that’s not elected,” Rust said, referring to Elon Musk, a special adviser to the president. “…They’re hurting us all so that they can gain money and power, and it’s not right…I live on it. I pay my bills with it, and I earned every damn penny of it. I worked for over 50 years paying into Social Security.”
The Fayetteville protest coincided with more than 1,200 “Hands Off!” rallies planned for Saturday in Washington, D.C., state capitals and scores of other cities, according to The Associated Press via PBS.
Storms forced the rescheduling of a rally planned for the Arkansas Capitol steps in Little Rock until next Saturday, April 12, according to a Facebook post by Indivisible Little Rock and Central Arkansas. Rallies had also been planned for Fort Smith, Russellville, Monticello.
In Tennessee, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth spoke to about 800 people at Pearl Cohn Magnet School in Nashville, and about 1,500 rallied at Nashville’s Centennial Park despite the threat of storms, the Tennessee Lookout reported.
In South Dakota, thousands gathered in downtown Sioux Falls as part of the 50501 Movement’s rally, the South Dakota Searchlight reported.

(Julia Goldberg/Source NM)Amid brisk temperatures and steady snowfall Saturday afternoon, hundreds turned into thousands as protesters converged at the Roundhouse in Santa Fe, one of a dozen protests planned in New Mexico as part of a nationwide “Hands Off” movement in opposition to the Trump administration.
In Santa Fe, attendees sang parodies of folk songs (“Hey, Mr. Tangerine Man); chanted (Hey/hey/ho/ho fascists presidents have to go); and cheered on speakers such as U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, a Democrat representing New Mexico’s 3rd Congressional District.
“Hands off everything we love,” Leger Fernández said, pointing at the myriad signs in the crowd. “Hands off our democracy. Hands off trans-life, hands off our union, hands off our youth, hands off our fireman, hands off our women’s health, hands off immigration, hands off elections, hands off diversity. We want our country back!”
Leger Fernández told Source the message she came to give is “indeed we are in a moral moment, and everybody here today is rising to the occasion and is showing that this is love in action: When we show up, when we stand up, when we’re in the streets, on the feet, at the town halls, making calls, at the ballot box, in the courtroom, in the classroom, standing up for what is right and standing against the Musk/ Trump extreme Republicans agenda that’s hurting everything we love.”
Leger Fernández noted some small signs victories in Congress, such as a Democratic-backed Senate resolution bucking the president’s Canadian tariffs, supported by four Republicans, and House Republicans’ recent failure to use a procedural move to block a resolution, in which nine Republicans bucked their party leadership.
“It’s a small victory,” Leger Fernández told Source, “but it shows that when we can get just a few Republicans to vote with us, we can defeat the Trump agenda. That’s why we’re holding town halls, we’re showing up at places like this. We’re holding town halls in Republican districts because we just need three Republicans to have the courage to stand with their constituents and with the Constitution and not with Trump. This kind of mass movement puts pressure on the Republicans.”

In Nashville on Saturday U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren criticized President Donald Trump’s and billionaire ally Elon Musk’s economic policies, saying they are handing the country over to billionaires at the expense of Americans’ personal finances. 
“Seventy three million Americans get Social Security checks. It is not charity,” said Warren. “Elon Musk’s plan is to fire the people who get those Social Security checks out so that fewer people are able to get their Social Security checks.”
“Does firing half the people at the Social Security agency put money in your pockets?” Warren asked. 
About 800 people attended the event, billed as “The People’s Town Hall,” held at Pearl Cohn Magnet School. The event was part of a national Democratic initiative to make inclusions into Republican-dominated states in which federal lawmakers are holding few, if any, public meetings. 
Warren specifically addressed cuts to veterans programs and public education. 
“Public schools are the investment in our future,” Warren said. “They give millions of kids in America – all of our kids – an opportunity to grow, to learn, to live independently, an opportunity to support themselves, an opportunity to contribute to this country.”

Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell spoke to the crowd before Warren took the stage, as did state Sen. Charlane Oliver, a Nashville Democrat who represents the district in which the event was held. 
Oliver referenced anti-immigrant bills moving through the Tennessee legislature, including one that would challenge Plyler v. Doe, the 1982 Supreme Court ruling that states cannot deny public education to children without permanent legal status. 
“We are fighting for a nation of the future that includes all of us,” Oliver said. 
State Democratic lawmakers attending the Nashville event included, in addition to Oliver, Sen. Jeff Yarbro, Reps. Shaundelle Brooks, Yusuf Hakeem, Gloria Johnson, Justin Jones, Bo Mitchell and Gabby Salinas. 
“It’s rare to have a leader with a mind like mine here in Tennessee,” said Sharon Dean of Nashville, of her attendance at the Warren event.
Thousands of Tennesseans turned across the state — including in Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville and Chattanooga — to protest Trump’s and Musk’s sweeping cuts to federal agencies through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE.) 
Threat of severe weather didn’t deter the approximately 1,500 rallygoers at Nashville’s Centennial Park, despite confusion after event organizers cancelled the protest Saturday morning because of weather concerns.
The “Hands Off!” rallies like the ones in Tennessee were held nationwide Saturday. Indivisible, a nonprofit group founded after Trump’s first election in 2016, was one of the primary organizers of the event. 
“The Tennessee Republican Party wants to send our prayers to all the Tennessee families that have experienced loss of both life and property since this significant weather event that has impacted most of our State over the last four days.  Yet, while most Tennesseans were dealing with the aftermath of the storms and flooding, the Democrat Party chose today to continue their election complaints against President Trump which the American people rejected at the ballot box a little over 4 months ago,” said Tennessee Republican Party Chair Scott Golden in a statement.
“Political dissent, without violence, is enshrined in the 1st amendment of the U.S. Constitution and Tennessee Democrats are welcomed to continue to rehash the issues of 2024 which led to the landslide victories for President Trump and the Republican Party. Anytime Senator Warren and her brand of liberalism comes to Tennessee it improves our chances for victory in 2026,” Golden’s statement said.

The rally was organized by Women’s March Minnesota, the MN 50501 group and Indivisible Twin Cities. An estimated 1,300 “Hands Off” rallies were held in all 50 states Saturday.

The demonstration drew veterans groups, LGBTQ organizations, teachers, rank-and-file union members, federal employees, advocates for immigrants and thousands more outraged at Trump’s legally dubious dismantling of the federal government; steep tariffs on allies and tiny countries alike; musings about displacing the entire population of Gaza; abandonment of Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression; threats to annex Canada and Greenland; attempted erasure of Black history; and cancellation of important environmental programs and protections. 
The timing of the rally was fortuitous, coming the day after a steep drop in the stock market after Trump announced tariffs, raising fears of a worldwide trade war and recession.

In Billings, residents from Yellowstone and surrounding counties held signs and lined all sides of the North 27th Street corridor for several blocks as they participated in the “Hands off our Democracy” rally.
They protested the President Donald Trump administration, tariffs, and Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, as did rally-goers throughout the state and country, and thousands at the National Mall in Washington, D.C.
Rev. Angie Dornisch, the pastor at Hope United Methodist Church in Billings, spoke about the similarities of the political climate and the Easter season as protestors “high-fived” cars that slowed to give encouragement or show solidarity.
Some waved flags from the windows.
“The followers of Jesus must care for the foreigners and immigrants because Jesus was a foreigner in a different land,” Dornisch said. “Even in our tombs of despair and destruction, I have a message: Hope and love is alive. Darkness can be overwhelming, but it will not win. Resurrection is coming.”
Other mental health advocates urged people to find strength in each other, and to attend to personal mental health, especially when the news can be upsetting or confusing.
Union members said that the American promise was under attack, and urged solidarity and resistance.
“The American promise is if you work hard and play by the rules, you can live a decent life — we have to make that promise work,” said AFL-CIO member Bob Struckman. “Trump and his minions are breaking that promise, and we’re keeping it with the tools that we have in our democracy.”
Many of the speakers said that residents must continue to gather to support democracy, object to policies they don’t like, use the First Amendment to speak out, as well as use the power of the ballot.
“We live in the richest nation on earth, at the richest time in our history, so why are we so broke?” Struckman said.

Lance Edward, the president of the Billings Education Association, which represents 1,200 teachers in the Billings Public Schools, is an English teacher and a football coach.
“The great strength in our nation is our diversity. I am not sure we can say that word anymore,” he said. “So I will yell it.”
Donna Veraldi of the Billings chapter of the League of Women Voters said their organization is concerned about the efforts to change the access to the ballot.
“When we take rights away from others, we lose those same rights for ourselves,” she said. “If ever there were a time to fight, it is now. Knowing how to fight does not mean we know how to win. Knowing how to fight is about knowing how to lose and still fighting.”
Kris Glenn of the Yellowstone Valley Citizens Council used a historical example from the Billings area to rally the crowd.
She spoke of when Billings, home to three large oil refineries, had among the worst air quality in the nation, until citizens stepped up to demand a change.
“Real change didn’t come from the top down, it came from the bottom up. That’s us, today,” she said.
She said she was concerned that a $1 million grant to Billings to plant more trees to help reduce climate change was at risk for being cut by the Trump administration.
“Hands off our communities, and hands off our future. Our elected leaders work for us, but only if we speak up,” Glenn said.



















































































































































































































































































































Gerald Kessler, a retired government teacher at Billings Senior High, said that his thoughts were with one person who wasn’t at the rally, his father.
“Eighty years ago, he was a medic in the U.S. Army. He was neither a sucker or a loser. He saw thousands of dead men. He would be appalled by what’s happening today because he fought against fascism,” he said.
Elizabeth Klarich, one of the co-leaders of Yellowstone Indivisible which organized the event, as well as a large rally last month in Billings, said that crowd represented a diverse background of every living generation, and an array of concerns.

“It’s not right or left here, but it’s right versus wrong, and we’re here to stand up,” she said.
In Missoula, the drumming at the demonstration reverberated at least a block and a half away from the Missoula County Courthouse, where by a couple of estimates, roughly 3,000 people gathered to protest Trump’s agenda — and point to different political priorities.
Mark Sanz of Missoula held a sign that said “Nobody Voted For Social INSecurity.”
He said the idea for the sign came from a friend who contributed to the program all her life and fears it’s now in jeopardy.
“They’ll start decreasing Society Security in the name of tax cuts for the rich,” Sanz said. “Same with Medicaid. That’s what’s coming.”
Dogs wore sandwich boards that said, “Dogs Against DOGE,” and people blew bubbles that floated into the sky, and they chanted, “Good trouble,” and “Hands off.”
The crowd also chanted for Sen. Bernie Sanders. The independent from Vermont and former Democratic presidential candidate has been on a “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, and the crowd chanted, “Bernie, Bernie, Bernie” at the news he will be in Missoula on April 16.
The rally kicked off with the crowd singing, “This Land Is Your Land,” and emcee Jim Sayer asked people to fist bump each other as a reminder of connection.
“We all are together in this. We all have to look out for each other,” Sayer said.
The Montana Legislature is in session in Helena, and some lawmakers are anticipating the possible need for a special session to address potential federal cuts that affect the state budget — including those who welcome a leaner budget.
  People of all ages participated in the “Hands off Our Democracy” rally at the Yellowstone County Courthouse lawn in Billings, Montana on April 5, 2025 (Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montanan).
Already, Montana has seen effects of the federal cuts, from the announcement this week that Humanities Montana had lost its entire federal grant that supports programs in all 56 counties to earlier cuts of U.S. Forest Service workers.
On the courthouse lawn, one sign decorated with pine trees read, “Resistance Ranger! Protect Our Public Lands!!!” Another read, “Save America! Deport Musk,” and one said, “IKEA assembles better cabinets.”
The gathering at the courthouse was the largest at least in recent years, organized by Missoula Resists, Indivisible Missoula, and Stand Up, Fight Back. Speakers talked about the importance of Indigenous rights, health care, the planet, arts and reproductive rights.
“We are not willing to be overwhelmed or torn apart,” said Rose, with Missoula Resists (Rose declined to share her last name through an organizer). “I think we might be more (unwilling) now.”
Meredith Printz, with Indivisible Missoula, said the group is new, and it believes the Congressional delegation is failing to represent Montanans on Social Security, education, and the dismantling of government agencies by Musk.
As the demonstrators cheered for change and booed Trump and Musk, drivers honked as they rolled past the courthouse, and people in the crowd snapped pictures of each other and commented on the turnout.
“What an amazing day,” said one woman at the tail end of the gathering.
When Sayer said Trump had taken office just 76 days ago, the crowd booed, and Sayer said he had to remind them anyway.
He likened Trump’s approach in office to a “demolition derby,” and he told people it is a dark time in America, but it’s also springtime, and he read a quote from Alice Walker.
“As long as the earth can make a spring every year, I can,” Sayer said.

That was what U.S. Sen. Angus King told the thousands of people who gathered on Congress Street in Portland on Saturday to protest the administration of President Donald Trump.
According to organizers, 3,000 people attended the Portland rally, which was just one of more than 20 events held across Maine as part of national “Hands Off!” actions to demonstrate widespread opposition to the gutting of the federal government spearheaded by billionaire advisor Elon Musk.
The town mall in Brunswick, where over 500 people rallied, was a sea of homemade signs. Maine Senate President Mattie Daughtry, who represents the district, was among the crowd and noted it was one of the few times in her life she’s seen “this many people gathered for something like this.”
The message, she said, is “to listen to the people.”
“A lot of the signs that I saw were about ‘Hands off our Social Security,’ ‘Hands off our libraries,’ ‘Hands off our health care,’ I think what we’re saying is, you can’t completely unravel the fabric of our society without people noticing.”

Outside the Maine State House, another one thousand people gathered. 
One attendee, Angela, who only shared her first name, said she’d never been to a protest before but felt compelled to join because she’s concerned for her kids’ future. 
“This really impacts me a lot,” she said of the Trump administration. “This changed the narrative for me, for their future.”
Angela, who made a sign featuring Dr. Seuss’ Lorax, said she grew up visiting state and national parks. “I want to bring my kids to the parks, but the parks are going to close if there is no one there to staff it.”
She continued, “We don’t have enough trees as it is. They give us clean air, that’s how we get our clean air. And they want to take them all away.”
The demonstrations in Maine were organized by local grassroots groups and individuals, though the national day of action was spearheaded by a large coalition of unions and progressive organizations including 50501, AFL-CIO, Americans for Tax Fairness, Color of Change, Common Cause, Indivisible, League of Conservation Voters, League of Women Voters, MoveOn, Our Revolution, Patriotic Millionaires, SEIU, Third Act, Women’s March, and others.

“My angst is really about the millions of people who are hurting and will hurt because of his policies,” said Roni Wegner, with Indivisible 605, which helped organize the protest. “I don’t see how it’s going to help. There is no long-term plan.”

Another attendee, Reed Boysen, said, “This is not a left or right moment, this is a right or wrong moment.”
There were also protests in Pierre and Rapid City. The South Dakota chapter of the national 50501 Movement (50 protests, 50 states, one movement) was an organizer, saying that the protests were staged to “resist executive overreach, defend democracy, and oppose the harmful policies of Project 2025.” Conservative political groups wrote and published the Project 2025 plan as a roadmap to remake the federal government during Trump’s presidency.
The 50501 movement called on South Dakotans to “remove corrupt politicians from office,” “reverse the damage inflicted” and “reclaim our rights, our government and our future.”
Since Trump took office, he has moved rapidly with billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency to fire hundreds of thousands of federal workers, cut or freeze billions in federal government spending, eliminate the federal Department of Education and take other actions that drew protesters into the streets Saturday.

The gathering drew more than 500 people. (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)More than 500 people descended on the steps of the Alabama State Capitol Saturday to protest the actions and policies of President Donald.
The “Hands Off” protest Saturday in Montgomery was one of six others planned in the state and more than 500 throughout the country in opposition to the administration’s wide-ranging attacks on federal agencies and departments, attempts to deport immigrants and efforts to roll back LGBTQ+ rights, particularly for transgender Americans.
“Freedom is at stake, our constitution and our rights, the right to just exist,” said Annie Pearl Avery, a civil rights activist, in an interview following the event. “And we have a criminal and a crooked man in the White House. And his intention is to turn us back 150 years.”
Attendees sitting and standing on the steps of the Capitol held signs disparaging Trump and billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency, which has thrown thousands of federal employees out of work. Others hoisted “Hands Off posters that pertained to Social Security, education and the economy in keeping with the theme of the event.
“Today, we are standing because we have issues of every kind,” said civil rights advocate Wanda Battle to the crowd. “Look around this place, we have every set of issues that can be imagined. Today, we are telling the Trump administration–hands off.”
Since taking office in January, Trump has issued several executive orders to dramatically reshape the operations of the federal agencies and alter public policy. Speakers focused on the administration’s attempted deportations of immigrants. Trump is attempting to use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport immigrants from Venezuela to a prison in El Salvador, claiming they were a threat to public safety because they belonged to a gang.
“The story is that these were undocumented Venezuelan men who were part of a criminal gang,” said Lynn Hopkins, a minister at the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Montgomery, in a speech to the crowd. “It didn’t take long to find out, and it surprised none of us, that they were not all gang members, they were not all undocumented, they were not all Venezuelan and, for God’s sake, they were not even all men.”
The crowd also criticized Trump’s efforts to abolish the U.S. Department of Education. In early March, the agency announced that it was reducing its workforce by about 1,300, going from 4,100 to almost 2,200 employees.
“We have a lot of rural communities who are impacted,” said Mary Gannon, who attended the protest in Montgomery while visiting from New Hampshire. “We have a lot of kids who are living in poverty, a lot of kids who are dealing with food insecurity. For me, right now, defunding the Department of Education is really a concern, but it is all connected.”
Trump and Musk also drew the ire of the crowd with their attempts to downsize the federal labor force in what they claim are attempts to streamline government. They expressed concerns about funding reductions to meet their basic needs, from Medicaid to Social Security.
Attendees also criticized attacks on marginalized populations.
“I have transgender kids and adults in my church who are terrified right now, who feel they are being made scapegoats, and are worried about getting the health care they need, and are looking to move because they find their government attacking them day after day with new ways to make them a target,” said Shane Isner, a senior minister at First Christian Church in Montgomery.

(Jason Kempin/Getty Images)The nation’s historically Black colleges and universities, known as HBCUs, are wondering how to survive in an uncertain and contentious educational climate as the Trump administration downsizes the scope and purpose of the U.S. Department of Education — while cutting away at federal funding for higher education.
In January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order pausing federal grants and loans, alarming HBCUs, where most students rely on Pell Grants or federal aid. The order was later rescinded, but ongoing cuts leave key support systems in political limbo, said Denise Smith, deputy director of higher education policy and a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a left-leaning think tank.
Leaders worry about Trump’s rollback of the Justice40 Initiative, a climate change program that relied on HBCUs to tackle environmental justice issues, she said. And there’s uncertainty around programs such as federal work-study and TRIO, which provides college access services to disadvantaged students.
“People are being mum because we’re starting to see a chilling effect,” Smith said. “There’s real fear that resources could be lost at any moment — even the ones schools already know they need to survive.”

Most students at HBCUs rely on Pell Grants or other federal aid, and a fifth of Black college graduates matriculate from HBCUs. Other minority-serving institutions, known as MSIs, that focus on Hispanic and American Indian populations also heavily depend on federal aid.
“It’s still unclear what these cuts will mean for HBCUs and MSIs, even though they’re supposedly protected,” Smith said.
States may be unlikely to make up any potential federal funding cuts to their public HBCUs. And the schools already have been underfunded by states compared with predominantly white schools.










There’s real fear that resources could be lost at any moment — even the ones schools already know they need to survive.


– Denise Smith, The Century Foundation


Congress created public, land-grant universities under the Morrill Act of 1862 to serve the country’s agricultural and industrial industries, providing 10 million acres taken from tribes and offering it for public universities such as Auburn and the University of Georgia. But Black students were excluded.
The 1890 Morrill Act required states to either integrate or establish separate land-grant institutions for Black students — leading to the creation of many HBCUs. These schools have since faced chronic underfunding compared with their majority-white counterparts.
‘None of them are equitable’
In 2020, the average endowment of white land-grant universities was $1.9 billion, compared with just $34 million for HBCUs, according to Forbes.
There are other HBCUs that don’t stem from the 1890 law, including well-known private schools such as Fisk University, Howard University, Morehouse College and Spelman College. But more than three-fourths of HBCU students attend public universities, meaning state lawmakers play a significant role in their funding and oversight.
Marybeth Gasman, an endowed chair in education and a distinguished professor at Rutgers University, isn’t impressed by what states have done for HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions so far. She said she isn’t sure there is a state model that can bridge the massive funding inequities for these institutions, even in states better known for their support.
“I don’t think North Carolina or Maryland have done a particularly good job at the state level. Nor have any of the other states. Students at HBCUs are funded at roughly 50-60% of what students at [predominately white institutions] are funded. That’s not right,” said Gasman.
“Most of the bipartisan support has come from the U.S. Congress and is the result of important work by HBCUs and affiliated organizations. I don’t know of a state model that works well, as none of them are equitable.”

Under federal law, states that accept federal land-grant funding are required to match every dollar with state funds.
But in 2023, the Biden administration sent letters to 16 governors warning them that their public Black land-grant institutions had been underfunded by more than $12 billion over three decades.
Tennessee State University alone had a $2.1 billion gap with the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
At a February meeting hosted by the Tennessee Black Caucus of State Legislators, Tennessee State interim President Dwayne Tucker said the school is focused on asking lawmakers this year for money to keep the school running.
Otherwise, Tucker said at the time, the institution could run out of cash around April or May.
“That’s real money. That’s the money we should work on,” Tucker said, according to a video of the forum.
In some states, lawsuits to recoup long-standing underfunding have been one course of action.
In Maryland, a landmark $577 million legal settlement was reached in 2021 to address decades of underfunding at four public HBCUs.
In Georgia, three HBCU students sued the state in 2023 for underfunding of three HBCUs.
In Tennessee, a recent state report found Tennessee State University has been shortchanged roughly $150 million to $544 million over the past 100 years.
But Tucker said he thinks filing a lawsuit doesn’t make much sense for Tennessee State.
“There’s no account payable set up with the state of Tennessee to pay us $2.1 billion,” Tucker said at the February forum. “And if we want to make a conclusion about whether [that money] is real or not … you’re going to have to sue the state of Tennessee, and I don’t think that makes a whole lot of sense.”
Economic anchors
There are 102 HBCUs across 19 states, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands, though a large number of HBCUs are concentrated in the South.
Alabama has the most, with 14, and Pennsylvania has the farthest north HBCU.

Beyond education, HBCUs contribute roughly $15 billion annually to their local economies, generate more than 134,000 jobs and create $46.8 billion in career earnings, proving themselves to be economic anchors in under-resourced regions.
Homecoming events at HBCUs significantly bolster local economies, local studies show. North Carolina Central University’s homecoming contributes approximately $2.5 million to Durham’s economy annually.
Similarly, Hampton University’s 2024 homecoming was projected to inject around $3 million into the City of Hampton and the coastal Virginia region, spurred by increased visitor spending and retail sales. In Tallahassee, Florida A&M University’s 2024 homecoming week in October generated about $5.1 million from Sunday to Thursday.
Their significance is especially pronounced in Southern states — such as North Carolina, where HBCUs account for just 16% of four-year schools but serve 45% of the state’s Black undergraduate population.
Smith has been encouraged by what she’s seen in states such as Maryland, North Carolina and Tennessee, which have a combined 20 HBCUs among them. Lawmakers have taken piecemeal steps to expand support for HBCUs through policy and funding, she noted.
Tennessee became the first state in 2018 to appoint a full-time statewide higher education official dedicated to HBCU success for institutions such as Fisk and Tennessee State. Meanwhile, North Carolina launched a bipartisan, bicameral HBCU Caucus in 2023 to advocate for its 10 HBCUs, known as the NC10, and spotlight their $1.7 billion annual economic impact.
“We created a bipartisan HBCU caucus because we needed people in both parties to understand these institutions’ importance. If you represent a district with an HBCU, you should be connected to it,” said North Carolina Democratic Sen. Gladys Robinson, an alum of private HBCU Bennett College and state HBCU North Carolina A&T State University.
“It took constant education — getting folks to come and see, talk about what was going on,” she recalled. “It’s like beating the drum constantly until you finally hear the beat.”

For Robinson, advocacy for HBCUs can be a tough task, especially when fellow lawmakers aren’t aware of the stories of these institutions. North Carolina A&T was among the 1890 land-grant universities historically undermatched in federal agricultural and extension funding.
The NC Promise Tuition Plan, launched in 2018, reduced in-state tuition to $500 per semester and out-of-state tuition to $2,500 per semester at a handful of schools that now include HBCUs Elizabeth City State University and Fayetteville State University; Western Carolina University, a Hispanic-serving institution; and UNC at Pembroke, founded in 1887 to serve American Indians.
Through conversations on the floor of the General Assembly, and with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, Robinson advocated to ensure Elizabeth City State — a struggling HBCU — was included, which helped revive enrollment and public investment.
“I’m hopeful because we’ve been here before,” Robinson said in an interview.
“These institutions were built out of churches and land by people who had nothing, just so we could be educated,” Robinson said. “We have people in powerful positions across the country. We have to use our strength and our voices. Alumni must step up.
“It’s tough, but not undoable.”
Meanwhile, other states are working to recognize certain colleges that offer significant support to Black college students. California last year passed a law creating a Black-serving Institution designation, the first such title in the country. Schools must have programs focused on Black achievement, retention and graduation rates, along with a five-year plan to improve them. Sacramento State is among the first receiving the designation.
And this session, California state Assemblymember Mike Gipson, a Democrat, introduced legislation that proposes a $75 million grant program to support Black and underserved students over five years through the Designation of California Black-Serving Institutions Grant Program. The bill was most recently referred to the Assembly’s appropriations committee.

Denise Baum was ecstatic following a 63-35 House vote on Saturday morning to move HB 848, creating the Big Sky Rail account, over to the Senate.
The Billings Democrat is carrying a bill that would, if passed, give a state appropriation to the Big Sky Passenger Rail Authority for the first time. The authority would receive $2 million annually until a sunset date on June 30, 2031.
“I’m extremely excited,” Baum said Saturday morning. “This is such a truly momentous piece of legislation, building out infrastructure and just having people understand that the infrastructure is already there.”
If passed, the bill would support planning, outreach and organizational work. It would also help local governments apply for larger grants and help the Big Sky Passenger Rail Authority decide which places passenger rail would stop at.
The money is not going toward large capital projects or building new railroads. 
The bill got support in the Energy, Technology and Federal Relations Committee hearing from the Montana Economic Developers Association, the Missoula Chamber of Commerce, the AFL-CIO and various local elected officials from across the state.
It also had some bipartisan support on the House floor. Rep. Ed Byrne, R-Bigfork, and Rep. Katie Zolnikov, R-Billings both urged a pass on the legislation on the floor.
“When you have issues such as this that are so extremely impactful to Montanans across the state … political party lines blur,” Baum said.
The fiscal impact led to some opposition. Rep. Neil Duram, R-Eureka, and Rep. Tom Millett, R-Marion, both spoke against the legislation, with Millett bemoaning the Legislature for spending money “like a drunken sailor.”
Two routes through Montana were selected as “preferred routes” in the Amtrak Daily Long-Distance Service Study. It was a federal nod from the Federal Railroad Administration that the routes were viable.
Much of the rail lines are already in use for freight cargo, and proponents of the bill have said repeatedly passenger rail and freight can coexist. 
The money comes from a railroad tax fund, which has been looked at as a funding source for several bills this session. House Bill 103, brought by Rep. Zolnikov, would have created funding for railroad inspections and was looking to use funding from the railroad tax fund. The bill was tabled in committee and Baum said it “unfortunately” went down.
The Legislative Services Division released a letter on that bill, which included an estimate of railroad tax revenue — about $4 million per year. The money previously went to the general fund.
An amendment to House Bill 2 added some money for train inspections back into the budget.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/UP-tour-Nebraska-DBleizeffer.jpg,,,2025-04-05 14:08:04.867252
,Washington State Standard,2025-04-05 16:20:44+00:00,Washington State Standard,Emails show coordination between deputies in Idaho’s Kootenai County and immigration officials,"Rachel Spacek, InvestigateWest",,,,,https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2025/04/05/emails-show-coordination-between-deputies-in-idahos-kootenai-county-and-immigration-officials/,"In late January, federal immigration officials got a lead on three people in Idaho they thought, based on information shared by Kootenai County Deputy Harvey Ballman, “may be illegal.”  Not only that, but Ballman was “more than willing to send us more information in the future,” wrote one Border Patrol agent in an email, passing [&#8230;]","In late January, federal immigration officials got a lead on three people in Idaho they thought, based on information shared by Kootenai County Deputy Harvey Ballman, “may be illegal.” 
Not only that, but Ballman was “more than willing to send us more information in the future,” wrote one Border Patrol agent in an email, passing along the addresses from Ballman of the three targets of immigration enforcement weeks into President Donald Trump’s second term. 
Two of the three people were ordered to be deported, according to Matt Phelps with the Border Patrol’s Targeting and Intelligence Division. 
None had been actively committing a crime, and it’d been two years since one of the three had been arrested. 
“I want to thank you for providing the information,” Phelps wrote to Ballman. “If you or any of your LEO partners have information on individuals you have encountered or encounter in the future that you suspect may be illegally present in the US, feel free to send me that information and I will research them to determine if they are valid targets for enforcement.”
Ballman responded: “good to hear. I’ll pass on your info to the rest of our patrol division. We have lots of work for you guys.”
The emails, among a trove obtained by InvestigateWest in a public records request, provide a window into the level of coordination between federal immigration authorities and the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office in North Idaho. As the federal push to deport undocumented immigrants proceeds — and as state and local agencies take different paths on how, or whether, to assist — Kootenai County has been particularly willing to join in the deportation effort.
Sheriff Bob Norris, who represents one of the more conservative counties in a state where two-thirds of voters cast ballots for Trump, has announced that he would use all of his department’s resources to help with deportations. The county jail has taken in 72 people on immigration holds, including many arrested by the Border Patrol across in neighboring Washington, where state law prohibits using jails for immigration offenses.
Since taking office, Trump has encouraged local and state law enforcement agencies to collaborate with federal immigration agents to help with deportation efforts, and several states now have agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to assist in immigration enforcement. Norris has been eager to help, regardless of whether an undocumented person has committed a state crime. 
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that immigration enforcement is the sole duty of the federal government and local police may assist under federal direction. Immigration lawyers and immigrant advocates warn that close collaboration between local police and federal immigration agents could undermine the main goal of state and local law enforcement, which is to deter and solve crimes.
“If somebody is undocumented and they’ve experienced a very serious crime, or seen a very serious crime, they may not be willing to come forward about that if the reality is that they would be then reported to ICE for immigration enforcement,” said Geoffrey Heeren, law professor and director of the Immigration Litigation and Appellate Clinic at the University of Idaho. 
When asked if the fear of deportation could deter victims and witnesses of crimes from reporting them and impede law enforcement, Kootenai County Lt. Jeff Howard said “it can” and didn’t elaborate.
“We’re not going to hide people who are accused of a crime one way or another,” Howard told InvestigateWest.  
The “crime” he referred to was being present in the U.S. without authorization, a federal civil offense not typically enforced by local authorities. 
“If you’re in the country illegally,” Howard said, “we’re going to notify Border Patrol.” 
‘Idaho encourages cooperation’ 
InvestigateWest reviewed a month of emails between Kootenai County deputies and federal immigration agents to understand how communication and immigration enforcement may have changed since the election. There were 393 emails between the two agencies from Jan. 1, 2025,  to Feb. 4, 2025, that show a close level of coordination between the two agencies.
In one message, Border Patrol agents asked deputies about a man from Zimbabwe with an Idaho driver’s license in the jail. In another, a Border Patrol agent offered deputies “informal training” to look for signs of “the presence of criminal aliens” and to “provide real time feedback and record checks for possible … suspects without having to go through a lengthy process from another federal agency.” 
Edward Dean, a spokesperson for the U.S. Border Patrol’s Spokane Sector, first told InvestigateWest that the agency doesn’t typically do informal or formal training with law enforcement. After he was shown the email, he shifted his stance and said the Spokane Sector “encourages” ad hoc, informal training and intelligence sharing in ride-alongs and informal meetings. 
“Not surprised this is happening,” Alycia Moss, a Coeur d’Alene immigration attorney, said in an email after reviewing some of the correspondence. “Idaho is a state that encourages cooperation with ICE and (Border Patrol) and likely will continue to.”
The emails mostly include Border Patrol agents notifying the Kootenai County jail when they’ve arrested someone and planned to place them in the jail with an immigration hold. 
Border Patrol agents have placed 72 immigration holds on individuals in the jail since the beginning of the year. This is an increase since before Trump took office, Moss said. 
“Once Trump became president, there was a significant uptick in Border Patrol holds in the Kootenai County jail,” Moss said. “So before, you’d see maybe a couple, and now you’re seeing more like a couple handfuls.” 
Norris has focused heavily on immigration since he became Kootenai County sheriff in 2020, after retiring from the Los Angeles Police Department. In public statements, he has associated Spanish-speakers with being “illegal,” said deputies would assist in deporting any noncitizens who are in the country illegally even without criminal backgrounds and suggested they all “self-deport.” 
“Criminals and illegal aliens be aware Kootenai County is a Sanctuary County for all Law-Abiding citizens of the United States who are here legally,” Norris said in a news release in February. 
In the same statement, he said deputies and Border Patrol agents would be working “in tandem” and “in the same vehicle at times.” 
Norris also made headlines in 2023 for removing library books from a public library and refusing to return them because he thought they were “disturbing.” Most recently, he threatened to arrest a woman who was protesting inside a legislative town hall and stood by while private security dragged her out of the venue. 
The sheriff’s stance on immigrants has trickled down to his deputies, the emails show. A deputy also reached out to ICE to ask about participating in the federal 287(g) program, which is a program with ICE where local police can engage in some immigration enforcement. 
“We already cooperate with you by housing inmates, but want to become a more involved partner,” wrote Kootenai County sheriff’s Capt. Jeremy Hyle. 
Kootenai County doesn’t have any formal agreements with ICE or Border Patrol, but the sheriff’s office follows the informal guidance of the National Sheriffs’ Association. In an email to sheriffs across the country, obtained by InvestigateWest, the association wrote at the end of February that ICE had logged around 700,000 civil arrest warrants for illegal entry. 
“As a result, during everyday policing activities, your personnel may encounter someone who has an ICE administrative warrant now entered into this system,” Jonathan Thompson, executive director of the National Sheriffs’ Association, wrote in the email.
He explained in the email that agencies without a 287(g) agreement could not arrest people on the ICE warrants themselves, but said they can detain them if they are arrested on suspicion of a state crime. If no crime is suspected, Thompson wrote that police should contact ICE and request that federal agents come arrest the person. If ICE agents can’t make it, he wrote, “your only real option is to collect as much information from the person as you can and release the person and ICE will have to try to find them through their fugitive operations.” 
Just three Idaho counties have 287(g) agreements with ICE: Gooding, Power and Owyhee counties. Only Owyhee County has an agreement under the task force model where officers can perform immigration enforcement. 
The Trump administration in January issued an executive order to encourage widespread 287(g) agreements between local law enforcement and ICE. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered all law enforcement agencies to enter the agreements. 
Idaho Gov. Brad Little issued an executive order in February that ordered all law enforcement agencies to consider entering 287(g) agreements with ICE. He also said “to the maximum extent possible permitted by law, state agencies shall continue collaborating with ICE” to focus on deporting undocumented people “with criminal records who pose a threat to public safety.” 
In states like Idaho that encourage information sharing with federal immigration agents, it isn’t illegal to share the immigration status of a person if it comes out during investigation of a state crime, but without a 287(g) agreement, it is illegal to serve federal immigration warrants and investigate people’s immigration statuses as local law enforcement. 
“Typically, state and local officers are not supposed to be enforcing immigration law, because that’s an exclusively federal arena, with some exceptions, so if they are going out and enforcing immigration law and investigating immigration violations without a formal agreement with the federal government to do so, that would be problematic,” said Heeren, the Idaho law professor.
Howard said typically when deputies are investigating a crime, they will ask for a person’s passport or other citizenship documentation. If deputies find out they are not U.S. citizens, they will contact Border Patrol agents.
“To see if (Border Patrol has) them in their system, and if they do, and it is somebody who crossed the border and they’re not supposed to be there, then they usually come out (and arrest them),” Howard said.
‘Not the worst of the worst’
Ballman did not appear to be investigating a state crime before giving federal officials the names of the three individuals who he thought were in the country illegally. No incident report was taken, records show. Yet legal experts say that by law, there would have had to be suspicion of a state crime having been committed, since the department doesn’t have the authority to carry out immigration enforcement without a 287(g) program.
“Based on the correspondence with the deputy, it appears he saw the potential for the need for Border Patrol to get involved,” Howard said. He said he didn’t know how the individuals were contacted by Ballman and didn’t respond to questions about the legality of turning them over to the Border Patrol.
But if there was no crime being investigated, it is unclear why Ballman suspected the three people were in the country illegally. Two lawyers who reviewed the correspondence with Ballman and federal agents said it could be illegal and at least questionable based on how he came under the suspicion that the individuals were in the country illegally. 
Moss said if he knew about the people’s immigration status through a law enforcement investigation, he can share that information with federal agents, but it would be improper to obtain and share their immigration status without an investigation for a state crime. 
Heeren agreed. He said police should not be suspecting people or monitoring people based on their perceived national origin. Officers are not allowed to target people for crimes based on their race or ethnicity.
“There are also problems with police officers engaging in warrantless surveillance of people if they don’t have reasonable suspicion or probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed,” Heeren said. 
Across the Idaho border with Washington, unauthorized immigrants are protected by state law from being subjected to questions about their immigration statuses by local law enforcement. Washington state law prohibits state and local law officers from enforcing federal immigration law and from sharing non-publicly available personal information with federal immigration authorities in any noncriminal matter. Idaho has no such law. All local jails accept immigration detainees for ICE and Border Patrol. 
Little signed a bill March 27 that would make illegal immigration a state crime and would allow law enforcement to ask about someone’s immigration status if they were arrested for a separate crime. The law was immediately blocked by an Idaho district court judge after the ACLU of Idaho filed a lawsuit against it.
The cross-border clash in approaches stands as an example of the local impact of an expanded network of deportation efforts encouraged and created under the Trump administration.
“We’re seeing the administration rapidly laying the groundwork to expand mass deportation into many branches of government that had previously been detached from immigration functions,” said Jennyfer Mesa, executive director of Latinos en Spokane, a nonprofit dedicated to immigrant rights in Spokane. “We’re now seeing state and local authorities that are conducting immigration enforcement, and there’s more federal agents within Washington.”
On March 25, ICE arrested a longtime farmworker and union activist, Alfredo “Lelo” Juarez, in Sedro-Woolley. The Seattle Times wrote that ICE hadn’t responded to questions about why he was arrested, but is a Mexican citizen and was ordered to return there. His peers told the newspaper they worried he was arrested for his activism.
“We are seeing this time and time again,” Mesa said. “It’s not the worst of the worst getting arrested. It’s workers.”

The farm was one of thousands benefiting from a local food program recently cut by the Trump administration. (Helaina Thompson/Courtesy of Over the Moon Farm)Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
A mixed response from states
The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.
“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
Creating a new food system
In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

The legislation, brought by Rep. Katie Zolnikov, R-Billings, creates a new third-party license which allows off-premises licensees the ability to utilize a delivery licensee and its drivers to deliver beer and table wine.
During a Senate hearing on Feb. 18, Zolnikov said the bill was three years in the making.
“I’m pretty confident that we have thought of every situation imaginable for alcohol delivery,” Zolnikov said during the hearing.
There are very specific stipulations for delivery in the bill and drivers will be asked to use, “identification scanning software technology or an alternative approved by the department” to verify a recipient’s age. Delivery drivers will have to go through a responsible server program, be at least 21 years of age and are not allowed to deliver to obviously intoxicated people.
Drivers cannot deliver to campuses and cannot have a felony, unless they have had their driving rights restored. They also cannot have a DUI charge in the last seven years.
Alcohol must be in a cargo area of the vehicle and out of the reach of the driver. There’s even a stipulation for bicycle delivery.
“I don’t know if there’ll be many deliveries by bicycle,” Zolnikov said in the Senate hearing, “But I like to know that all of our bases are covered, just in case. Maybe in Missoula.”
The delivery industry celebrated the legislation.
“By signing this bill, Governor Gianforte is putting local business, delivery workers, and customers first,” said Anna Powell, a senior manager for DoorDash in a statement. “We are pleased to see that beer and wine delivery will soon be available via Montana grocery stores, and we look forward to offering safe and responsible delivery throughout the state.” 
In statistics provided by DoorDash, the number of U.S. merchants selling alcohol on the app increased by 37% over the course of 2023. Drivers earned, on average, nearly 20% more on deliveries with alcohol compared with deliveries without, according to the company.

(John Gray/Verite News)NEW ORLEANS – Owners and operators of independent restaurants are bracing for the impact that new tariffs will have on their businesses.
This week, President Donald Trump announced new “reciprocal tariffs” for specific U.S. trade partners and a universal 10% tariff on other foreign goods.
The universal 10% tariff will take effect Saturday. The individualized, reciprocal tariffs take effect Wednesday.
Businesses buying goods from suppliers expect to take on the higher costs of importing them. For restaurants that buy a lot of food products cultivated in foreign countries, the cost of the tariffs will be noticeable.
“Our backs are really against the wall right now. We don’t really want to raise prices. But if we had to in order to stay in business, we would be forced into doing it,” said Paul Rotner, CEO of Acme Oyster House.
Prior to Trump’s unveiling of the new tariffs Wednesday, the National Restaurant Association had predicted an estimated 30% profit loss for independent restaurant owners in the country.
“Applying new tariffs at this scale will create change and disruption that restaurant operators will have to navigate to keep their restaurants open,” said association CEO Michelle Korsmo in a Wednesday statement.
Most notably, China was hit with a 34% tariff and the European Union was hit with a 20% tariff. Together, they account for 31.9% of imported goods to the U.S, according to data presented by Trump.
Though not included among countries receiving “reciprocal tariffs,” Mexico and Canada are both subject to 25% tariffs on some items. However, the tariffs only apply to goods not compliant with the USMCA, a trade agreement passed in 2020. According to a 2019 analysis of the USMCA, most agricultural products from Mexico and Canada are compliant and thus exempt from tariffs.
Acme Oyster House sources a lot of its produce from Mexico during this time of year, Rotner said. But he’s expecting the biggest financial hit to come from higher-priced kitchen equipment. In February, Trump instated a 25% tariff on foreign steel and aluminum.
“It’s tough. We’re pinching pennies right now and it’s going to be even harder,” Rotner said.
The restaurant industry experienced similar struggles during the COVID-19 pandemic and the inflation that followed, which drove up prices for food products, causing restaurants to make adjustments to stay afloat financially.
Now faced with rising costs again, most restaurateurs are concerned about the new tariffs, said Kristin Sparks, co-owner of Annunciation Restaurant. She said she will have to scrutinize costs further and spend extra time shopping around for suppliers offering the best prices for foreign goods.
She wants to avoid passing those costs on to customers, but is grappling with the fact that it might be necessary.
“But there’s a balance, there’s a fine line between what the consumer is willing to pay,” Sparks said. “And right now, consumer confidence is also unfortunately moving on a downward track. So, they may not want to pay those higher prices.”
And the impact goes beyond just the bottom line.
“With all of those additional costs, then you start to kind of have to pivot with menu planning, changing your menu, how might it affect what you’re serving to your guests … There’s a lot that goes into it,” Sparks said.
With different suppliers offering varying qualities of food products, operators will have to decide if they want to sacrifice food quality for a lower price.
JD Eubanks, executive chef at Tujague’s Restaurant, plans to stick with purchasing high-quality ingredients, even if it means potentially raising menu prices to recover the extra money spent on higher taxed goods.
“There’s some people that don’t really have that mindset,” Eubanks said. “They’re not going to want to buy the more responsibly sourced products, and they don’t care.”
He said it’s particularly an issue when it comes to suppliers handling animals, such as dairy cows and chickens.
“You always want to serve the best, and if you want to get the best, you have to make sure it’s good quality, humanely raised,” he said. “And to get those things it costs more money to produce, because you have to do a lot more humane practices.”
And while the restaurant always tries to buy local when possible, some of the goods needed for its French-inspired menu can’t be found in the U.S., like specific cheeses used for charcuterie boards.
“Constantly – as a restaurant owner, chef, whatever it may be – you’re shopping for the best price. And tariffs, that’s going to affect a lot of those things,” he said.

(Photo by William Meacham/Special to the SC Daily Gazette) COLUMBIA — SC Daily Gazette senior reporter Jessica Holdman took top honors for business journalism at the South Carolina Press Association’s annual awards ceremony Friday.
Her awards were among five total won by the Gazette in its inaugural year. The nonprofit news outlet competed in Division A, the category for the state’s largest daily newspapers. That means the Gazette was competing against colleagues with The Post and Courier, The State, and the Greenville News.
Holdman won the Ken Baldwin Award for Excellence in Business Journalism for all daily news outlets in South Carolina as well as first place in business beat reporting for Division A.
Reporter Skylar Laird received two Division A awards: second place in breaking news reporting and third place in education beat reporting.
And contributing columnist Paul Hyde won second place for column writing.
The annual contest awarded the state’s best in journalism — including articles, photos, columns, editorials, and page layouts — published between mid-November 2023 and mid-November 2024. For the Gazette, however, entries covered the six months since it became a press association member.
Winners of most categories were declared weeks ahead of the event. But the Ken Baldwin Award was among contests unannounced until the presentation Friday at the Columbia Metropolitan Convention Center.
The award, sponsored by the University of South Carolina’s journalism school, is named in memory of Kenneth W. Baldwin Jr., a USC graduate and benefactor of financial journalism education. The former business editor died in 2022 at age 96.
Contest judges said Holdman “examined business and economic development matters broadly, including their history and possible future impact.
“Her reporting covers everything from the emerging issues related to lithium battery manufacturing to the future of South Carolina’s once-dominating textile industry,” they wrote in explaining their choice. “Her work is very well done and well-researched. But most of all her stories are interesting, appealing not only to business ‘readers’ but everyone.”

The Baldwin award came with a $500 prize.
Holdman’s winning entries for her first-place business beat award included reports on emergency responders’ preparations for lithium fires, the transformation of the state’s textile industry, and a real estate developer’s lucrative leasing arrangement with the state.
Laird’s award for breaking news involved her reporting on the Medical University of South Carolina’s decision to end all gender-transition treatments — which provided answers to readers that MUSC hadn’t provided its own patients at the time and ahead of other outlets — and the scrambling of LGBTQ advocates to connect patients with care elsewhere.
Her award for education reporting involved students enrolled for state-paid K-12 scholarships in the program’s first year, parents left in limbo after the state Supreme Court declared the private tuition payments illegal, and a surprisingly high number of 3- and 4-year-olds suspended from South Carolina preschools.
In opinion writing, Hyde’s winning columns advocated closing the “Charleston loophole” as a memorial to the nine victims gunned down in a Charleston church in 2015, examined the legacy of the 1934 Bloody Thursday massacre of striking mill workers in Honea Path, and emphasized the importance of voting in state and local elections.

The findings were part of a study published in the journal Global [&#8230;]","A spawning redband trout from the Upper Klamath Basin. (Photo by Jonny Armstrong, courtesy of Oregon State University)Some already threatened cold-water fish species in the Northwest will not only face shrinking habitat from climate change but will face growing pressure from invasive fish species fleeing their own warming and dwindling waters, according to modeling from researchers at Oregon State University.
The findings were part of a study published in the journal Global Change Biology by fisheries professor Guillermo Giannico, associate fisheries professor Ivan Arismendi and graduate student Arif Jan. The three found that climate change is likely to compel all kinds of species migration that could lead to increased predation, competition and some localized extinctions of once native species in the Northwest and globally.
Giannico said their models can be run on most species in the world. But for their recent study, the three zeroed in on the northern migration of non-native smallmouth bass and northern pike into threatened and endangered native redband and bull trout habitat in the Northwest. All four of the species are likely to lose habitat as climate change accelerates and are likely to seek homes in colder water at higher elevations.
They created maps using ecological data that indicate the breadth of territory where each species lives and then modeled the impact of changing conditions such as higher temperatures and drought projected through 2070 to see how that would influence the range of all four species’ movement and overlap.
“We forecast how these species would respond to those changing conditions by disappearing from certain regions that will be too warm for them, and appearing in others that maybe today are too cold, but they would be more suitable in the future,” Giannico said. “Because not all shifts are equal, there will be areas where they will be more crowded together, and they would overlap more, and areas where they wouldn’t overlap that much.”
Of great concern is the migration of aggressive and predatory northern pike into redband and bull trout territory, and the increasing likelihood the two will overlap more frequently.
“They all shift, but they end up shifting in a way that the amount of overlap in their distribution is going to be greater,” Giannico explained. “It’s like you have less room to avoid nasty people at the party, and you end up being cornered in the same part of the room with the same people you don’t enjoy, and you’re all packed in the wrong place with the wrong companion.”










The researchers fear that this increased negative interaction could lead to local extinctions of some native salmonids, similar to those occurring among shrinking populations of bull and rainbow trout from invasive species in southeastern Alaska.



	Giannico said researchers have long separately studied how climate change will compel the migration of some species and how native species respond to the introduction of invasive species. The modeling done by the Oregon State scientists is an effort to combine the two, and to show how species’ habitats will overlap as climate change compels both native and nonnative species in an area to migrate and cohabitate.
The researchers fear that this increased negative interaction could lead to local extinctions of some native salmonids, similar to those occurring among shrinking populations of bull and rainbow trout from invasive species in southeastern Alaska, Giannico said.

No Democrats backed the bill and no Democratic amendments were accepted during an overnight marathon voting session.Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul were the only two Republicans who voted against the resolution, which needed only a majority vote under the complicated process being used in the Senate.The lengthy voting session, known as the vote-a-rama, included debate on 28 amendments, with one adopted.Alaska Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan was the only member of either party to have their change agreed to, following a 51-48 vote. His amendment addressed Medicaid, which has become a flash point in the battle over the budget this year, as well as Medicare.Sullivan said his proposal would strengthen Medicaid, the state-federal health program for lower-income people that House GOP lawmakers are looking at as one place to cut spending, and Medicare, the health insurance program for seniors and some people with disabilities.“We should all want to weed out waste, fraud and abuse in Medicaid and Medicare, and we must keep these programs going. We should do both,” Sullivan said.Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden spoke against the amendment, saying it didn’t clearly define which “vulnerable people” would have their access to Medicare and Medicaid protected.“By not defining the vulnerable, the Sullivan amendment is code for states to cut benefits or kick people off their coverage altogether,” Wyden said. “To me, the Sullivan amendment basically says if somebody thinks you’re not poor enough, you’re not sick enough, or you’re not disabled enough, we’re not going to be there for you.”Democrats unsuccessfully offered messaging amendments dealing with everything from Social Security phone service to the minimum wage to contracts with farmers.‘Start the game’Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said during a floor speech Friday the budget resolution will clear the way for lawmakers to extend the 2017 tax cuts permanently, bolster federal spending on border security and defense, rewrite energy policy and cut spending.“The resolution opens up that process that will be done by the House and Senate authorizing committees,” Graham said. “So this doesn’t do anything other than start the game and it’s time this game started.”Wyden, ranking member on the Senate Finance Committee, vehemently opposed the budget resolution, saying the tax cuts it sets up would predominantly help the wealthy.Wyden argued the tariffs that President Donald Trump has instituted would negate any potential positive impacts of the upcoming GOP tax cuts. The tariffs sent markets diving on Friday for a second day in a row.“People following along at home are going to hear a lot of sweet-sounding promises from Republicans about what they’re trying to accomplish,” Wyden said. “They claim their tax bill is just all unicorns and rainbows. They’ll say everybody is going to benefit from a tax cut and typical families will get the help they need. They’ll promise rising wages and a booming economy.“It’s just not true. The reality is, unless you’re way out at the upper end of the income scale, any benefit you get from this Republican bill is going to get blown out of the water as the Trump tariffs continue to hike inflation.”Paul said during floor debate that he was “concerned” about how his colleagues had written the measure.“What worries me is that so many things in Washington are smoke and mirrors,” Paul said. “On the one hand, it appears as if all of this great savings is happening. But on the other hand, the resolution before us will increase the debt by $5 trillion.”Paul offered an amendment that would have changed those instructions to set up a three-month debt limit extension, but it was not agreed to following a vote of 5-94.Framework for tax hikes and policy billCongress’ budget isn’t a bill but a concurrent resolution, meaning it never goes to the president for a signature. Its various provisions take effect once both chambers vote to adopt the same version.The budget resolution also doesn’t include any real money, just plans for the next decade.But it does lay the groundwork for the GOP to use the complex reconciliation process to extend the 2017 tax law, much of which was set to expire at the end of this year.Republicans plan to use that reconciliation bill to boost spending on border security and defense by hundreds of billions of dollars and make changes to energy policy.The budget resolution also includes instructions to raise the debt limit by between $4 and $5 trillion later this year.The reconciliation instructions give a dozen House committees and 10 Senate committees targets for how much they can increase the deficit or how much they need to cut spending when they draft their pieces of the package.All of those panels are supposed to send their bills to the Budget committees before May 9, so they can be bundled together in one package and sent to the floor.The House GOP set a minimum of $1.5 trillion in spending cuts, while Republicans in the Senate set a floor of $4 billion in funding reductions. Those vast differences foreshadow an internal GOP struggle to achieve a final deal.Nearly $6 trillion deficit increaseThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office will ultimately calculate the deficit impact of the reconciliation bill once it’s written, but several outside organizations have said they disagree with how Republicans are moving forward. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget released an analysis Friday showing the reconciliation bill would increase deficits during the next decade by nearly $6 trillion.“A $5.8 trillion deficit-increasing bill would be unprecedented,” CRFB’s analysis states. “It would add 14 times as much to the deficit than the bipartisan infrastructure law ($400 billion), more than three times as much as American Rescue Plan ($1.8 trillion), three times the 2020 CARES Act ($1.7 trillion), and nearly four times the original score of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ($1.5 trillion). In fact, it would add more to the deficit than all four of these major laws combined.”Sharon Parrott, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, wrote in a statement “the tax cuts called for in the budget plan are so expensive that deficits will rise substantially, raising economic risks associated with higher debt in service to expensive tax cuts skewed to the wealthy.”“Policymakers need to course-correct and remember their campaign pledges to help ease families’ strained budgets, not contort the budget to the desires of the very wealthy,” Parrott wrote. “That would mean crafting a budget bill that doesn’t raise families’ health and grocery costs but instead invests in making health care more affordable and expands the Child Tax Credit to support families who face challenges affording the basics. These investments and lower deficits can be achieved by a sounder tax policy that requires corporations and the wealthy — who benefit enormously from public investments — to pay their fair share.”An analysis from The Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, called the GOP budget resolution a “fiscal train wreck.”Romina Boccia, director of budget and entitlement policy, and Dominik Lett, a budget and entitlement policy analyst, wrote that Republicans need to start over.“This budget isn’t just a missed opportunity; it actively worsens our nation’s debt trajectory,” they wrote. “The resolution abandons the House’s concrete spending reductions desperately needed in today’s high-debt environment, sets a dangerous precedent by adopting a so-called current policy baseline that hides the very real deficit impact of extending tax cuts, and adds hundreds of billions in new deficit spending.

Despite lyrics like “Cadillac and tourmaline, Lighthouses and LL Bean, hardest workin’ folks you’ll ever know,” senators rejected the committee recommendation to adopt the song (LD 373) by a vote of 12-17 though their colleagues in the House backed the tune 91-52. With a divided report, the issue will be back before senators next week. 
The House also saw a lengthy discussion about the preservation of Sears Island, which has been slated to be the new home of an offshore wind port (if that comes to fruition).
Gov. Janet Mills signed emergency legislation (LD 966) passed by both chambers that will allow access by state agencies and hospitals to certain confidential probate court records if the access is in the public interest.
Other votes of note:
Senators voted Tuesday to confirm D’arcy Main-Boyington for appointment to the Gambling Control Board.
Following engrossment in the Senate, the House almost unanimously passed an emergency measure (LD 466) to extend the law governing electric power and service residential rates for military veterans organizations.
Rep. Randall Greenwood (R-Wales) asked for a roll call vote for the enactment of LD 100, “An Act to Increase the Expenditure Limit for the Informal Bidding Process for the Selection of Professional, Architect and Engineer Services,” which had already passed both chambers. Greenwood argued the bill allowed the state to award contracts “to friends and neighbors without going through a formal bidding process,” to which Rep. Sue Salisbury (D-Westbrook) replied that the bill was requested by the department to “make it a more tenable process.” It was enacted by a vote of 72-68.
After several speeches on the importance of conserving the beauty and cultural significance of Sears Island, the House voted 76-68 in favor of the Energy Committee’s recommendation against LD 226, which would extend existing conservation easement protections to cover more of Sears Island, including a portion that has been reserved for development of an offshore wind port by the Maine Department of Transportation. Bill sponsor Rep. Reagan Paul requested a roll call, and encouraged her colleagues to support the bill saying it is not about offshore wind but rather about protecting Sears island. Paul said opponents of the bill had intentionally misframed its intent. 
A bill (LD 80) to establish the Seppala Siberian sleddog as the official state dog passed under the hammer.
The House on Thursday unanimously passed an amended version of LD 48 “An Act to Update References to the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 Contained in the Maine Revised Statutes,” which Rep. Shelley Rudnicki explained, is done every year “to be in conformity with the federal government and make it easier for taxpayers.:

McNamara Federal Building in Detroit on Friday in defense of government employees, Social Security and the right to collective bargaining. 
Joined by U.S. Reps. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor), Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit), AFGE members stressed the importance of preserving the Social Security Administration, while warning how cuts to their agencies could impact seniors, veterans and other vulnerable Americans. 
“Federal employees are facing a threat from two entities, one entity is destroying our federal unions, and the second entity is trying to destroy our legal right to collective bargaining….We are here to tell you what that entity is doing to the federal workforce is directly harming services that we provide to our public,” said Monique Buchanan, president of AFGE Local 3239.

Following an executive order last week instructing several government agencies to end collective bargaining with federal labor unions, citing concerns of national security, the AFGE and several other unions have filed suit against the Trump administration, arguing the order violates the Constitution. 
“Collective bargaining agreements are built on agreements the union and the agency made together as a mutually agreed policy document that both union and management are to abide by. The CBA [collective bargaining agreements] allows for us to ensure all employees are treated fairly in all aspects of work. Stripping the contract or CBA will potentially cause major disruptions within our agencies, and it could affect our ability to provide services to this country,” Buchanan said. 
Additionally, efforts to cut significant amounts of staff and resources from multiple federal agencies are intended to collapse them, putting them on the path to privatization, Buchanan said. 
“Privatizing means the top 2% of this country can obtain federal contracts to take over the work of our federal agencies. Privatization will replace skilled, knowledgeable, educated, hard working employees who have been through extensive training, potentially with AI and or a replacement staff who cannot touch the world class service we provide,” she said.

Dingell spoke out against the demonization of government workers, pointing to the work they do to keep people across the nation safe. 
“The federal and government employees takes care of the veterans at all the [Department of Veterans Affairs] hospitals and make sure they get the health care they need. When I’m flying, it’s air traffic controllers that keep us safe and they aren’t recognized. They don’t have enough of them, and we need to support them, not demonize them,” Dingell said. 
She also pointed to recent mass layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services, calling them “terrifying.”
Dingell also detailed the history of Social Security, noting that her father in law, the late John Dingell Sr., co-sponsored the bill to create the Social Security Administration. 
“Why? Because more than half the seniors, children of people who had died and people with disabilities,were living in poverty and did not know how they were going to eat, or where they were going to live. And this country recognized that if you’ve worked hard your entire life, that you should be able to live your senior years with dignity and respect, and they created Social Security to address that problem,” she said.

While Trump pledged not to touch Social Security in proposed cuts to government spending, the president, alongside billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency, have cut several thousand employees with the administration seeking to reduce its workforce by 7,000 employees.
Although the Social Security Administration was previously planning to eliminate phone services for Americans filing for benefits, The Washington Post reported the administration has since scrapped that plan, but will require individuals filing for retirement or survivor benefits or requesting direct deposit for their checks to verify their identity online or in person beginning April 14. 
“We have a moral responsibility to protect our seniors, people with disabilities and the children of those that have died and need that help. And if America cannot honor their promise to their seniors, then we need to look ourselves in the mirror and ask who we are,” Dingell said.

Dingell Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, called the Trump Administration’s job cuts an attack on servicemembers, noting that 27% of VA employees and 30% of all federal employees are veterans. 
Tricia Paff, president of AFGE local 3907 who is based at the Environmental Protection Agency’s National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, spoke out on proposed cuts to the EPA, noting its role is ensuring there is clean water, clean air and protecting human health and addressing climate change. 
“The Trump administration can fire scientists. They can try to remove the words climate change from EPA websites, policies, contracts, but these actions will not protect Americans from intensifying climate extremes,” Paff said, pointing to the damage from Hurricane Helene as one example.

As cuts to Social Security employees generate uncertainty for those relying on benefits, Tlaib, who is serving her fourth term in the U.S. House, said she has never seen as many people breaking down at her town halls or calling her office as she has in recent months. 
“They break your heart because they feel helpless. They’re like always on edge because they think tomorrow that check is not going to come…. I even had a veteran tell me they canceled his appointments, and now he can’t get in for another three months. Why? Because when they cut federal workforce, they’re cutting federal programs and services. People are going to wait longer. People are already feeling like they don’t matter,” she said.
Stevens shared a story of a similar call from a disabled veteran who was unsure if he would be able to continue receiving his medical benefits. 
“How is that even a question? That shouldn’t be a question for us.” she said.

While closing out the rally, AFGE National President Everett Kelley said people often don’t recognize who federal employees are. 
“Let me tell you who they are. These are the people that work at the VA that make sure that veterans are cared for every single day, and they do that job so well that nobody pays them attention. These are the people that work at the EPA that do that job so well that nobody pays them attention. Because nobody pays their attention as long as the air that we breathe is good, as long as the water that we drink is good water,” Kelley said. 
“Nobody pays any attention when they fly through the sky, because there’s a federal employee at the TSA that makes sure that we fly safely,” Kelley said. 
However, the Trump administration came for them, Kelley said, pointing to Project 2025, the conservative Heritage Foundation’s nearly 900 page blueprint for reshaping the federal government, as the warning that the Trump administration would aim to eliminate a number of federal employees. 
He also took aim at Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. 
“I say it’s the Department of Government Evil, because it’s downright evil to take American people and just destroy their well being,” Kelley said. 
As the administration continues to attack government workers, Kelley told AFGE members they need to call it like it is, pointing to comments from U.S. Judge William Alsup in his order requiring federal agencies to rehire tens of thousands of probationary federal employees that were fired by the United States Office of Personnel Management earlier this year where he called the mass firings a sham strategy to sidestep requirements for reducing the federal workforce. 
“I’m not afraid. I learned that I gotta speak truth to power. If it’s the last thing I do, I’m going to speak truth to power, and I’m here to tell this administration that we are going nowhere,” Kelley said.

March marked one year since officials first reported Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza — H5N1 — among dairy cattle. Since then, bird flu has infected 996 herds across the country, including 19 cases in the last month in California and Idaho.
New Mexico reported nine dairy herds in Curry County tested positive last April, and began milk testing its cattle in February following the rollout of a federal program.
The most recent results from milk-testing programs revealed that while more than 95% of the 93 cow herds in the state tested negative, a small set of inconsistent positives — all from three Curry County herds infected last year — remain, according to New Mexico State Veterinarian Samantha Holeck.
Enter the mystery: The cows themselves do not test positive, nor do they demonstrate the symptoms documented in the earlier avian flu outbreak, she said, such as huge drops in milk production.
“It’s been a real challenge to try to understand how it continues to circulate in some of these herds,” Holeck said.

New Mexico is partnering up with veterinarians in the U.S. Department of Agriculture to research the viral fragments found in the milk and sent samples to the federal National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa.
“I know we’re a year into this situation now,” Holeck said, “but it seems like there’s still just so much to try to understand.”
New Mexico isn’t alone in experiencing the viral fragments, said Michael Payne, a food animal veterinarian at University of California, Davis, who noted there have been reports of similar persistent positives in quarantined herds there.
“I wouldn’t diminish the importance of it being small,” Payne said. “Yes, we’re talking about low levels of virus and yes, we’re talking about cows not getting sick, but it’s important that we’re not exactly sure where it’s coming from, and that in and of itself merits examination.”
He said more than $2 million dollars of research is being conducted in California on avian flu transmission across a dozen projects; including examining if it’s transmitted by flies; blowing in from dust storms; or carried by birds outside of waterfowl.
“It will be critical that we figure out how the disease is moving and how it’s changing,” Payne said.
 ‘Science is still very much in its infancy’

While scientists need to perform more research, Payne posited some possibilities for the detection of viral fragments: they could signify a different and less potent version of the virus; cooler weather might allow more viral fragments to survive in the bulk tanks, compared to the triple-digit temperatures in the fall; cows may have developed “herd immunity” against the virus.
“It could be that much smaller numbers of cattle are being exposed and are becoming infected, which has resulted in a much, much lower level of virus that’s being detected inside the bulk tanks,” Payne said. “It’s an area of active research.”
Veterinarian Andrew Bowman, a molecular epidemiologist at Ohio State University, said laboratory tests’ sensitivity could also be a factor: They may be picking up positives from environmental contamination in the tanks or on the farms.
“It doesn’t take much; we’re talking a few copies of the viral genome to be present in a sample to send it positive,” Bowman said. “We can pick up a positive that’s likely not a viable virus.”
Since the development of HPAI in cows is so new, as is the method of transmission — where the virus replicates in the mammary glands that produce milk — he said the basic questions of the interactions between the virus, the host and the environment still need answers.
“Science is still very much in the infancy of what we know about avian influenza in cattle,” Bowman said.
 Offering reassurances

While scientists say it’s important to unravel the mystery of the viral fragments to better understand how the virus might change or spread in dairy cows, they also emphasize that risk to the public from avian influenza remains low.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports transmission of avian flu can occur from contact with milk from infected cows; eating, drinking or inhaling droplets contaminated with live virus; touching the live or dead bodies of infected animals. Thus far, the CDC has no documented human-to-human transmission. As of April 1, 70 people had contracted H5N1, mostly California farmworkers.
Most milk sold in the U.S. is heated to a temperature to kill bacteria and viruses, called pasteurization. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration tested milk products in 17 states and, finding no live viruses, reported that “pasteurization is effective at inactivating H5N1, and that the commercial, pasteurized milk supply is safe.”
Federal officials, however, warn that unpasteurized milk, also called raw milk, is unsafe to drink. Research from the National Institutes of Health in June using infected raw milk from New Mexico found that the H5N1 virus had survived for at least five weeks in refrigerated conditions. Further, mice that consumed the raw milk showed signs of illness, which  researchers suggest indicates drinking raw milk can transmit the virus to other organisms.
Holeck emphasized that New Mexico milk is safe.
“For dairies, it’s standard routine if they have sick cows for any reason, not just [avian flu], that milk is always diverted out from the milk supply, it doesn’t enter commerce,” she said.

In an August meeting of the board of the Tennessee Valley Authority, the nation’s largest public power company, board member Michelle Moore reminded her colleagues of what’s written above the door of its headquarters.
“‘For the people’ … is written over TVA’s front door,” she said. “And in that spirit, I just encourage TVA to find right ways to share any proposed future rate adjustment proposals broadly, so that everyone has the opportunity to get informed, get engaged and bring their perspectives forward.”
In that meeting, Moore dissented on a vote over the company’s budget, which she said unwisely delegated decision-making authority on capital projects, including fossil fuel investments, away from the board.

Less than a year later, President Donald Trump fired Moore without publicly providing a reason, a decision revealed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
“L. Michelle Moore’s appointment as a member of the Tennessee Valley Authority Board of Directors ended March 27, 2025, at the direction of the President of the United States,” the filing states.
Moore has consistently been viewed by environmentalists as the most reasonable member of TVA’s board, often dissenting from decisions that doubled down on fossil fuels. She serves as the CEO of Groundswell, a clean energy nonprofit “that builds community power by eliminating energy burdens and increasing economic opportunity with community solar, resilience centers, residential energy efficiency, and pioneering research.”
Trump’s apparent decision to fire Moore comes just a week after Tennessee’s U.S. Senators, Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty, argued for a shakeup of TVA leadership in an op-ed.
“The current TVA board focused on the diversity of its executives ahead of job creation for hungry workers in the region it is supposed to serve,” the op-ed said. “It has fallen victim to paralysis by analysis…”
Moore was nominated to serve on the TVA board by President Joe Biden in 2021.
In a statement, Stephen A. Smith, executive director for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, criticized the firing.
“We’re disappointed to see President Trump’s hyper-partisan action of removing a sitting TVA board member for no reason. This action further weakens TVA’s leadership and sets into motion actions that could have significant financial impact on TVA ratepayers across the region,” he said. “As shared in SACE’s statement about the TN senators who are asking TVA to ignore a proper financial review and analysis of unproven technologies, SACE believes that it’s inappropriate for the President or the senators to try to micromanage TVA’s decisions on energy choices across the region.”
The White House has not yet responded to a request for comment on the firing.
Gaby Sarri-Tobar, senior energy justice campaigner for the Center for Biological Diversity, called Moore’s firing “ludicrous.”
“Trump’s firing of TVA board member Michelle Moore is ludicrous and leaves our country’s largest federal utility in a precarious position,” she said. “Ten million people rely on TVA to keep the lights on, utility bills low, and for good-paying jobs. Trump’s reckless and politically targeted move will cripple the utility’s chances to secure a safe, resilient and affordable energy future for families and workers in the Valley.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/screenshot-2025-03-21-at-11.52.26-am-1024x655.png,,,2025-04-05 09:03:33.832711

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Critics told a Senate panel Friday that a bill aimed at protecting the state from billions in potential sex abuse claims is ill-advised and being rushed through in the waning days of the legislature.
The comments came during a hearing by the Judicial Proceedings Committee on House Bill 1378, which just passed the House on Thursday and could be before the full Senate as early as Saturday. Legislative leaders are rushing to beat the final day of the 2025 session on Monday.
“This is a really, really important piece of legislation. It is terrible that it’s being handled in such a quick way at the end of the session with two people speaking,” said Tom Yost, a Baltimore attorney with clients who said they were sexually abused as children while in state custody.
Corey Stern, the other witness against the bill, said it is likely unconstitutional.
“It is well settled under Maryland law that plaintiffs have a vested right in an accrued cause of action,. whether it’s based on statute or common law,” said Stern, an attorney with Levy Konigsberg, which is representing child sexual abuse clients. “The minute that Gov. Moore signed the bill into law, those rights vested for individuals who have been sexually abused.”
The law he’s referring to is the 2023 Child Victims Act that removed time limits on lawsuits by survivors of child sexual abuse against the institutions that employed their abusers. The law capped awards for such suits at $890,000 for public institutions, like state agencies, and $1.5 million for private institutions, like the Catholic Church or scouting organizations.
Thousands of claimants, representing a potentially budget-busting bilions in payouts, have since lined up against the state alone for abuse they suffered while children in state care.
Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles), himself a survivor of childhood physical and sexual abuse, had pushed for years for the Child Victims Act before winning it in 2023. But when the budget implications became clear, he introduced HB1378 a month into this year’s session.
The bill would lower the cap on lawsuits filed after June 1, from $890,000 to $400,000 for public institutions and from $1.5 million to $700,000 for private institutions. It also narrows the scope of the term “incident” so that all crimes by one abuser against one victim would count as one incident, rather than one incident for every separate assault.
The bill would also cap fees for attorneys at 20% for cases that settle out of court and 25% for cases that result from a court judgment.
Now lawmakers are racing the clock to pass the measure, with the time left in the legislative session being measured now in hours instead of days.
Del. Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore City), chair of the House Judiciary Committee, who testified Friday on behalf of Wilson, said about 1,500 lawsuits have been filed so far and another 4,000 cases are waiting to go forward. He said it’s unclear how many are against public or private entities and when they would be filed.
“We’re at a situation, we’re at a point where I believe and the House believes that it’s important for us to begin to figure out how many of these claims are out there,” he said.
Sen. Jeff Waldstreicher (D-Montgomery), vice chair of the Judicial Proceedings Committee, asked Clippinger if a suit was filed by May 31 and amended after June 1, would the suit still be eligible for any possible payments from the current law.
“I believe the rules relating to the claims initially put in would hold,” said Clippinger, who added he’s a criminal attorney and not a civil lawyer.
David Lorenz, the Maryland director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, also known as SNAP, attended Friday’s hearing but was not invited to testify, as the committee limited witnesses to keep the process moving along. He said that decreasing the cap amounts will also decrease the number of people who “would be otherwise willing to come and speak out against the abuse they endured,” at a time when what we need is “more accountability against these abusers.”
Sen. William G. Folden (R-Frederick) said Friday night the proposed bill seeks to do two things.
“I think what this bill is trying to do is find a balance between allowing those that have been victimized to have some sense of relief for their continued treatment,” he said. “But also have a balance that we’re already in a fiscal crisis to cause additional irrecoverable financial strains on the state.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/David-Lorenz-4-4-2025-1024x794.jpg,,,2025-04-05 09:03:33.832711

Between drastic cuts to federal programs, mass firings of Marylanders employed by the federal government, and tariffs that will hike prices on goods coming through the Port of Baltimore, the General Assembly is facing a crisis.
To be clear, Maryland was already in a budget hole before Donald Trump moved back into the White House. Since 2017, experts have been warning about a looming $3 billion structural deficit. This long-term shortfall was briefly masked by an influx of COVID-19 relief funds, but those federal resources have long since run out. Larry Hogan and his allies like to claim that the former Republican governor left Maryland’s finances in good shape, but they conveniently overlook how much of the state’s temporary surplus was due to one-time pandemic relief funds.
In stark contrast to his Republican predecessor, Gov. Wes Moore doesn’t have a federal financial cushion to rely on. In fact, the governor has to balance the state budget at a time when Donald Trump is starving our state of federal resources.

As a former member of Congress, I understand how uniquely exposed our state is to what happens in Washington – especially when it comes to the budget.
Cuts to federal programs, particularly in areas like health care, transportation and education, aren’t just abstract numbers on a ledger – they have real-world consequences for Marylanders. Programs like Medicaid and SNAP rely heavily on federal funding, and as those resources dwindle, the state is forced to pick up the tab so that our residents don’t get left behind.
Our proximity to Washington, D.C., also means we have a higher concentration of federal workers than most states, making us especially vulnerable to federal layoffs. When the government cuts jobs or freezes hiring, Maryland feels the pain, with thousands of families directly affected by the loss of income and stability. These layoffs ripple through our communities, affecting not just federal employees, but local businesses and services that depend on their spending power.
And with so many goods passing through the Port of Baltimore, we’re acutely susceptible to Trump’s tariffs. Tariffs on imported goods increase costs for businesses and consumers alike, disrupting supply chains and raising prices on everyday products. For Maryland, which relies heavily on trade and transportation, these tariffs could have serious economic consequences, threatening jobs at the port and in industries that depend on the goods it handles.
Despite these challenges, Gov. Moore and the General Assembly’s budget framework prioritizes what matters: cutting taxes or keeping taxes the same for 94% of Marylanders, growing our economy so we’re less reliant on Washington, and protecting the critical services Marylanders depend on, like access to health care. These priorities are correct – although the details are still getting ironed out in Annapolis.
The governor and legislature are also making tough, honest choices to ensure long-term stability, regardless of what Donald Trump does in the White House. To stimulate growth, the budget framework cuts spending by the largest amount in 16 years. It also asks the wealthiest Marylanders to pay a little bit more. I agree that it’s reasonable to ask someone who’s making over $750,000 a year to give roughly $1,800 more to support our law enforcement and firefighters, strengthen our schools and grow our economy.
I expect Gov. Moore will rise to this challenge, especially given his track record. He’s the first governor in a decade to consistently introduce budgets with general funds that were smaller than the previous year’s. He’s maintained more than $2 billion in the Rainy Day Fund each year – well above the recommended levels – and kept positive cash balances while managing crises like the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge. The governor also understands we need to support our job creators and workforce alike in order to jump-start our economy.
Donald Trump may be wreaking havoc on our federal government and our state’s finances, but Maryland has a history of resilience. With Gov. Wes Moore at the helm, I’m confident we can weather these difficult times and emerge stronger.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2208184612-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-05 08:00:25.962477

The farm was one of thousands benefiting from a local food program recently cut by the Trump administration. (Helaina Thompson/Courtesy of Over the Moon Farm)Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
 A mixed response from states

The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.
“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
 Creating a new food system

In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

During the summer of 2024, countless transgender and gender-expansive patients expressed to me fears about what might happen to their access to gender-affirming medical care if a conservative administration were to win the White House.
This worst-case scenario became reality in the first weeks of 2025, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order redefining legal gender identity as a strict binary of male and female — effectively erasing recognition of nonbinary and transgender individuals and interrupting federal funding to institutions providing gender-affirming health care.
As a transgender health program intern, I have seen providers try to reassure patients of their well-being and safety while they themselves fear how their jobs will be affected if the laws drastically alter the way we practice medicine.
As a gay man about to enter the medical profession, I am afraid. The recent wave of anti-trans initiatives pushed by this administration is part of a much broader effort to dismantle diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) programs across the country under the guise of “restoring meritocracy” and “leveling the playing field.”
But in health care, the playing field has never been level. Minority populations continue to face disproportionate health risks and barriers to care.
DEIB is the foundation of medical education. It teaches future physicians how to address these disparities and combat the structural inequities that put vulnerable patients at risk.
Studies show medical students have felt unprepared to manage transgender and gender expansive patients upon graduation. One study even claimed that only 27% of students were confident in their knowledge of the health needs of transgender patients.
Beyond that, they could not correctly answer questions about race-related medical history despite affirming that understanding historical context is important in medicine. This lack of education was always a problem, and efforts were underway to solve it. Eliminating DEIB would not only erode this progress but set us back behind where we were even before we started.
 Structural competency
In 2020, the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) rolled out the Structural Competency Curriculum, which aims to train providers “to recognize and respond to the impact of upstream, structural factors on patient health and health care.” Since then, medical schools around the country have adopted the values of this curriculum and incorporated it throughout the course of their students’ training. Health equity is a core pillar of medical students’ professional development and should be embedded into the culture of patient-centric care.
When DEIB is dismantled, programs like these disappear, and awareness of health disparities among marginalized patient populations fades from the culture of those whose job is to provide the proper care and treatment.
If physicians are not trained on specific health risks that directly impact transgender patients, how can we provide adequate care? If we are not taught about racial health disparities, how will we work to combat them? If we stop prioritizing inclusion, how can we ensure equal health care for all?
Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity. Legislation cannot change a person’s identity, but it will change their access to health care. Medical schools need to teach this, and we as students want to learn. Future doctors like me are watching everything that is happening, and we are worried.
When students apply to medical school, the number one question they are asked is, “Why medicine?” While the answer to this question can take many different forms, the bottom line is pretty simple: We want to help people. Medical schools can make a monumental difference in how future doctors navigate this political environment and provide care to patients. We urge medical schools to keep teaching us how to do that for all patients.

The stories from Nebraskans are needed to complete a two-year research project about this lesser-known chapter of state history.
“The goal is to increase awareness about Nebraska’s Green Book sites, Black history throughout the state, and reasons to preserve and celebrate it,” said Jade Mendoza, survey coordinator in the State Historic Preservation Office, a division of the Nebraska State Historical Society.
The Historical Society is collaborating with the Durham Museum, Great Plains Black History Museum and the Making Invisible Histories Visible program developed by Omaha Public Schools to seek Nebraskans’ stories associated with Black American travel during the 1950s and 1960s.
The Green Book was published during the Jim Crow segregationist era by Victor Hugo Green, a New York City mailman, to help Black American and international travelers find safe lodging, restaurants, gas stations and other businesses throughout North America.
Publication of the Green Book lasted until 1967, and since then, many Green Book sites have been lost.
“We need Nebraskans’ memories and stories about Black American travel in the state to help us tell this lesser-known Nebraska history,” Mendoza said.
Those with memories of visiting Green Book sites in Nebraska or those who recall stories told by older relatives, can email information to jade.mendoza@nebraska.gov or call 402-429-7465.
Stories also can be submitted using the State Historical Society website at https://history.nebraska.gov/historic-preservation/nebraska-green-book/share-to-nebraska-green-book-project.
Mendoza said that once research and site visits are completed, two Green Book sites will be nominated in Nebraska to be placed on the National Register of Historic Places.
The Nebraska State Historic Preservation Office uses historic survey work like this to recognize historic places, understand potential impacts to historic places and to unlock access to preservation-based economic development programs.

(Helaina Thompson/Courtesy of Over the Moon Farm)Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
 A mixed response from states

The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.

[&#8230;]","The Lincoln Walks at Midnight Statue sits in front of the West Virginia state Capitol building in Charleston, W.Va. (Lexi Browning | West Virginia Watch)Lawmakers are considering dismantling the state’s Office of Equal Opportunity for the sake of “government efficiency.” But the office, which works to protect West Virginians from discrimination, appears to already be gone.
The Senate approved a three-sentence bill March 29 that would repeal a section of state code mandating the state’s Office of Equal Opportunity. The work — including complying with federal disability rights and anti-discrimination laws — is already being carried out by the state’s Division of Personnel, according to bill sponsor, Sen. Patricia Rucker, R-Jefferson.
It wasn’t until the members of the House Committee on Government Organization vetted the bill Thursday that it was revealed the office was already likely disbanded, possibly violating state code by not having lawmakers’ required approval.
A website for the office is now offline. State code requires that the Office of Equal Opportunity have a coordinator;  the office’s two employees have been moved elsewhere in state government. 
  Del. Jonathan Kyle, R-Randolph
Sheryl Webb, director of the Division of Personnel, declined to tell House committee members who had directed the division to begin dismantling the office, saying she was fulfilling what had been requested. When Del. Jonathan Kyle, R-Randolph, pressed for an answer, Webb didn’t respond.
Kyle responded, “You don’t throw anybody under the bus, I understand. But this is where we are in state government, with people doing whatever they want to do, and that’s, frankly, unacceptable.”
A spokesperson for Gov. Patrick Morrisey did not respond to a question about whether the governor had directed the change. 
  Del. Tristan Leavitt, R-Kanahwa
On Friday, Del. Tristan Leavitt, R-Kanahwa, who serves on the House Government Organization Committee, said that further research led him to believe that nothing was done in violation of state code.
“This office continues to be in place, the duties continue to be performed within the Division of Personnel,” Leavitt said.
“The substantive work that that office does, which is really important work, all of that is still moving forward in a way that’s in compliance. So, for me, that’s very reassuring to know,” Leavitt said. 
Kyle said on Friday that he believed that the situation in committee was a misunderstanding and concurred with Leavitt’s comments. 
  Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha
Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha, who is also on the committee, said she still thinks that administrators “moved those functionalities around illegally.”
“They can’t just dismantle an office that requires the Legislature,” she said. “During the presentation, they mentioned that, ‘They’ told us to go ahead and move everything.’ We couldn’t get a clear cut answer, whether that was the secretary of administration, or whether that was the governor’s office themselves.” 
Robert Paulson, general counsel for the Department of Administration, maintained that the Office of Equal Opportunity is “not eliminated” with others performing those duties. He told lawmakers that the department is in the process of naming a coordinator. He wasn’t sure who made the call to make the changes.
Rucker said she wasn’t aware of the changes to the Office of Equal Opportunity.
Morrisey targets government efficiency 
Webb said the change was partially spurred by Morrisey’s executive order mandating that government agencies find efficiencies and eliminate waste. Eliminating the Office of Equal Opportunity would save $125,000 in salaries plus $41,250 in benefits, she said.
“We were reviewing how to create efficiencies, this was one of the things that was looked at because of the duplicative nature and the additional cost to it,” Webb said. 
Young said it was also likely a result of Morrisey’s ban on diversity, equity and inclusion practices and policies in state government.
Lawmakers created the Office of Equal Opportunity in 2022. 
A report from the state’s Office of the Legislative Auditor earlier this year said that the office was “needed to facilitate compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws and to minimize liability costs to the state from violations of such laws.”
“However, further progress is needed in developing a statewide and uniform program,” the report said. 
Despite questions about how the office was eliminated, both Young and Leavitt believed that the state could carry out its functions of complying with federal laws and protecting West Virginians from discrimination. The Division of Personnel already offers equal rights education courses and training to state agencies, according to Webb.
“They’re important laws, and I think both the testimony we heard in committee and everything I’ve learned since indicates that they are prioritizing those and doing everything they can to encourage the entire state government to be aware of the law and to comply with it as fully as possible,” Leavitt said. 
Young emphasized that state code mandates that West Virginia have this office until lawmakers approve changes. 
“It is very concerning and definitely does not follow state code,” she said. “I do believe it will probably be debated on the floor, because we still have a lot of questions.”
The legislative session adjourns April 12.

National Heritage Areas are “lived-in landscapes” that are “representative of the national experience through the physical features that remain and the traditions that have evolved in them,” as defined by the Park Service.
The Great Dismal Swamp is an environmental and cultural treasure, home to dozens of species of animals and, at one time, groups of Native Americans and formerly enslaved people who used it as a pathway to freedom.
The important details of where the conceptual boundary of the Great Dismal Swamp’s National Heritage Area would lie and who would manage any conservation, recreation and education opportunities remain unanswered questions at the moment.
Sometime in 2026, the Park Service plans to submit a feasibility study to Congress that will answer those questions. Congress will have the final say on whether the region is suited for the federal designation.
There are currently 62 designated National Heritage Areas in 36 states and territories. The unique federal designation does not result in any land transfers, local zoning changes or easements.

The entire state of Tennessee is a designated National Heritage Area, and the rights of landowners are not affected by the designation.
“A lot of people fear government overreach…” said John Warren, Communications Specialist at the National Park Service Northeast Region.
“There’s no such federal footprint in a National Heritage Area. It is entirely something that the local community takes on and runs itself.”
Any federal funding for the proposed National Heritage Area would come by way of congressional appropriation.
“A lot of those National Heritage Areas may receive up to $1 million annually, but others get a lot less,” said Warren. National Heritage Areas must receive matching funds from non-federal sources as well.
The role of the National Park Service is to be a partner and advisor to the actual manager of the Heritage Area, called the “local coordinating entity,” an organization within the community chosen to interpret the history and traditions of the area and manage the conservation, recreation and education goals laid out by the project.
Creating a National Heritage Area
During virtual meetings held last week, members of the public shared their ideas on the Great Dismal Swamp National Heritage Area’s potential location, its coordinating entity, and the natural, cultural and historic resources the region has to offer.

The public was also asked if opportunities exist for improving the quality of those resources through conservation, recreation and education. Comments are encouraged to be submitted in writing online, by mail or over the phone until May 19.
The public comments are not meant to be a vote, said Warren, but “a way to collect information.”
“The study has 10 criteria, and the answer to all of these has got to be ‘yes’ for us to be able to give a favorable conclusion that, yes, this qualifies as a National Heritage Area,” said Warren. “So it’s a high bar.”
Warren said that anecdotally, over the last ten years only about half of the National Heritage Areas that were applied for ended up receiving the designation from Congress.
As part of the study, the National Park Service staff has also spoken with potential state and local partners as well as possible coordinating entities. Chesapeake City Council has voiced interest in assuming the managing role, said Julie Bell, cultural resource project manager for the Park Service.
Nonprofits, universities, and state and local governments are some examples of coordinating entities that were chosen to manage other Heritage Areas around the nation. Any entity outside of the federal government is allowed to assume the role, including Indigenous tribes, said Bell.
The Great Dismal Swamp National Heritage Area will involve coordination across state lines since the Virginia-North Carolina border slices directly through the swamp.
In 2003, the Northern Neck National Heritage Area was established along with six others around the nation. The designation was Virginia’s third National Heritage Area to date.
Two other possible National Heritage Areas have completed their feasibility studies and are currently awaiting a decision from Congress: the Finger Lakes Region in New York and the Kentucky Wildlands.
The story of the swamp

The National Park Service is developing themes that are present in the Great Dismal Swamp region to tell a nationally distinctive heritage story. One theme is “a place of refuge” and another is “a field of conflict.”
Based on artifacts found in the Great Dismal Swamp dating back over 5,000 years, the Nansemond, Meherrin, Yeopim and Lumbee people were likely stewards of the swamp long before European colonists arrived, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
After colonization, the role of the swamp for local communities changed. About 50,000 self-emancipated African Americans, called maroons, along with free Blacks, Indigenous people and Europeans lived in the swamp in search of refuge.
Some used it as a pause point on their journeys north, making the swamp an official water-based rest stop on the Underground Railroad, but others settled permanent communities there up until the end of the Civil War.
Today, the Great Dismal Swamp is protected by a 113,000 acre National Wildlife Refuge managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service. What is now a vast, uninhabited landscape is actually just a remnant of its former self.
The once enormous swamp covered over 1 million acres, roughly the size of Delaware, but was drained over the years, first by a young George Washington in 1763.
Washington and other investors initially aimed to create land in the swamp that could be sold for profit, then to dig a canal to transport goods across the swamp. Enslaved people were forced to provide the labor for these early economic ventures.
One of the most successful business opportunities in the swamp turned out to be logging. The now globally rare Atlantic white cedar was in high demand, and gaining access to the trees required digging ditches to drain the swamp. By the 1950s, the last of the virgin timber in the Great Dismal Swamp was gone, according to a National Park Service story map.
The future of the swamp
On George Washington’s birthday in 1973, about 50,000 acres of swamp land was donated to the Nature Conservancy and then handed over to the Fish & Wildlife Service, thus creating the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge.
“We have discovered that swamps actually play a vital role in our environment and that they are necessary,” said Warren. “You know, they’re not just places that we want to avoid because they have a lot of mosquitos or something like that. They’re places that are useful to the environment.”
The Fish and Wildlife Service says the swamp serves as a permanent and migratory home for roughly 50 species of mammals, 200 types of birds and 100 species of butterflies. The diverse ecosystem ranges from bald cypress to red maple and Virginia’s last historic refuge of native Atlantic white cedar.
In addition to the habitat the swamp provides to wildlife, it also prevents floods and improves water quality in nearby communities with a combined population of nearly 1 million people, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service.
A 2017 project to re-moisten the peat soils of the swamp served to benefit the surrounding population, including in Suffolk, by restoring a more natural water regime in the area. The Fish and Wildlife Service and its partners installed adjustable dams in key places to regulate the amount of water leaving the swamp, improving the environment’s ability to provide its once inherent benefits.
The re-moistened peat is now able to absorb stormwater more efficiently, acting like a sponge to reduce flooding during severe weather such as the storms and hurricanes that are common in the region. Healthy peat also stores more carbon, a valuable tool in combating global climate change.
“This is a region that has already changed a lot,” said Warren. Creating a National Heritage Area “may have some influence on that, or it may not.” Those decisions would be left to the local community and the chosen coordinating entity.

During the summer of 2024, countless transgender and gender expansive patients expressed to me fears about what might happen to their access to gender affirming medical care if a conservative administration were to win the White House. This worst-case scenario became reality in the first weeks of 2025, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order redefining legal gender identity as a strict binary of male and female — effectively erasing recognition of nonbinary and transgender individuals and interrupting federal funding to institutions providing gender-affirming health care.
As a transgender health program intern, I have seen providers try to reassure patients of their well-being and safety while they themselves fear how their job will be affected if the laws would drastically alter the way we practice medicine.
As a gay man about to enter the medical profession, I am afraid. The recent wave of anti-trans initiatives pushed by this administration is part of a much broader effort to dismantle diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging programs across the country under the guise of “restoring meritocracy” and “leveling the playing field.”
But in health care, the playing field has never been level. Minority populations continue to face disproportionate health risks and barriers to care.
DEIB is the foundation of medical education. It teaches future physicians how to address these disparities and combat the structural inequities that put vulnerable patients at risk. Studies show medical students have felt unprepared to manage transgender and gender expansive patients upon graduation. One study even claimed that only 27% of students were confident in their knowledge of the health needs of transgender patients.
Beyond that, they could not correctly answer questions about race-related medical history despite affirming that understanding historical context is important in medicine. This lack of education was always a problem, and efforts were underway to solve it. Eliminating DEIB would not only erode this progress but set us back behind where we were even before we started.
In 2020, the American Association of Medical Colleges rolled out the Structural Competency Curriculum, which aims to train providers “to recognize and respond to the impact of upstream, structural factors on patient health and health care.” Since then, medical schools across the country have adopted the values of this curriculum and incorporated it throughout the course of their students’ training. Health equity is a core pillar of medical students’ professional development and should be embedded into the culture of patient-centric care.
When DEIB is dismantled, programs like these disappear, and awareness of health disparities among marginalized patient populations fades from the culture of those whose job is to provide the proper care and treatment.
If physicians are not trained on specific health risks that directly impact transgender patients, how can we provide adequate care? If we are not taught about racial health disparities, how will we work to combat them? If we stop prioritizing inclusion, how can we ensure equal health care for all?
Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity. Legislation cannot change a person’s identity, but it will change their access to health care. Medical schools need to teach this, and we as students want to learn. Future doctors like me are watching everything that is happening, and we are worried. When students apply to medical school, the number one question they are asked is, “Why medicine?” While the answer to this question can take many different forms, the bottom line is pretty simple: We want to help people.
Medical schools can make a monumental difference in how future doctors navigate this political environment and provide care to patients. We urge medical schools to keep teaching us how to do that for all patients.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderThe 2025 legislative session ended abruptly Friday when the Senate suddenly adjourned earlier than usual, catching many people in the bustling Georgia Capitol off guard and throwing the House into disarray.

The last day of the 40-day legislative session, when the House and Senate usually crank out legislation right up until midnight and celebrate at the end of the night by throwing torn-up pieces of paper into the air, ended with a whimper. 
Lt. Gov. Burt Jones sent senators home a little after 9 p.m. Friday. Senators seemed to be taken off-guard – the floor of the chamber was littered not with the customary shreds of paper but entire crumpled up sheets.
“We’d already gotten all our priorities done, and I’ve been saying all day, of course, I’ve been leading up to the last two days saying we’re going to adjourn early,” Jones told reporters after the Senate gaveled out. “I actually was trying to get done earlier than now, but there were a few more priorities that we went ahead and got some ‘agrees’ on and everything, but it was a good session, and we got a lot of things done.”
Not all of Jones’ top priorities were successful, including the Red Tape Rollback Act, also known as Georgia’s DOGE, aimed at cutting government bureaucracy.

The abrupt ending to Senate business seemed to surprise House lawmakers. After a break, the chamber gaveled back in to pass a few more bills and resume the ceremonial thank-yous to House staff and the throwing of the paper scraps.
Speaking to reporters after the final gavel, Newington Republican and House Speaker Jon Burns said the House had accomplished what it had set out to, with the exception of efforts to rein in the use of school zone speed cameras. 
Dozens of bills were left in limbo Friday but will still be active when lawmakers return for the second half of the biennium next January. 
Burns also lobbed a jab at the other chamber.

“I just think it shows that the House is focusing on its priorities and getting the job done, and we’re not worried about moving on to some kind of higher office. We came here to do a job and we did our job, and that’s what drives the House,” Burns said. 
Jones is widely expected to announce a run for governor in 2026, and other high-ranking senators are reportedly mulling runs for other top positions like lieutenant governor and attorney general. At least one senator, McDonough Republican Sen. Brian Strickland, who is running for attorney general, has filed his papers to run for statewide office. 
Friday night was a peculiar end to a session that had been dominated by debate over new limits on lawsuits, a slate of culture war bills largely focused on transgender Georgians and efforts to improve security on Georgia’s campuses after last year’s Apalachee High School shooting that left two students and two teachers dead. 
Lawmakers pass next year’s budget amid economic uncertainty 
  Gov. Brian Kemp. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Lawmakers passed a budget for the next budget year on the final day of this year’s legislative session as economic uncertainty looms on the national level.
The $37.8 million budget notably includes spending boosts for the state’s prisons and schools, and it’s slightly larger than the one Gov. Brian Kemp unveiled when the legislation session began. The governor, who sets the spending level, added $50.4 million to next year’s revenue estimate Friday.
The budget, which takes effect July 1, was sent to the governor as the Trump administration’s historic tariffs upset the global economy and as economic forecasters say the U.S. economy could be heading toward a recession.
The S&P 500 has dropped 10% over two days after Trump unveiled his tariff plan.
“Our budget is predicated on a revenue estimate, and I think it’s fair to say that since we reconvened in January, the macro-economic picture has changed pretty dramatically in just over the last few days,” Rep. Scott Holcomb, an Atlanta Democrat, said to the House’s top budget writer, Rep. Matt Hatchett.
  Rep. Matt Hatchett Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“How comfortable are you with the probability that the revenue estimates that make this budget will hold throughout the year?” Holcomb said.
Hatchett, a Dublin Republican, responded that if there are “huge swings” then lawmakers would likely need to return to Atlanta for a special session to adjust the spending plan.
But Hatchett and other House Republican leaders told reporters later that they do not think that is likely.
“Certainly, a good businessperson is always looking forward and trying to be ready for what’s coming next,” Burns said. “If we don’t do that, then we’re not doing our job. So, we’re conscious of those possibilities, and we’re in a very, very strong position when it comes to reserves.”
Hatchett said Friday that the state has over $12 billion in reserves. Although he said he thinks it’s unlikely that lawmakers will need to be summoned back later this year, he said he thinks a “correction” could be on the horizon.
Lawmakers pass bipartisan landlord bill 
  Rep. Mary Margaret Oliver. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
A bipartisan bill intended to hold out-of-state landlords more accountable for managing single-family homes across Georgia is awaiting the governor’s signature.
Decatur Democratic Rep. Mary Margaret Oliver, who is the sponsor of House Bill 399, called the measure a good first step to deal with investor-owned homes that are popping up all over metro Atlanta. Under the legislation, landlords with single-family homes or duplexes have to hire Georgia brokers or other in-state management to handle tenant maintenance and other housing issues. 
Both chambers passed the bill before this year’s session ended late Friday, with the Senate passing it with a 46-9 vote. 
Advocates for housing rights point to the significant economic hit caused by fewer single-family homes available for first-time buyers.
“We know that the local property owners, the local property managements, are struggling with this competition that’s coming from the hedge funds, the out-of-state investors who are impacting our market in a bad way,” Oliver said following Friday’s Senate vote on her bill.
Oliver’s bill was carried in the Senate by Sylvania Republican Sen. Max Burns, who said the problem is more widespread than Atlanta.
“It’s an issue in our smaller, urban areas as well as our metropolitan areas,” Burns said. “It’ll impact rural Georgia when it gets down to Bulloch County, Statesboro, Valdosta or Macon. You’re not seeing it just in Metro. If you look at the districts where there’s more than 25% of available rental housing owned by investors, that creates a challenge.”
Many bills left lingering

The first year of the two-year legislative session concluded without the final passage of one of Jones’ top priorities, a so-called red tape rollback bill as coined by Jones to be a state-level version of the Elon Musk-led federal Department of Government Efficiency.
Senate Bill 28, which cleared the chamber in February by a 33-21 vote that fell along party lines, failed to make it to the House floor for debate Friday. This is the second year Jones’ red tape rollback had not made it out of the House. 
The most significant GOP election bill for the session also failed to get a final vote Friday in the House. 
The House adjourned before legislators were presented with a substitute version of House Bill 397 that cleared the Senate after the addition of several proposals such as expanding State Election Board powers and banning Georgia from being a member of multi-state voter rolls sharing databases. Instead, the House passed a resolution Friday creating a study committee that will examine election rules later this year. 
A pair of firearm-related bills were also left unfinished. The House had spent more than an hour Friday debating a proposal that targets a Savannah ordinance penalizing gun owners who leave their firearms in unlocked vehicles. Under the proposal, someone facing a fine would be able to sue the city for as much as $25,000 in damages.

And a House proposal that originally aimed to encourage safe gun storage through an income tax credit stalled after a compromise version limited the tax credit to gun safety training and spliced it with a Senate bill creating a four-day sales tax holiday for firearms, ammunition and other accessories, like scopes and magazines – as well as gun safes.
This year, lawmakers passed a ban on transgender athletes in girls’ sports and signed off on another bill seeking to block inmates from receiving gender-affirming care. This also proved to be the year that legislators passed a so-called religious freedom bill, which Kemp signed Friday over concerns that it would lead to discrimination against LGBTQ people and religious minorities. 
But other controversial red meat bills were left behind for now, including a ban on diversity, equity and inclusion programs or policies from all state public schools and universities. Other stalled measures would have banned gender-affirming care for state workers and made it harder for minors to be treated with puberty blockers for gender dysphoria.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderThe Georgia Senate approved a bill Friday that allows criminal defendants to recoup their legal costs if the prosecuting attorney in their case is disqualified for personal or professional misconduct, a description that recalls the Fulton County prosecutor who brought felony charges against President Donald Trump.
Next stop is Gov. Brian Kemp’s desk for a signature.
Senate Bill 244, originally inspired by Trump’s election interference case in Georgia, was later amended to revive the Wrongful Conviction Compensation Act, a stalled House bill that was aimed at providing reparations to people wrongfully incarcerated.
House lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have faced an uphill battle in their efforts to properly compensate those who have been wrongfully incarcerated. The process is currently done on a case-by-case basis through individual compensation resolutions that must pass through the full legislative process like any other bill. Legislation to standardize the process was initially introduced by Atlanta Democratic Rep. Scott Holcomb in 2022, and re-introduced in 2023, but his efforts have repeatedly been stalled in the Senate by Republican opposition. 
The version that ultimately emerged as the clock ran out on the 2025 legislative session Friday, sponsored by Alpharetta Republican Sen. Brandon Beach, secured a 35-18 vote in its second pass through the Senate, with all Republicans and the three highest-ranking Senate Democrats voting in support of the legislation. Its passage also marked a final sine die gavel for Beach, a staunch Trump ally who was recently appointed by the president to serve as U.S. Treasurer.
If Gov. Brian Kemp signs the bill into law, it will allow criminal defendants to recoup their legal costs from county prosecuting attorneys’ budgets in cases where the prosecutor is disqualified for personal or professional misconduct. (During Trump’s election interference case in Georgia, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis was disqualified after an appeals court judge found that her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a “significant appearance of impropriety.”)
Separately, it will establish a new process under Georgia state law for people who have been convicted for crimes they did not commit and later exonerated, allowing administrative law judges to rule on wrongful conviction compensation cases and awarding a standardized rate of $75,000 for each year of incarceration to each exoneree, with an additional $25,000 added for each year spent on death row.
This is the third consecutive biennium that legislators in the House have attempted to reform the system for compensating those who have been wrongfully incarcerated. However, Republican opposition in the Senate — particularly from Sen. Randy Robertson, a Cataula Republican and former law enforcement officer — has repeatedly stalled those efforts. Under current Georgia law, those who have been wrongfully convicted must find a state representative who is willing to sponsor an individual compensation resolution for them and file a claim with Georgia’s Claims Advisory Board. Those resolutions then go through the full legislative process and must pass committees and floor votes in both the House and Senate before they can take effect, but those efforts too have routinely died in the Senate in recent years.
Though Robertson emphasized that he was still not fully on board with the legislation aimed at compensating the wrongfully convicted, he conceded that the current system was in need of reform in a speech on the final day of the 2025 legislative session.
“What I realized is the process is not a good process,” Robertson said, but vowed to continue workshopping the wrongful conviction component of the bill after the 2025 legislative session concludes.
“I’m going to ask you today to support the senator from the 21st and vote for this legislation, and in the off-season, we’ll tackle the other thing that’s attached to it and we’ll come up with a process that works,” he continued, addressing his Senate colleagues. “Support this bill, get it across, and I promise you the fight’s not over.”
Democrats also condemned the original language of the bill, arguing that it could have a disproportionate impact on smaller counties with more limited budgets, and discourage prosecutors from tackling complex or high-profile cases.
But Holcomb celebrated its passage.
“This will give hope to real people whose lives were devastated and destroyed by a wrongful conviction, and it gives them a path to get some measure of compensation so they can restart their lives,” he said. “I’m very grateful for that. This is a major legislative achievement that comes out of this session.”
Though he acknowledged that there is no way to fully undo a wrongful conviction, he hopes that the new system will bring equality and efficiency to the process.
“There isn’t a person alive who would trade the money that these individuals are receiving for what happened to them in terms of being locked up in our state’s prisons, for usually for decades of their lives for something that they didn’t do,” he said. “This is a path to provide some remedy. It’s an inadequate remedy in terms of nothing can bring back those years, but it’s an adequate remedy in terms of dollars that will really help them through the remaining years of their lives.”

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)House and Senate fiscal leaders reached final agreement Friday on a compromise budget that includes $1.6 billion in annual taxes and ends a one-year experiment with a racing authority tasked with modernizing a storied racetrack and preserving an industry.
The deal reached Friday on a $67 billion total budget comes after two days of negotiations that were less tense than in recent years. The House and Senate each must now vote one final time to approve the deal that is contained in two companion budget bills.
“We made sure our core programs are solid and funded. In the process, we’ve been grownups — a big difference, I think from what you see at the federal level,” said House Appropriations Chair Del. Ben Barnes (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel). We know we had to take cuts, and we took about $2 billion in cuts, but we also raised revenues to make sure our core values are protected and funded.”
The overall budget — a figure that includes all state, federal and special revenues — will grow by a little more than 1%. Maryland’s General Fund budget, the smaller portion funded by direct taxes to state residents, decreases by more than $400 million.
Final House and Senate votes could come as early as Saturday. Republicans, who make up the minority of the House and Senate, are expected to oppose the plan but cannot, on their own, prevent Democrats from passing it.
Federal budget actions are triggering
Concerns remain about the potential harm from rampant federal budget cuts and layoffs. The final legislative plan includes a trigger provision that requires a report to lawmakers from the Department of Budget and Management if cuts to federal aid to the state or other reductions reach $1 billion.
“The idea simply is, as we move forward when things may be happening to us from Washington, we’ll be getting prepared and ready to be having discussions and understanding exactly all the impacts,” said Senate Budget and Taxation Chair Sen. Guy Guzzone (D-Howard) to reporters Friday afternoon.
A separate set of trigger provisions remains under negotiation as part of an effort to tame some cost of the state’s Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reforms.
Cuts, taxes, shifts
Lawmakers and Gov. Wes Moore (D) began the session facing a $3 billion structural deficit.
Moore’s budget as introduced included $2 billion in cuts. Some of those were related to vacant positions. Others merely shifted costs the state paid to local governments. Those shifts included teacher pensions and the costs of property assessments.
Another, added by the legislature, requires local jurisdictions to pick up 50% of any settlement in a case where someone was erroneously convicted.
Other administration cuts to programs, including those for persons with developmental disabilities, were restored by lawmakers — although the ever-shifting budget picture saw Moore this week impose a new $28.8 million in cuts for developmental disability services.
Tech tax tweaks
Among the biggest changes is a new sales tax on information technology and data services. The 3% tech tax is expected to raise nearly $500 million for the state.
On Friday, House and Senate fiscal leaders made several tweaks to the plan.

One amendment made it clear that affiliated companies would not be subject to the tax — a concern some opponents said could exponentially increase costs.
“It was never the intent that that would occur,” said Barnes, adding that the “scoring,” or potential revenue realized from the tax did not include that specific situation.
Another excluded companies in “emerging technology development areas,” specifically the “Discovery District” in College Park. The change exempts companies such as IonQ and companies that do business with a developer of quantum computing technology from the services sales tax. Moore has made the development of quantum computing and other technologies a focal point of his efforts to diversify the state’s economy.
“It certainly matters that it’s the governor’s priority, but it’s all our priority,” Guzzone said.
The changes do not address concerns that the tax would either bankrupt some companies doing federal subcontracting work or force them to move out of Maryland to avoid the tax.
Del. Brian Crosby (D-St. Mary’s), vice chair of the House Economic Matters Committee, said last month that he moved his IT business out of the state rather than lose his company.
House Ways and Means Chair Del. Vanessa Atterbeary (D-Howard) said the change would not affect how the tax is applied to businesses similar to Crosby’s.
The state will also add a 6% sales tax to vending machine purchases.
Lawmakers recast Moore’s tax modernization proposal
Moore’s spending plan included a proposal he said would modernize the state’s income tax system. Under his plan, he created two new tax brackets for high earners beginning at $500,000. The new brackets are expected to generate nearly $344 million annually in new revenue for the state.
The proposal also included a 2% surcharge on capital gains over $350,000. That tax, which would be split between the general fund and the Transportation Trust Fund, is expected to bring in nearly $370 million annually.
As part of the income tax revisions, 94% of Maryland taxpayers will see either no increase or some reduction in their income taxes. The average reduction is expected to be between $50 and $65 annually.
The budget includes a 20% increase in the standard deduction — much lower than the doubling Moore proposed.
Moore also proposed eliminating itemized deductions. The legislature rejected that idea and instead opted for a plan that slowly phases out itemized deductions at $200,000 of taxable income.
The General Assembly also rejected Moore’s proposal to repeal the state inheritance tax. The governor planned to pay for the change with a broader application of the estate tax. Maryland is the only state with both an inheritance and an estate tax.
The compromise agreement also increases the maximum piggyback income tax rate for local governments to 3.3%. The current maximum is 3.2%.
Also increasing are taxes on sports betting and cannabis. The budget includes increasing the tax on sports betting operations in Maryland from 15% to 20%.
The sales tax on recreational cannabis will jump from the current 9% — equal to that assessed on alcohol products — to 15% in July.
Moore’s plan to lower corporate income taxes also died Friday.
The governor proposed lowering the current rate of 8.25% to 7.99%. The reduction was pegged to a requirement to pass combined corporate tax reporting and have it phased in over two years.
The House, in its amended budget plan, added combined reporting but crossed out the corporate tax reduction. The Senate took the House version and nixed combined reporting.
In the end, the two sides agreed to kill both parts of the proposal, leaving the state exactly where it is today.
Racetrack Authority put out to pasture
Lawmakers also agreed to a plan to eliminate the Maryland Thoroughbred Racetrack Operating Authority. The panel was created in 2023. Last year, it consummated a deal with the owners of Pimlico to effectively take over the racecourse, the Preakness Stakes and thoroughbred racing in the state.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Atterbeary said lawmakers “wanted some more oversight and to be able to know and understand what’s going on in real time, which wasn’t happening.”
The budget package eliminates the racetrack authority. In its place, lawmakers will task the Maryland Stadium Authority with overseeing the new training facility and a rebuilt Pimlico Race Track.
Atterbeary said she does not believe the changes made in the budget will delay the work of modernizing Pimlico.
Cash infusion for Transportation Trust Fund
The plan also attempts to bolster the state’s flagging Transportation Trust Fund — a pot of money used to pay for the state’s roads, highways and transit projects.
The two sides had agreed roughly on a target figure of around $400 million annually. They differed on how to get there.
In the end, the House and Senate agreed to a menu of revenues that is estimated to general more than $2.3 billion over five years beginning July 1. That includes an estimated $500 million in fiscal 2026.
Nearly a quarter of that revenue will come from a portion of the new capital gains surcharge. Another $520 million comes from an increase in the costs of titling a vehicle in Maryland.
The two sides also compromised on an increase in the sales tax on a car purchase starting in July. The House initially proposed increasing the tax from 6% to 6.8%. The Senate amended that plan with a tax that phased in over two years to a maximum of 6.5%.
In the end, the two sides landed on a 6.5% sales tax on cars with no phase-in period.
The state will also add a new 3.5% excise tax on rental vehicles. That tax is expected to bring in $240 million.
The state will also pick up $52 million by accelerating the phase-in of higher vehicle registration fees passed last year.
Another $150 million over five years will come from increasing the fees for the state’s Vehicle Emissions Inspection Program. The test, which currently costs $14, will soon cost $30. Late fees face a similar increase.
Republican victory erased in compromise
The House also agreed to accept a Senate plan to add a $5 per tire fee — nearly $110 million over five years— for the trust fund. Republicans in the Senate scored a victory this week in the form of an amendment that earmarked the money for roads and highways.
That victory was short-lived as the Senate gave up the earmark as part of negotiations.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA proposed last-minute attempt to limit the public’s access to police reports and communications with state lawmakers was abandoned Friday as quickly as it emerged.
The proposed changes to the state’s open records law had popped up unexpectedly Wednesday in the gatekeeping House Rules Committee, bypassing the usual legislative committee process.
Rep. Rob Leverett, an Elberton Republican, said he had seen the proposed changes as just “extensions of existing law and were not really reflecting any new policy.” 
But the proposal, Senate Bill 12, was immediately met with opposition from First Amendment advocates who warned the changes would weaken transparency laws.
Under the proposal, police departments would be able to shield almost all information about officers’ stops, arrests and incident responses. And it would have created broad new exemptions to prevent public disclosure of the General Assembly’s activities, including communication with other parts of state government
The change narrowing what police records are available for public inspection appeared to be in response to a lawsuit filed by the Appen Media Group against Sandy Springs that accused the city of withholding public police reports. The state Court of Appeals had recently ruled in Appen’s favor.
Gov. Brian Kemp also seemed cool to the proposal Friday.
“I haven’t seen what the Legislature has done other than just reading a blip in the paper about it,” Kemp told reporters. “But we’ll look at the legislation today. We’ll see what ends up passing or not passing. But I think the General Assembly knows that I’m a pretty transparent person, as you can see being out here answering your questions today.” 
The House ultimately retreated from the changes Friday and passed a version that was more in line with the original proposal – to the relief of the bill’s sponsor, Danielsville Republican Sen. Frank Ginn.
“You don’t want to get into an argument with people that buy ink by the train car load,” Ginn said, referring to concerns from newspapers and others.
Ginn said he was trying to pass a “pro-business bill.” His proposal came in response to a Georgia Supreme Court ruling last year that unanimously found that a private contractor working for a public entity is still subject to the law and can be sent requests for public records they may possess. 
Senate Bill 12 said that requests for those public records should go through the local governmental agencies that contracted with those third parties. This version is what now sits on the governor’s desk.

In a press release sent April 4, the party&#8217;s executive committee announced it had censured [&#8230;]","Senator-elect Josh Kassmier, a former House representative from Fort Benton, at a Senate Republican caucus meeting on Nov. 12, 2024. (Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)The Montana Republican Party has censured nine state senators and will no longer consider them to be Republicans — but the senators say they hold firm to the conservative mantle and the party should not insert itself into legislative business.
In a press release sent April 4, the party’s executive committee announced it had censured the nine senators for their “repeated alignment with Senate Democrats” this legislative session and for “undermining Republican priorities and leadership.”
The censure calls out the nine’s “unprecedented alliance” with Senate Democrats as a “coordinated scheme” to undermine the GOP leadership, including alleging ethical violations by Senate President Matt Regier, found to be unsubstantiated by the Legislative Auditor.
The committee unanimously voted for the censure on March 27 to the surprise Friday of at least four of the nine.
“I’m dumbfounded,” said Sen. Russ Tempel, R-Chester. “I’ve been a Republican longer than ( state GOP Executive Director Tyler) Newcombe’s been alive.” 
In an extensive letter to the head of the state GOP, obtained by the Daily Montanan, Sen. Josh Kassmier, R-Fort Benton, said his responsibility is to the people of Montana, “not party bosses like you.”
The letter was an attempt to argue against the potential censure, and Kassmier emailed it to GOP Chairman Don Kaltschmidt on March 27.
However, Kassmier said he learned Friday that Kaltschmidt did not receive the letter; Newcombe also said neither he nor Kaltschmidt have seen the letter, but they made attempts to meet with the nine.
None of the nine showed up to the executive committee meeting on March 27; several cited conflicts while others said they had never received invitations. 
In the letter, Kassmier said he is a conservative who supports the agenda of Republican President Donald Trump. Kassmier also accuses Senate President Regier, R-Kalispell, of “playing political games” to undermine Gov. Greg Gianforte’s agenda and of working with Democrats.
“I support the conservative tax plans endorsed by Gov. Gianforte. I oppose the liberal tax plans pushed by President Regier,” the letter said. “ … The governor’s tax plans are consistent with the Montana Republican Party Platform. The tax plans pushed by President Regier are not.”
Regier said Friday he had not seen the letter. However he responded to the censure of the senators by saying it was basically an acknowledgement of the status quo in the Senate. 
“It’s been a very frustrating session for Republicans from the first day,” Regier said. 
The division between Senate Republicans began at the start of the 69th Legislature, when the nine — Kassmier, Tempel, Jason Ellsworth, Wendy McKamey, Gayle Lammers, Butch Gillespie, Gregg Hunter, Denley Loge, and Shelley Vance — joined all Democrats to change the chamber’s rules, going against GOP leadership.
That coalition, in essence a working majority, has repeatedly flexed its muscles over the last three months to pass big pieces of legislation, change committees and at times effectively run the Senate floor, as well as block attempts to expel one of their members, Ellsworth, for ethics violations. Ellsworth has since been censured by the Senate.
Previously, the state GOP executive committee issued a statement “strongly rebuking” the senators, saying additional steps would follow if the group did not stop its actions against the party.

“Despite multiple calls for unity and adherence to Republican principles, the senators have chosen to align with Democrats, undermining Republican priorities and leadership,” the statement about the censure said. “…These Senators have undermined the Republican majority leadership and disregarded the will of Montana Republican voters.”
The executive board also voted to withhold any political funding for the nine in future elections and said the nine shouldn’t be considered to speak for the party. 
Sen. Hunter, however, said his duty is to his constituents.
“The GOP central committee didn’t elect me,” Hunter said. “I don’t know what they’re using as a litmus test or not, but if you look at the Montana conservative scorecard, I’m more conservative than most Republicans.”
Sen. Wendy McKamey, R-Great Falls, said she’s “as Republican as they come,” and the state GOP was mischaracterizing the senators’ actions. 
“We aren’t voting with the Democrats. The Democrats are voting with us to support the governor — not doing what other Republicans are doing to fight the governor,” McKamey said. “We’re doing the kinds of things good Republicans do.”
McKamey also said she was recently notified that she is receiving an award from the Republican National Committee for her conservatism.
In his letter, Kassmier wrote that his “strong conservative values” helped him defeat state GOP Vice Chairperson Lola Sheldon-Galloway in the 2024 primary for his Senate seat.
Kassmier also presents himself as a fiscal conservative and alleges Regier is working with Democrats in the House and is “a true liberal” spending taxpayer money on things like lawyers and new office furniture.
“A real conservative would never dream of spending money like President Regier,” Kassmier said in the letter. “When it comes to spending taxpayer money, President Regier is not a leader I follow.”
From the start of the session, however, Regier has repeatedly expressed frustration with the size of the governor’s budget and an interest in taking a closer look at spending in the state.
The censure Friday and allegations in the letter from Kassmier bring the split among Senate Republicans to the fore again as the legislature closes in on its last few weeks of work.
However, Senate Majority Leader Tom McGillvray, R-Billings, said he will continue to work with all 32 Republicans and talk with them daily given the limited time left in the session.
“I’d like us to see us come together and get as much good legislation as we can out of here. So I’m not disowning anybody,” McGillvray said. “… I cannot look at a group of Republicans and say, ‘You don’t belong to us anymore.’
“That’s exactly a way to destroy what we need to accomplish for the good of Montana people.”
Kassmier said he echoed the sentiment toward unity. “We got a lot of work to do.”

(Photo | Isiah Holmes)Two people have been arrested at the Milwaukee County Courthouse by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, the sheriff’s office said Friday. Although the Milwaukee County Sheriffs Office (MCSO) was aware of the first arrest, the office states that it was not given advance notice of the second arrest. MCSO stressed in a statement that it did not participate in either arrest, and that it’s “not uncommon for local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies to search available databases for upcoming court hearings of individuals they are seeking.” 
MCSO has not responded to a request for more details. A spokesperson for ICE said the agency was unable to confirm the arrests without additional information about the specific targets. Fears of immigration operations have been heightened since President Donald Trump announced that the government would pursue mass deportations. ICE has made hundreds of arrests in recent months, including of people who were not convicted of any  crime and activists who participated in  protests on college campuses. 
Local groups and officials are condemning the arrests at the courthouse. Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said that the courthouse “stands as a cornerstone of justice where residents come to seek information, resources and fair participation in the legal process.” Crowley said that “an attack on this safe, community-serving space undermines public trust, breeds fear among citizens and staff and disrupts the due process essential to our courts.” Crowley called on local leaders to protect Milwaukee’s institutions, as well as due process for people in the judicial process. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Tim Muth, senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin, said in a statement that “such actions create fear among immigrant members of our community coming to the courthouse to seek justice as crime victims or witnesses.”  Muth added, “Research by the ACLU has shown that when ICE is known to be active in courthouses, members of the immigrant community are less likely to report crimes, less likely to cooperate with police and prosecutors, and less likely to make their court appearances. Our communities become less safe as a consequence.” 
In 2017, according to the ACLU’s “Freezing Out Justice” report, a survey sample of police officers reported that immigrants appeared less likely to report crimes after immigration operations conducted during Trump’s first term. Crime victims and witnesses were reluctant to assist police due to the fear of being deported. Legal service providers who worked with immigrant communities also reported encountering that victims chose to stay in abusive or dangerous situations rather than expose themselves to ICE operations. 
Muth and the ACLU call on the Milwaukee County court system and sheriff’s office to prevent similar actions in the future. “The last thing we want is to interfere with the legal process or sow doubt in those summoned to the courthouse about whether or not they will receive fair, impartial justice,” said Crowley. “I will continue working with our partners across the county and state to maintain safety and justice for all.”
The Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression also condemned the arrests. “We take this to be a sign of heightened racist and political repression against immigrants,” the Alliance said in a statement. “Furthermore, we are concerned by the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office acceptance of these arrests, stating that it’s not uncommon practice for agencies to access databases of people scheduled to appear before court. There is already very little trust with the MCSO, and now people have to fear for their safety inside the courthouse?”
The activist group, which has called for civilian oversight of law enforcement in Milwaukee County, stressed that people use the courthouse for all sorts of reasons, most of which are not related to criminal activity. “With today’s arrests, there is a further stigma placed on immigrants who enter the courthouse, making them feel even more criminalized,” the Alliance said in a statement. “We need city and county officials like the Sheriff to take a clear stance against ICE operating in Milwaukee. Sheriff [Denita] Ball has the authority to not collaborate with ICE, but this is a sign that she may very well choose to do so.”

They said the remainder of the venture would be funded by local, private foundations.
Currently, officials said, the Vikings of North High are the only high school in the Omaha Public Schools without a competitive home stadium for football and soccer. On game day, athletes, band members and fans travel to a different school to play.
Gene Haynes, a longtime North High principal and an OPS administrator for more than 40 years, was among speakers at a media event that included world champion boxer Terence “Bud” Crawford, students, alumni, community members, city leaders and school administrators.
Haynes recalled more than a decade ago when a group of students came to him with a stadium proposal they called “Leveling the playing field.” 
When he learned just recently that a stadium was to become a reality, without having to raze any homes, Haynes said he was “tickled pink.”
“We are going to continue to build this community,” he said.
 Change of plans 

A rendering unveiled during the announcement at the Butler-Gast YMCA shows the campus rising along Ames Avenue, just east of North High and on YMCA land.
The current 30-year-old Butler-Gast building will close for demolition this fall. A new structure with the same legacy name — honoring John Butler and Carol Gast, who were pivotal in creating opportunities for Black youths — will rise on the corner of North 34th and Ames Avenues, with a gym, pool, exercise and community rooms.

The Vikings stadium and a parking lot is to be built between the new YMCA structure and North High School.
Rebecca Deterding, CEO and president of the YMCA of Greater Omaha, said the idea for Project Game On came as YMCA leaders were moving forward with a planned renovation of the Butler-Gast building. 
For that, it was using a $2 million award from the North and South Omaha Recovery Grant program administered by the Nebraska Department of Economic Development.
State officials in January 2024 had announced nearly $235 million in awards to about 130 groups and businesses in North and South Omaha, including the YMCA. That pool of funds was part of the Economic Recovery Act money state lawmakers had allocated to help bring “transformational” change to historically disinvested areas.
The YMCA’s game plan changed, Deterding said, when the Lozier Foundation asked the nonprofit to consider a bigger project. She said the YMCA is providing the land for the overall project.
Lozier wanted to move swiftly so the DED grant, which is subject to a deadline, could be used as part of Project Game On, Deterding said.
The Sherwood Foundation also committed funding, officials said. Among other collaborators listed on a new website, projectgameon.org, include NewStreet Properties, Alley Poyner Macchietto Architecture, The City of Omaha, OPS, YMCA and Emspace + Lovgren. 
 ‘Game-changer’

Deterding called the project “a defining moment for North Omaha” that is about “transforming lives.” She said it was a testament to possibilities when public school districts and nonprofits come together with a shared vision.

“Through innovative partnerships like this, we are not only creating a new facility but also driving long-lasting community change — ensuring that families have access to the health, wellness and youth development opportunities they deserve for generations to come,” Deterding said.
Construction on the North High stadium is to begin later this year also. It will include a new press box, concessions, restrooms, team rooms and equipment storage. Stadium capacity will be similar to other Omaha public high school stadiums, such as Northwest High, where the Vikings currently play home games.
The current practice field at North High will remain as a practice field and home to the school’s track and field team, said Matthew Ray, OPS superintendent, who called the newly announced project site a “game-changer” for the community.
Other speakers included Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert and Nebraska’s State Poet Jewel Rodgers, who introduced her former principal, Haynes.
Said Stothert: “Together these facilities will create an environment for excellence in competition, sportsmanship and teamwork, access to fitness, recreation and wellness programs and a community space where Viking fans will gather to celebrate victories of years past and future.”

(Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest  photo)Federal land managers have canceled their proposal to withdraw about 264,000 acres of public land in Nevada’s Ruby Mountain from oil, gas and geothermal development.
The U.S. Forest Service said the decision to allow oil and gas leasing to continue in Elko County’s Ruby Mountains was brought on by a presidential executive order titled “Unleashing American Energy,” and calling on federal land managers to remove regulatory barriers to energy production and expand access to federal lands and waters for energy exploration.
In a statement Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Forest Service, said the agency was “removing the burdensome Biden-era regulations that have stifled energy and mineral development to revitalize rural communities and reaffirm America’s role as a global energy powerhouse.”
In December, the Forest Service first announced their intention to ban oil,gas, and geothermal leasing on about 264,000 acres of public land in the Ruby Mountains for up to 20 years. That directive has now been reversed by Trump appointed USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins.
As part of the directive, the agency also canceled plans to withdraw about 165,000 acres of public land in New Mexico’s Upper Pecos River Watershed from mining and geothermal leasing, according to the USDA.
Signs that the proposed ban was in trouble started on Feb. 14, when federal land managers in Nevada canceled a public meeting for the proposed oil and gas leasing ban on the same day thousands of federal workers were indiscriminately fired, including more than a dozen National Park Service employees in Nevada. 
Nevada’s Ruby Mountains have been targeted by Trump in the past. During Trump’s first term, his administration proposed auctioning off more than 500,000 acres of land in Nevada for oil and gas drilling leases, including about 54,000 acres in the Ruby Mountains.
In response, Nevada Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto has pushed several versions of a bill that would withdraw about 450,000 acres of land adjacent to the Ruby Mountain from oil and gas leasing, but not mining.
Sometimes called “Nevada’s Swiss Alps” the Ruby Mountains in Elko County are the ancestral homelands of the Te-Moak Tribe of the Western Shoshone Indians of Nevada. The Ruby Lake National Wildlife Refuge also includes a wetland oasis for migratory waterfowl in the Pacific Flyway and fisheries that include trout and largemouth bass, attracting hunters, anglers, birdwatchers and other recreational tourists. 
Nevada has seen something of an oil and gas leasing boom in recent years, with the Interior Department putting hundreds of thousands of acres on the block for lease. However, oil and gas production in Nevada has always been negligible, and both industry and environmentalists remain skeptical that significant production in Nevada will make economic sense any time soon.
Over 90 percent of public lands managed by the Interior Department in Nevada are available to be leased for oil and gas drilling. Once leased, public lands are locked up from being managed for multiple uses such as outdoor recreation and conservation for the life of the lease, which could be 10, 20 or even 30 years.
Forestry land open to timber production
The Ruby Mountains reversal comes as the Forest Service announced Friday that the agency plans to open nearly 43 million acres of National Forest System land to timber production. 
The Forest Service said another 112 million acres of National Forest System land would be listed for culling to reduce wildfire risk, or 59% of all National Forest System land. The Ruby Mountains are included in the 112 million acres of National Forestry System slated for wildfire fuel reduction, according to a USDA map.
The secretarial memo comes on the heels of Trump’s executive order to expand American timber production by 25%. The memo directs federal employees to increase timber outputs, simplify permitting, and remove National Environmental Policy Act processes.
““I am proud to follow the bold leadership of President Trump by empowering forest managers to reduce constraints and minimize the risks of fire, insects, and disease so that we can strengthen the American timber industry and further enrich our forests with the resources they need to thrive,” Rollins said in a statement Friday.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ruby-mountains-snowy-tho-1024x578.jpg,,,2025-04-04 20:04:56.095190

Stanley Dunlap/Georgia RecorderFormer Albany Herald business reporter Bárbara Rivera Holmes became the first Hispanic woman to hold a statewide executive office position when she was sworn in Friday as state labor commissioner.
During Friday’s swearing-in ceremony, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp trumpeted Holmes’ groundbreaking accomplishment becoming Georgia’s first Hispanic woman to become a constitutional officer. The former news reporter resigned as president and CEO of the Albany Area Chamber of Commerce after being selected by Kemp to fill the remaining term of former Labor Commissioner Bruce Thompson, who died in November following an eight-month battle with pancreatic cancer.
“Like I said last month when we announced the appointment of Bárbara Rivera Holmes to this position, I said that she was smart, accomplished and dedicated to growing opportunities for hard working Georgians,” Kemp said. “She also brings unique experience in economic development, especially in rural parts of our state, and education at the highest levels in our state will benefit all those who are looking for work.”
Holmes will begin leading the Georgia Department of Labor amid rising fears of a recession as President Donald Trump’s administration levies historic tariffs that critics argue could raise the price of U.S. goods while disrupting the global economy.
Her predecessor, Thompson, spent a decade in the Senate prior to becoming labor commissioner in 2023, taking over a state agency that had struggled to process a surge of unemployment claims since the start of the pandemic.
Late Georgia Labor Commissioner Bruce Thompson honored by state senators for his service

On Friday, Holmes credited her family’s sacrifices that included her grandparents in 1961 seeking political refuge from Cuba in America as the driving force in her becoming the state’s 11th labor commissioner.
Holmes said Friday that she plans to run for a four-year term as labor commissioner when her current term ends in the 2026 election year.
“The Department of Labor is vital to our state’s economy for supporting workforce development, job attainment, safe working conditions and the prosperity of our communities,” she said.

(Moe Clark/Colorado Newsline)Two bills that would strengthen protections for transgender people and gender-affirming care won preliminary approval in the Colorado House on Friday.
They come as transgender rights and protections are put on shaky ground at the federal level under the Trump administration, which has issued orders to recognize only two unchangeable genders, stop offering non-binary passport gender markers, and attempts to stop funding care for transgender minors.
“What’s happening at the federal level is casting a long shadow and we don’t know what the future holds. There is a real possibility that gender-affirming care could be at risk,” said Rep. Brianna Titone, an Arvada Democrat and the Legislature’s only transgender member. “Passing this bill is about telling Coloradans that no, we are not going to let that happen. It’s about taking control of what we can do to ensure that our friends and neighbors and family members continue to get the care they need regardless of what might happen in the future.”
As more states enact policy to restrict care, especially for minors, Colorado could further become an island of access and absorb more out-of-state patients.

It would make it illegal for health insurers to deny or limit care deemed medically necessary by a doctor, which could include hormone therapy and procedures like facial surgery, breast augmentations and genital reconstruction.
“What can be created by rules can also be undone,” said bill sponsor Rep. Kyle Brown, a Louisville Democrat. “This bill codifies existing standards into statute to provide long-term stability and clarity for patients.”
The bill would also exempt prescriptions for testosterone from the state’s Prescription Drug Use Monitoring Program, which shares data across pharmacies and providers to mitigate abuse of controlled substances.
Republicans offered a failed amendment during the chamber’s two-hour debate on the bill to limit covered care to adults only, arguing that minors are not mentally developed enough to make such medical decisions. They pointed to Colorado laws that place age restrictions on other behavior like buying firearms and getting a tattoo.
“You can’t even buy a betta fish until you’re 18. But we’re going to allow (doctors) to perform lifelong sterility based with no (Food and Drug Administration) approval and no systematic review,” said Rep. Brandi Bradley, a Littleton Republican.
“If you’re an adult, make your own decision. But for the love of humanity, protect the children who don’t understand that these things are not FDA approved or haven’t been reviewed by any research. Let these children go through puberty,” she said.
The FDA has approved puberty blockers for precocious puberty. The medication’s use is considered off-label for youth gender-affirming care, but it has been standard care for decades.
Democrats responded that decisions about gender-affirming health care for transgender children are made between the patient, their families and their doctor. Leading medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, recommend that gender-diverse children have access to developmentally-appropriate care.
“I think we should consult everyone in the equation, especially the person the care is being directed to,” Titone said.
Schools and courts
The other bill, House Bill 25-1312, aims to add protections for transgender people in schools and courts. It would require courts to consider as a form of coercive control actions like deadnaming — using a transgender person’s previous name before transitioning in order to reject their identity — and misgendering in child custody decisions. It would also shield parents who help their child obtain gender-affirming care from court orders in other states that outlaw the practice.
“Supporting a child’s gender identity is indeed in the best interest of the child, and that support cannot be used against a loving and supportive parent in a dispute,” said bill sponsor Rep. Rebekah Stewart, a Lakewood Democrat.
But Republicans argued the bill’s provisions for custody decisions would be an “erosion” on parental rights.
“The idea that misgendering your own child is considered coercive control, which is another word for child abuse, because you want to get your child help instead of affirming their delusions … this is the most disgusting bill I’ve seen so far,” said Rep. Jarvis Caldwell, a Colorado Springs Republican.
The bill would also label deadnaming and misgendering as discriminatory acts under the state’s anti-discrimination law.
Schools could not adopt a gender-based dress code under the bill. If a school has an adopted policy related to chosen names, that policy would have to be “inclusive of all reasons that a student might adopt a chosen name that differs from the student’s legal name.” The Legislature approved a law last year that concerns students’ chosen names in public schools.
“This bill is truly the least that we can do. Frankly, I wish that we didn’t have to bring this bill, but the reality of navigating the world today as a transgender human necessitates it,” Stewart said.
Both bills still need a final recorded vote in the House before heading to the Senate. Democrats hold majorities in both chambers and do not need any Republican votes to pass legislation.

(Otto Kitsinger for the Idaho Capital Sun)As expected, the Idaho Legislature wrapped up its business Friday and adjourned the 2025 legislative session after 89 days at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. 
The 2025 session was dominated by a series of tax cuts that also reduce the amount of state revenue that is available to pay for the state budget. 

House Bill 40 lowers both the individual and corporate income tax from 5.695% to 5.3% and reduces state revenue by $253 million.
House Bill 304 shifts money to a state property tax reduction fund and a fund to pay for school facilities. To pay for the shifts, the new law reduces state revenue by $100 million.
House Bill 231 increases the grocery tax credit that is designed to offset the sales tax Idahoans pay for food to $155 per year for everyone. To pay for the increased grocery tax credit, House Bill 231 reduces state revenue by $50 million.

Another new law, House Bill 93, provides a refundable tax credit for education expenses for families, including tuition and private, religious schools. To pay for the tax credits, House Bill 93 reduces state revenue by $50 million. 
  Rep. Mike Moyle, R-Star, listens to proceedings during a during a Ways and Means Committee hearing at the Idaho Capitol on April 6, 2021. (Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)
House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, said the tax cuts were among the biggest, most enduring accomplishments of the year.
“We have over $400 million in tax relief this year,” Moyle said Friday afternoon.
“We touched income tax, we touched property tax, we touched sales tax and we did a good job of adjusting all of those in a downward trend, which is good for the state of Idaho,” Moyle said. 
Each of the laws reduces the taxes Idahoans pay, help pay down school bonds and levies that are paid for by property taxes or provides a tax credit. But to do so, those four laws reduce state revenue by a combined $453 million.
  Democrats say walking away from funding hurts Idaho 

Democratic legislative leaders had a different perspective on the tax cuts, saying that they worry the Idaho Legislature cut too much revenue and could stretch the state thin in the event of an economic downturn.
House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, also said that to make room for tax cuts, Republican legislators walked away from grant programs and zeroed out a series of initiatives from Gov. Brad Little. Rubel said legislators walked away from $15 million from the affordable housing fund, $22 million for road and bridge repair, almost $25 million in home energy rebates that will now go to other states, cut a requested expansion of a rural physician loan repayment program, cut workforce training programs at Idaho colleges and more.

“These are debts that are going to be left for our children and grandchildren to pay with a shrunken pot of revenue to cover it,” Rubel said Friday. “This is the textbook opposite of fiscal conservatism, folks.”
In a statement issued late Friday afternoon, Little congratulated legislators on what he called “a productive 2025 legislative session.”
“America wants what Idaho has – safe communities, bustling economic activity, increasing incomes, tax relief, fewer regulations, fiscal responsibility, and common sense values,” Little wrote. “I thank my partners in the Idaho Legislature for working so hard for the people of Idaho. I am especially proud of the record tax relief, support for law enforcement, ongoing money for water infrastructure, additional support for rural school facilities and literacy, full funding for Launch, and the billions in additional capacity for roads. The list of successes is long, and there is still more we can and should do for Idahoans.”
 Idaho legislators united beyond anti-SLAPP law and created new media shield law 

While there is no doubt the 2025 legislative session was contentious and divisive, legislators from both parties did come together at times. 
On March 5, the Idaho House voted unanimously to pass Senate Bill 1001, a new law designed to protect free speech and combat frivolous strategic lawsuits against public participation, or SLAPP, lawsuits. Little signed the anti-SLAPP bill into law March 10.  
The Idaho House and Idaho Senate also voted unanimously to pass House Bill 158, a new media shield law that protects sources who provide confidential information or documents to journalists. Little signed the shield protections into law on March 27.
The Idaho Legislature also passed House Bill 445, the 2026 Idaho Department of Water Resources budget that includes $30 million in funding for water infrastructure projects. Following a 2024 water curtailment order that sent shockwaves through Idaho’s agricultural community, some legislators called House Bill 445 the most important bill of the 2025 session
 Idaho legislative session ran two weeks past nonbinding adjournment target 

This year’s legislative session was marked by a sharp increase in the volume of legislation that was prepared. According to data compiled by the nonpartisan Idaho Legislative Services Office, as of Friday staffers prepared 1,036 pieces of legislation this year – by far the most pieces of legislation in the past six years. For comparison, over the same time period in 2023, staffers had only prepared 861 pieces of legislation. 
Idaho legislators missed the Republican leadership team’s original adjournment target date of March 21 because the 2026 budget was unfinished and because of ongoing disagreements between leaders of the Idaho House and Idaho Senate.
Legislators nearly wrapped up their business for the year Thursday, when they passed key unfinished elements of the 2026 budget. But Senate leaders said they were short-staffed and the procedures required to wrap up the session would have kept them too late last night. 
Friday was the 89th day of the 2025 legislative session, which began Jan. 6. 
The 2024 legislative session adjourned sine die on April 10, after 94 days in session.

Brad Little gives his annual State of the State address on Jan. 6, 2025, on the House floor at the Statehouse in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)As the Idaho Legislature ended the 2025 legislative session on Friday, lawmakers quickly passed a reworked version of a so-called medical freedom bill.
Senate Bill 1210 is the Legislature’s response to a similar bill Gov. Brad Little vetoed Saturday.
The new bill still pursues a similarly broad medical mandate ban, which would bar Idaho businesses, government entities, schools and colleges from restricting entry, employment or services based on requirements for medical interventions — like vaccines, medical diagnosis or treatment. 
Lawmakers spent much of Friday without taking action, as they waited for the House to attempt to amend the bill. The House amended the bill just before 2 p.m.
In the House’s debate over its new version of the bill earlier this week, critics’ main concern was that the bill would prevent workplaces from refusing service or entry to sick people.
That appears to be true under the bill. 
On Friday, the House rejected an amendment attempt described as a way to shield employers from liability if sick employees who refuse to leave get injured at work.

Despite this being the third iteration of the bill the House has considered, and despite the House’s amendments earlier Friday, Rep. Todd Achilles, D-Boise, said the bill remained “deeply flawed” and it keeps the same “overly broad definition” of medical intervention. 
The Idaho House passed the bill on a 44-23 vote at about 3 p.m. Friday. An hour later, the Senate passed it on a 27-6 vote. 
After passing both chambers of the Idaho Legislature on Friday, the new bill — which carves out exceptions for schools to send home sick kids — now heads to the Idaho governor for final consideration. 
When the bill is transmitted to the governor, he has five days, excluding Sundays, to decide on it. He has three options: sign it into law, allow it to become law without his signature, or veto it.

 How the bill works: Medical mandates include diagnosis, prevention or cure to diseases. Extends to entry or service refusal.

Under the bill, medical interventions include “a procedure, treatment, device, drug injection, medication, or action taken to diagnose, prevent, or cure a disease or alter the health or biological function of a person.”
For businesses and any Idaho governments — local, county or state — the bill bans requiring medical interventions for employment, admission to venues, transportation, or providing products or services.
Idaho schools — private or public — including colleges, universities and trade schools would also be blocked from requiring medical interventions for school attendance, employment, or entrance into campus or school buildings.
The bill is cosponsored by Rep. Robert Beiswenger, R-Horseshoe Bend, and Sen. Dan Foreman, R-Moscow.

Earlier this week, Beiswenger told House lawmakers the bill “prevents medical force, medical mandates. People can choose them if they want to, but they don’t have to if they don’t want to. You can ask people to leave your place of business. But you can’t force them into medical treatments like vaccines or other kinds of treatments.”
The new broader medical intervention requirement ban would expand on a previous Idaho law banning COVID vaccine requirements. 
In 2023, Little signed the COVID vaccine requirement ban law, despite its similarities to one he vetoed a year earlier, the Idaho Statesman reported.
 Bill emerged out of Legislature’s week of work to respond to governor’s veto

The bill came after a week-long, fast-moving effort by Idaho lawmakers to respond to Little’s veto on the original bill the Legislature passed, Senate Bill 1023. 
Explaining his veto, Little wrote he valued medical freedom but worried that the bill “removes parents’ freedom to ensure their children stay healthy at school because it jeopardizes the ability of schools to send home sick students with highly contagious conditions,” including measles.
On Thursday, the Senate failed to override the governor’s veto on a 20-14 vote, falling short of the two-third support needed, Idaho Education News reported.
Senate Bill 1210, the Senate’s revised version of the original bill, succeeded over the House’s revised version, House Bill 472, which passed the House but never received a Senate committee hearing. 
The Senate’s version adds language specifying the school medical mandate ban provision is subject to various other Idaho laws that let school boards block sick students from attending, spell out parental rights, and more. The House amended the bill earlier this week to remove an exemption for day cares. 
On Friday, the House amended the Senate’s version to:

Include private and parochial schools as being allowed to block sick students from attending;
Bar state agencies from adopting regulations, including policy or administrative rule, that conflicts with the bill; and
Add a new section stating that “Not withstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, under no circumstances may a healthy person be excluded in a disease outbreak due to such person’s vaccination status.”

The original bill, Senate Bill 1023, was amended twice before passing the Legislature. The Senate’s revised version that passed was also amended twice.

Asked by another lawmaker in a House committee Friday morning about the bill’s chance of securing the governor’s approval, Foreman was hopeful.

“I won’t speak on behalf of the gentleman on the second floor,” Foreman replied, using a common phrase legislators use to discuss the governor’s office on the second floor of the Statehouse. “But I guess I would term it this way. If I was — no disrespect intended here — but if I was going to Vegas, I would have really good odds.”
Asked about confidence lawmakers expressed in the governor supporting the bill Friday afternoon, House Assistant Majority Leader Josh Tanner, R-Eagle, said he thought “everybody’s in agreement and the issues are resolved.”
Later Friday, the governor’s spokesperson, Joan Varsek, told the Sun the governor’s office doesn’t comment on bills until Little acts on them.

Paul Thomas, R-Velva, speaks on the Senate floor on April 4, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A bill prohibiting cellphone use by North Dakota students during the school day failed Friday in the Senate on a 26-19 vote.
House Bill 1160, sponsored by Rep. Jim Jonas. R-West Fargo, would have prohibited student cellphone use from “bell-to-bell,” including class time and unstructured time in between classes for the entire school day. It would cover cellphones, bluetooth-enabled devices, smart watches and other wearable devices capable of voice, text and other data transfers between students.
Students would also have been required to store their devices in a locked box or pouch so they would remain inaccessible in between classes.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong advocated for the elimination of student cellphone use during the school day during the committee hearing. He argued getting rid of the devices would improve students’ mental health and academic performance.

Sen. Mike Wobbema, R-Valley City, supported the bill on the floor. He said school districts that have implemented a school day ban on phone use reported increased social interaction, more participation in club activities, improvement in academic performance and the return of conversational noise in the hallways.
“It is past time that we throw our young students a lifeline and put in place the tools to rescue them from the addiction of social media and other screen applications,” Wobbema said.
Sen. Paul Thomas, R-Velva, who voted against the bill, said school districts can already implement bans on phone use during the school day.
“We have communities that don’t allow cellphones in their schools and it’s working quite well,” Thomas said. “My concern here is, if I was a school board member, I would vote for this. As a legislator, I don’t think it’s our role to tell the school boards what to do.”
Senate Bill 2354 included the same language as the bill that failed in the Senate. But Rep. Dori Hauck, R-Hebron, a member of the House Education Committee, said the committee amended that version to include more flexibility for school boards.
The amended Senate bill would allow students to use their phones on field trips and only require them to be stowed away during instructional time, not stored in a lock box or pouch during the school day. She said the bill would also give school boards the power to limit or allow student phone use outside of instructional time, such as in between classes or over lunch.
“It gives the school districts a little bit more flexibility on what they can and can’t do and they get to make the choice, rather than us making the choice for them,” Hauck said. 
The House is expected to vote on that bill on Monday.
One of the younger members of the Legislature, 26-year-old Sen. Claire Cory, R-Grand Forks, said she was able to use a cellphone with no restrictions while she was in high school. She voted against the measure because she believes the issue was best left up to local school boards.
“It’s not up to the state to control the local policies so I’d hope the school boards would come in with their individual policies on what works best for their schools,” Cory said.

Laura Kelly vetoed six bills Friday afternoon, drawing the ire of Republican leadership who promised veto overrides when the Legislature reconvenes April 10.
House Democratic Leader Brandon Woodard, D-Lenexa, voiced support for the vetoes, citing concerns with power grabs, overreach and threats to public health in the bills.
Senate Bill 29 addresses the rights of the county or local health officer and others to prohibit gatherings of large groups for reasons of infectious disease.
“Taking away the authority of public health officials to prohibit public gatherings and issue quarantines when necessary for the control of infectious or contagious disease directly contradicts effective, evidence-based health intervention advice and would put the health and safety of Kansans at unnecessary risk,” Kelly said. “While this legislation is likely motivated by the politics coming out of the recent pandemic, it would cause actual harm in efforts to mitigate current outbreaks related to measles, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases.”
Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, and House Speaker Dan Hawkins, R-Wichita, issued a joint statement condemning the governor’s “Friday afternoon news dump vetoes.”
On SB 29, they said: “Fauci-ism — and its unconstitutional restrictions and dystopian rules — deserves to be on the ash-heap of history. This bill protects the right to assemble — think churches, funerals and weddings — while enhancing core due process rights.”
Kelly said House Bill 2217, which expands the scope of the inspector general to audit and investigate all state cash, food or health assistance programs, was unnecessary because a fraud investigations unit already exists within the Kansas Department for Children and Families.
“This bill also removes statutory protections for participants’ data and health privacy,” she said. “It makes no sense from a legal, policy or fiscal standpoint to make this change.”
Masterson and Hawkins said Kelly was ignoring an opportunity to protect against fraud.
“After the $700 million unemployment fraud debacle on the governor’s watch, one would think she’d learn from past mistakes and work toward ending waste, fraud and abuse in the welfare system — ensuring benefits go to the people who truly need them,” they said.
Senate Bill 79 bars anyone on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program from buying candy and soft drinks with food assistance. Kelly called the bill “simply wrong,” saying it would make it more difficult for Kansas families to access food they need and would harm Kansas businesses.
“The waiver required by this bill is confusing and will cause problems for our grocers and small businesses. Under the definition in that waiver, Kansas businesses would be mandated to stop accepting food assistance benefits for protein bars, trail mix, and other food products many would consider ‘healthy,’ ” she said. “Meanwhile, items like Twix, KitKat and Twizzlers would still be eligible for purchase using food assistance benefits. It’s nonsensical.”

Masterson and Hawkins said studies show obesity is impacting children with low incomes the most.
“It’s disappointing the governor doubled down on her anything-goes approach to welfare,” they said.
Woodard said the legislation would harm low-income families “by limiting access to food, health care and more.”
“While Democrats have pushed for essential changes to improve childhood nutrition and reduce stigma,” he added, “Republicans have continuously blocked these efforts.”

House Bill 2291 would create a regulatory relief division within the Attorney General’s Office and established an advisory committee. Kelly said she supported the bill’s intent but had concerns about the lawmaking power of the advisory committee.
House Bill 2284 sets written policies to govern procurement of managed care organizations to provide state Medicaid services. Kelly said she supported it in its original form and supported a more transparent process. However, she said, amendments made it “unworkable.”

“Additionally, this bill is a dramatic overreach by the Legislature into the role of the executive branch, which is charged with administering and executing policy,” she said. “It also overreaches into the judicial branch by removing the courts from the process entirely and vesting that duty squarely with the Legislature’s ad hoc ‘appeals committee’ — a move that calls into question the very constitutionality of this bill by denying the rights of ‘judicial review’ to those involved.”
Masterson and Hawkins said the legislation would provide a more transparent bidding process for government contracts.
“Taxpayers deserve better than lost paperwork, backroom deals and made-up rules on the fly,” they said.

House Bill 2033 adds programs and services to approved at-risk educational programs, both Kelly and Woodard saw the bill as getting in the way of the Kansas State Board of Education.
The governor allowed House Bill 2101, which prohibits municipalities from adopting and implementing a guaranteed income program, and House Bill 2020, which requires a quarterly report listing the names, addresses and alien registration numbers of certain noncitizens who have been issued a driver’s license, to become law without her signature.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/241218_kelly-03-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-04 19:05:03.622722

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Senate on Friday approved a controversial bill allowing a state agency to trump local government zoning authority on electrical transmission lines. 
The 27-18 vote went against the wishes of landowners gathered in the chamber and a committee recommendation. 
Supporters of House Bill 1258, including Sen. Terry Wanzek, R-Jamestown, said unreasonable setback rules threaten to shut down power line projects that benefit the whole state. 
Wanzek represents an area where a large power line is planned but a township rule says the line must be a half-mile from residences and threatens to make finding a route impossible.  
“Most of the time, I support local control,” Wanzek said. But he said the current situation allows a township board and just a few landowners to stop a major project.
“Sometimes the local folks go a little too far,” Wanzek said. 
Some bill opponents referenced the landowners who traveled to oppose the bill, both on Friday and in a previous hearing where they overflowed the committee room.

Sen. Keith Boehm, R-Mandan, said the bill was drafted to support a single project, though it would affect future high-voltage powerlines. Testimony in committee referenced the JETx project, a transmission line from Jamestown to Ellendale with towers that are 150 feet high. 
“Every time we use legislation to push something through, we poke that bear, and if it wakes up, the consequences will be far more dramatic,” Boehm warned. 
The bill gives the state Public Service Commission, which approves power line projects and related utility rate increases, the ability to determine that a local ordinance is unreasonable. 
The commission last year approved the JETx project in a split vote. 
The bill had the support of utility companies that argued restrictive zoning laws drive up the cost of power line projects and mean higher bills for customers.  
The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on Thursday gave the bill a do-not-pass recommendation on a 4-3 vote. 
The bill had previously passed the House 86-7. It now goes to Gov. Kelly Armstrong.

The U4U parole program has not been terminated,” a DHS spokesperson told States Newsroom, referring to the Uniting for Ukraine program.Attorneys challenging the Trump administration’s pause of humanitarian applications for Ukrainians and Afghans, as well as the end of legal status programs for nationals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, filed a copy of the termination notice sent to Ukrainians in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts on Friday.The notice, given on Thursday, instructs any Ukrainians in the Uniting for Ukraine humanitarian parole program to leave the U.S. within seven days of receiving the notice, according to court filings. “It is time for you to leave the United States,” according to the notice sent to some Ukrainians that immigration rights groups filed in court. “If you do not depart the United States immediately you will be subject to potential law enforcement actions that will result in your removal from the United States — unless you have otherwise obtained a lawful basis to remain here.”The next hearing is set for Monday before U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.‘Numerous reports’ of erroneous emails“Plaintiffs’ counsel have received numerous reports throughout the day today that other Ukrainian members of the putative class—potentially thousands—have received an identical letter, including individuals with approximately two years left on their parole period,” according to the brief by Justice Action Center, an immigrant rights group.According to the brief filed Friday, attorneys with the Justice Action Center notified the Department of Justice attorneys handling the case. The lawyers said the response from those DOJ attorneys was “to say that they ‘have been looking into this’ but ‘don’t have any information to share yet.’”The Biden administration’s renewed work and deportation protections for 103,700 Ukrainians are set to expire on Oct. 19, 2026.Trump and ZelenskyyIn late February, President Donald Trump got into a heated exchange with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a meeting at the White House, breaking with Ukraine and its resistance to Russia’s invasion more than three years ago.Former President Joe Biden’s administration created temporary protections for Ukrainians because of Russia’s invasion of the country.Trump’s history with Ukraine, which was at the center of his first impeachment when he halted security aid approved by Congress, and his friendly relationship with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, have moved the U.S. further away from European allies who have coalesced around Ukraine’s fight for its democracy.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt in early March denied that the Trump administration was revoking protections for Ukrainians.“The truth: no decision has been made at this time,” Leavitt wrote on social media.",,,,2025-04-04 19:05:03.622722

A fix to health care availability for children without parental consent, including the ability to undergo a sexual assault exam, may be off the table in 2025.
The Senate voted 26-9 on Monday to move SB 1199aa forward to the House of Representatives. After being read on the House floor, the bill was routed to the House Judiciary, Rules and Administration Committee.

Chairman of the committee Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa, told Idaho Reports on Thursday that his committee was “closed until next year.” Without a public hearing in the House, the bill cannot move forward.
The bill could have been run through another committee, such as the Ways and Means Committee, but that would be the decision of House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star.
Moyle told Idaho Reports on Thursday afternoon after that he was unsure how he’d move forward, as he was already hearing about amendments that some people wanted to make to the bill. Moyle said Skaug would need to return the bill for it to go to Ways and Means.
Senate President Pro Tempore Kelly Anthon, R-Rupert, sponsored the 2024 law and brought the bill late in the session after talking to stakeholders. It would clarify that a child may receive medical care if there is concern for “loss of life or aggravation of physiological or psychological illness.”

The bill would also allow care if a minor “is seeking health care or medical treatment … that is directly related to an allegation of a crime against the minor child or to collect evidence related to such crime when the collection of such evidence is time sensitive.”
The change comes after the original law left some health care providers with concerns that juveniles couldn’t receive rape kit examinations without parental permission.
Anthon has repeatedly said this was not the intent of the 2024 bill, and it needs to be amended this year.
The new bill also would allow first aid-related care in cases of minor injuries and illnesses, after some public school districts raised concerns in 2024.
Additionally, the new bill states that if a juvenile is pregnant or has a child, health care providers may provide treatment without parental consent. Heath care providers could also diagnose pregnancy and provide prenatal or peripartum care without seeking parental consent, as long as the care complied with Idaho’s laws banning abortion.
Other changes in the bill would allow juveniles to access services of the Idaho crisis and suicide hotline, or services to help those who are experiencing mental health crisis and present “imminent risk of serious injury to self or others.”

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Advocates thought hard-fought battles over the Development Disability Administration budget were behind them — then the Moore administration dropped a supplemental budget Wednesday that cuts a fresh $28.8 million from the agency.
After successfully clawing back more than $300 million from the roughly $450 million in cuts that Gov. Wes Moore (D) originally proposed in his fiscal 2026 budget at the beginning of the session, advocates said they felt “betrayed” by the new cuts in the waning days of the session.
“I feel like our trust has been betrayed, because we worked so hard to come up with something that was reasonable and workable,” Tracy Wright, deputy director for People on the Go Maryland, said Friday morning outside the State House. “We’re going to lose dedicated direct support professionals.”
Advocates are particularly concerned about what they see as a last-minute proposal to cut a planned 1% raise for service providers.
In earlier budget go-rounds, the Moore administration and lawmakers had fought suggestions from state fiscal analysts to reduce the 1% cost of-living increase for health care providers across state, including those who support people with developmental disabilities.

But with the cuts needed for the state’s latest supplemental budget, those DDA provider increases were back on the chopping block. Senate leadership indicated Friday the cuts outlined in the second supplemental budget are likely going to stick around.
“We need those changes,” Budget and Taxation Chair Guy Guzzone (D-Howard) said in a news conference conference Friday. “We needed decisions on that to actually get to the balanced budget. They’re tough, but we’ve got to get out of here with a balanced budget.”
The elimination of the 1% increase for providers would save the state $14.4 million in general funding, which also removes $14.4 million from federal matching dollars through Medicaid.
Advocates worry that developmental disability service providers that were already facing staffing shortages before the legislative session began in January will just see the situation get worse with the new cuts.
“These cuts would affect whether direct support staff get a raise this year, which may affect whether they stay or seek a better paying job,” said Ken Capone, an advocate with developmental disabilities.
The Developmental Disabilities Administration serves some 18,000 Marylanders, but was hard hit by proposed budget cuts earlier in the year. By working with lawmakers and organizing well-attended rallies at the State House, the development disabilities community was able to whittle the cuts down to what it called “survivable” levels.
But Mat Rice, executive director for People on the Go Maryland, said that he was “disappointed” that new cuts were being considered this late in session.
“This is a very critical time for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families,” Rice said. “We don’t know what’s going to happen at the federal level, and we were relying on the state to hold the line.”
With the legislative session scheduled to end Monday, and budget negotiations between the House and Senate getting firmer by the hour, advocates fear time is running out to restore the new $28.8 million cut.
“If I am being completely honest … I don’t see that as a realistic possibility,” Rice said. “It’s just so late in the game.”
But the cut still stings, even after hundreds gathered on at Lawyer’s Mall and many nights of working with lawmakers to find a compromise in the tight budget year.
“To Marylanders with developmental disabilities, we just can’t take the cut,” Wright said. “We worked so hard.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025_apr4_dda_cut_providerincrease2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-04 18:07:06.076079

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Over the past year, the board that governs one of Oklahoma’s flagship public universities has racked up tens of thousands of dollars in bills while eating costly meals, listening to live music and enjoying optional social events and other entertainment outside board meetings. 
In all, it has cost over $69,000 to host 13 Oklahoma A&M Board of Regents meetings, according to an analysis of over 270 pages of the receipts from the meetings compiled by Oklahoma State University in response to an open records request. That figure excludes about $11,000 in mileage reimbursement. 
When that’s factored in, it costs over $6,100 each time the regents meet.
Records show the OSU system and Northeastern Oklahoma A&M College shouldered the burden of those costs, spending over $45,000 on meals and refreshments and thousands more to purchase fresh flowers. They hosted “social” events, and even once hired a string quartet to entertain the regents. At one point, the total cost to host a single meeting at OSU’s Tulsa campus soared to over $13,000. 
The OSU Foundation, the fundraising arm of the state’s second largest university, meanwhile, chipped in to treat regents to a hospitality suite and help them pay for a “whiskey tasting,” receipts show.

The governing board has been under increased scrutiny since the abrupt resignation of OSU president Kayse Shrum in February. It has since signed a contract with a crisis communications firm with close ties to Gov. Kevin Stitt. 
Current regents and the board’s chief executive officer declined to answer specific questions about the expenditures. But the expenses raised questions about optics during a time when Republicans, including the governor, are pressing for greater efficiencies with taxpayer dollars and four of the five universities the entity oversees had tuition increases approved. 
An industry “norm”
But, former board chairwoman and regent Trudy Milner said the costs are not “exorbitant,” and are an industry “norm.” Milner resigned in February, days after Shrum stepped down. 
Republican Gov. Mary Fallin appointed Milner to the board in 2013 to help oversee the Oklahoma State University system, Langston University, Connors State College, Northeast Oklahoma A&M College and Oklahoma Panhandle State University, which combined serve an estimated 42,000 students.
Many of the regent meetings span two days, Milner said, with a dinner scheduled on a Thursday without any formal business. The official meeting typically takes place the following day. Milner said the dinners ahead of a meeting could include the regents and their spouses as well as presidents, representatives from other campuses, and community leaders. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXSome receipts indicate dozens of people attended the dinners based on per plate charges, but the records do not identify the guests.
After a dinner, the regents often have a bar set up with snacks at the hotel they’re staying at to “talk informally” for the “camaraderie of it,” Milner said.
While the receipts obtained by Oklahoma Voice do not reflect the purchase of alcohol, one notes that a bartender was hired at a price of $150 for a dinner on Jan. 25, 2024. Another record details a “Board of Regents Night Cap” with a “social” theme in December. 
Others reveal that the OSU Foundation footed the bill for cups and signage to facilitate a whiskey tasting for the regents as well as spending about $250 on personalized cookies, $900 in refreshments, snacks and other items, and over $1,200 for a “hospitality suite.”
The OSU Foundation did not respond to requests for comment. The foundation’s website said the private, nonprofit organization’s role is to “manage donor dollars to provide the most advanced educational opportunities to students, faculty, staff, alumni and friends of OSU.”
Recently, the foundation hosted an online fundraising event aimed in part at raising money to help OSU’s food insecure students. As of Friday, the foundation’s site said it had raised over $20,000 to help students. The fundraiser noted that nearly 50% of OSU students grapple with some level of food insecurity.

Milner said the universities provided meals and entertainment for the regents, but the entertainment usually came in the form of touring campus facilities. She said they once visited a shooting range at Panhandle State University. 
Receipts show in January 2024 that a string quartet was hired at the cost of over $800, at OSU’s expense.
Mack Burke, an OSU spokesperson, said in a statement that the ensemble was made up of OSU students that performed to “highlight our support of the arts and our students” which he said is “standard operating procedure” for higher education boards. 
Current board chair Jimmy Harrel has said he didn’t want to go to campuses besides OSU’s, Milner said. Since January 2024, records show all but one of the 13 meetings took place at an OSU campus.
Meetings are supposed to rotate among schools who share the hosting responsibilities so the cost is not on one campus, Milner said. 
“I think it’s been grossly unfair that OSU had to host it this whole entire year and then they canceled the Panhandle one in April, and I’m not really sure why,” she said. “But I think that’s been a burden, in some ways, for OSU. And I think it’s kind of been a slap in the face of the other campuses that they didn’t get to show off their campuses.”
Current regents don’t answer questions about spending
Harrel, a banker and rancher, did not return messages seeking comment. Stitt appointed the OSU graduate in 2020. 
Oklahoma Voice attempted multiple times to contact the 10 current and former board members who filed expense reports, but only Milner and Blayne Arthur, who also serves as the state’s agriculture commissioner, responded. Arthur’s office did not answer specific questions, but instead directed a reporter to the board’s chief executive officer, Jason Ramsey. Ramsey also did not answer specific questions about the spending but provided a statement. 
Regents are unpaid volunteers and their budget pays for their travel and lodging expenses, Ramsey said. 
Records show regents stayed at hotels such as the Atherton in Stillwater, the Mayo in Tulsa and the Ambassador in Oklahoma City. While records indicated they received discounted rates, the total cost of lodging topped over $6,000, according to records.
Records provided to Oklahoma Voice revealed that Ramsey also stayed in hotels, as did some staff. It wasn’t clear what the total cost was for the staff’s travel and lodging. The office lists an Oklahoma City address. 
The board rotates its meetings across the campuses it governs and the hosting institution’s president’s offices plan and budget the board meetings and related events, which can provide “engagement opportunities” with community leaders and other stakeholders, Ramsey said.
Burke, an OSU spokesperson, said it’s typical for presidents to host these activities at their own discretion, and they allow colleagues across the OSU A&M System to engage. The board does not request the extra events, Burke said. 
In many cases, “university facilities and catering services” are contracted to keep funds within the OSU System, Burke said.
Shrum, who headed the OSU system at the time of most of the meetings, did not respond to requests for comment. NEO, which spent over $4,000 on the meeting it hosted, also did not respond.
Politicians and observers react
Stitt, who has appointed all current members of the Oklahoma A&M Board of Regents and recently named his choice to replace Milner, said in a statement Friday that university presidents need to be “mindful of their spending.”

“University presidents are responsible for hosting the Board of Regents, and I get that these presidents want to showcase their campus and community,” he said in a statement. “But at the end of the day, I’m always going to urge the presidents to be mindful of their spending — because the last thing we need is higher tuition and constant requests for more recurring revenue.”
Gary Jones, a Republican, who previously served as state auditor, said he’s not sure that any of these expenses are in violation of state law, but the real test is how Oklahoma taxpayers respond. 
“Everyone has to look at and determine, you know, the circumstances. Who all is there, whether or not they’re being compensated in any other ways for the job,” he said. “If you take into consideration their time and effort and their expertise being volunteered to the state, the question is would most people consider a dinner or something like that, out of line?”
He said he wasn’t sure a dinner is out of line, but said alcoholic consumption could be viewed negatively.  
Rep. Ronny Johns, R-Ada, who serves on the House’s postsecondary education committee, said the spending is “concerning,” but that he didn’t know if it’s out of the ordinary. 
“As a regent, it’s almost a thankless job,” he said. “They do get reimbursed for the mileage and things, and that’s good. But there’s an argument to be said that it doesn’t have to be as extravagant, that there could be better ways to spend that money. But at the same time, when you have the regents on your campus you want to put your best foot forward and showcase your campus.”
But despite being concerned, Johns said he does not think the Legislature should step in and pass further regulations.
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, said regents need items like drinks and coffee, but should be cautious “in this environment” about what is considered reasonable when budgets are being scrutinized, she said. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
This is a public board, not a corporate one that represents a private company, she said. It should not be treated as such, Kirt said. 
Don Heider, chief executive of the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University in California, said there are many questions to weigh when evaluating these kinds of costs, including whether regents and university presidents are being “good stewards” of the taxpayer money with which they are entrusted. 
“And could the money be spent in a more efficient way on what they’re charged to do, which is overseeing these five universities?” he asked.",https://oklahomavoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/11555DF2-1BA0-4CF4-8742-E9411D38A90E_4_5005_c.jpeg,,,2025-04-04 18:07:06.076079

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Protests against U.S. President Donald Trump are planned for a dozen cities in New Mexico on Saturday, part of a mass mobilization effort at state capitals across the country and in Washington D.C.
The “Hands Off” demonstrations center around the message, “We do not consent to the destruction of our government and our economy for the benefit of Trump and his billionaire allies,” according to its website.
Rallies on Saturday will take place in Santa Fe, Ramah, Albuquerque, Taos, Gallup, Las Cruces, Portales, Socorro, Truth or Consequences, Los Lunas, Silver City and Alamogordo, according to a list of actions planned for New Mexico.
The Santa Fe action is being organized by Indivisible Santa Fe, a group of mostly women activists created in 2016 at the outset of the first Trump administration, and a chapter of larger Indivisible movement.
Santa Fe local Max Thurston, one of the co-organizers of the Santa Fe demonstration, told Source NM on Friday he joined the organization because he was looking for something meaningful to do in order to resist the Trump administration’s authoritarian attacks on immigrants, LGBTQ people and women’s rights, freedom of speech and the environment.
“You can feel really helpless and not that powerful when you’re looking at the news individually, so the whole idea of Indivisible is that it’s all about how we can organize, come together and resist this authoritarianism, fight for something we really believe in and fight for our values,” Thurston said.
Thurston, a researcher and PhD student in exercise science at the University of Jyväskylä in Finland, said he was particularly affected by the Trump administration’s funding cuts for research programs.
“For me, it’s also a pretty uncertain, difficult time because I really wanted to be a scientist here in the U.S., ideally in New Mexico,” he said. “I believe in scientific institutions and, in a lot of ways, I felt like America had some of the best science in the world and now I don’t know if that’s the case.”
Thurston said there are now thousands of rallies planned for Saturday, and his group is expecting millions of people to show up.
“I think it’s true of all of the different Hands Off rallies all across the state and across the country that the movement is about bringing together a lot of different groups, really building a strong coalition of different grassroots organizations focused on lots of different topics but that all have the same goal of standing up against the ways the Trump and Musk administration is dismantling our democracy, our government and our future,” Thurston said.
Speakers at the event in Santa Fe are expected to include U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.), Georgetown University law professor Heidi Li Feldman and EarthCare Co-Director Bianca Sapoci-Belknap.
The rally in Santa Fe is scheduled from noon to 2 p.m. on Saturday outside the New Mexico Legislature, on the east side of the Roundhouse.
Thurston said the Santa Fe rally will include people from the National Organization for Women’s local chapter, New Mexico Wild, the National Education Association’s New Mexico branch and the Democratic Party of New Mexico’s Veterans and Military Families Caucus.
The American Federation of Teachers New Mexico and Youth United for Climate Crisis Action have also sent out emails to supporters this week encouraging them to participate.
Thurston said organizers picked Saturday as the time for the protests in part because of the urgency to the harms being done by the Trump administration and the uncertainty about what happens next.
“We stand up on April 5 so that we can keep standing up on April 15, and on April 25, and keep this movement going,” he said. “This is definitely only the start.”

Extreme heat at a Miami-area prison without air conditioning has subjected prisoners to cruel and unusual punishment, according to a federal lawsuit filed in October by the Florida Justice Institute.
Nearly three quarters of Florida prisons lack air-conditioning, and that isn’t going to be resolved during the sitting legislative session. But a pilot program proposed in the pending Florida Senate’s budget bill would provide much-needed cooling in wings of several South Florida correction facilities that provide re-entry programs for inmates.


Specifically, the $300,00 appropriation would go towards air conditioning units in dorm rooms of institutions where Horizon Communities Corp. provides its Faith & Character program, which teaches basic life skills and faith principles to inmates in several prisons in Miami-Dade County.
The idea started with prison rights advocate Connie Edson, who has worked for five years to try to give inmates relief from the scorching Florida temperatures.

In 2022, she teamed with Gainesville Democratic Rep. Yvette Hinson to implement a pilot program that tested large portable evaporative coolers at Lowell Correctional Institution in Marion County, Florida’s largest state prison. The project ultimately ended, with Department Corrections Secretary Ricky Dixon telling a legislative committee in fall 2023 that they weren’t the solution.
“These portable units and some band-aid approaches we’ve tried … even the [inmate] population doesn’t like them,” he said, referring to the noise and moisture that they create.
But that hasn’t discouraged Edson, and over the past year she connected with Horizon executive director Nathan Schaidt to work with legislators on creating air-conditioning units in the dorms where Horizon provides instruction. The appropriation was offered by Miami-Dade Republican Ana Maria Rodriguez in the Senate and Republican Jim Mooney in the House, who represents Florida’s southernmost district encompassing parts of Miami-Dade and all of the Keys.
Older volunteers
Horizon relies heavily on volunteers who average between 60 and 80 years of age and who could contribute more if it weren’t so hot in those facilities, Schaidt said.

“The issue is that we don’t do that work in the chapel, we don’t do our work in education, we go down to the dorm where the men and women live. And so when you start hitting the summer months, a lot of our volunteers, they have to bow out. They can’t go and sit for two hours in that heat trying to teach these classes,” he said.
Schaidt compares what takes place on a regular basis at least eight months of the year to a college class in which the air-conditioning was broken on a specific day.
“What would they do?” he asks.”They’re probably going to cancel class. It’s very unlikely that they’re going to say, ‘Well, you paid for this and you need to sit through here, even though it’s a one-day thing and we’re working on the air conditioning but you need to be in class today.’ 
“We don’t have that option. They’re going to be there. And this isn’t just classes, this is their daily life, right? The issue we run into is, if you add to their inability to regulate their emotions to their inability to focus, their inability to sometimes learn and just the basic environment. Now add to that the heat. It’s a battle. It’s something that you’re fighting with over and over again.”
Since it was created in 1999, Schaidt said, Horizon has worked with thousands of men and women who have subsequently left the Florida prison system and boasts of a 5% recidivist rate. He says that if those inmates could study in a more comfortable environment with air-conditioning, those numbers might be even better.
Meanwhile, Edson has her fingers crossed that what she considers a relatively modest proposal will make it over the finish line when lawmakers unveil their 2025-2026 FY budget later this month.
A report by the global consulting firm KPMG that was released in the fall of 2023 put the costs to add air-conditioning to all of the state’s prisons at $582 million.

That’s according to a report from the division, highlighted Thursday by Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill, whose office is sharing resources and trying to increase awareness for Child Abuse Awareness Month this April.

According to data from the division, there were at least 8,791 confirmed victims of child abuse and neglect during the 2024 fiscal year, stemming from nearly 50,000 reports. Of those reports, about 22,650 met the criteria for a Child Protective Services investigation. 
At least 70% of the perpetrators were the victim’s parents, and an additional 16% were other relatives.
“Child abuse sees no economic nor political boundaries. It is a global problem that can only be addressed with community-level solutions,” Gill said in a statement Thursday.
In 2024 alone, Gill’s office filed 276 physical child abuse-related charges and 135 child sex abuse-related charges. Still, Gill said child abuse is often one of the most unreported crimes. 
Lawmakers passed a handful of bills this year aimed at prosecuting cases of child abuse, with bills increasing the penalties or widening the scope of current crimes to give prosecutors more tools. 
Lawmakers passed dozens of bills that add, increase, or enhance criminal penalties. Here’s a list.

That includes a bill that makes it easier to prosecute abuse that happens online, a bill that adds an aggravating factor if the child abuse is part of a ritual or religious ceremony, and a bill to increase the penalty for the most egregious cases, now defined as “child torture.” 
That last bill, SB24, targets “exceptionally cruel or exceptionally depraved” behavior that results in physical or psychological pain. If found guilty, the perpetrator could be charged with a third-degree felony punishable by a 10-year minimum sentence. 
The legislation was, in part, a result of the case of Norlin Cruz, a 6-year-old boy killed in 2019 after being subjected to what investigators said was the worst case of child abuse they’d ever seen. Cruz’s mother, Reyna Elizabeth Flores-Rosales, was convicted of reckless child abuse homicide, a first-degree felony, and three counts of second-degree felony child abuse. 
SB24, Gill’s office said in a news release, “came about as our office prosecuted the mother of Norlin Cruz.” Gill on Thursday spoke to reporters alongside a picture of Cruz, who he often refers to when talking about prosecuting crimes against children.

In his message, Capilouto wrote that the Department of Homeland Security notified UK that the department was revoking some F-1 student visas. The president didn’t specify the number of students affected but said it was a “small group.” He said university officials contacted the students to offer information and support.
“The university will always comply with the law,” Capilouto said. “We also will make abundantly clear that our more than 1,300 international students and scholars are valued members of this special community.”
UK is “working to understand changing federal policies” that are affecting campuses, Capilouto said. UK international students are encouraged to direct questions they may have to the university’s International Student and Scholars Services center. 
The news at the Kentucky university comes on the heels of the Trump administration’s efforts to ramp up deportations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week that the State Department has revoked 300 or more student visas.

So it is very abrupt,” said Heidi Drygas, director of the Alaska [&#8230;]","The offices of the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services are seen in Juneau on Friday, July 1, 2022. (Photo by Lisa Phu/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Department of Health abruptly laid off 30 public health employees this week after the federal government canceled a series of grants unexpectedly early.
“Their last day of employment is today, and they found out — I believe — earlier this week. So it is very abrupt,” said Heidi Drygas, director of the Alaska State Employees Association, the union that represents 22 of the 30 laid-off employees.
The layoffs are believed to be the first round of significant Alaska state-government job losses caused by President Donald Trump and the arm of the White House named the “Department of Government Efficiency,” coordinated by Elon Musk.
Trump-ordered cuts have already had significant effects on federal government programs and nongovernmental organizations that rely on federal grants, but until now, state-government jobs had been relatively protected.
“I fear that there are more (layoffs) coming,” Drygas said. “I’m worried that this is the tip of the iceberg, and this rapidly evolving news story … is causing a lot of anxiety for our members, many of whom work under federal grants, or they work on a daily basis with their federal counterparts. It’s hugely disruptive.”
Alex Huseman, a spokesperson for the Alaska Department of Health, said the federal government brought an early end to two major COVID-19 response grants.
Those grants had been expected to expire no later than 2027. The state’s current operating budget and Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s proposal for the coming year list millions of dollars in expected grant spending. 
“The amended notice of awards for the impacted grants now reflect an end date of March 24, 2025,” Huseman wrote by email. “The reductions in federal funding had an impact on 30 employees. The DOH is working with the Division of Personnel and the Rapid Response Team from the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, in accordance with the respective union contracts and regulations, to assist affected employees.”
Drygas said the affected positions are spread across the state, and that as with any job losses, these cuts will have ripple effects in the local communities, since state salaries lead to local spending.
“In some of these smaller communities, there’s not that many jobs, and so it could have a huge impact, or a disproportionate impact,” she said.

Jeff Thompson present the House Republican plan for property taxes on April 4, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Lawmakers introduced yet another plan for property taxes this week, pitching a proposal to save homeowners $1.1 billion over three years. 
In comparison, homeowners would have seen nearly $1.3 billion in relief in 2026 alone under Gov. Mike Braun’s previous proposal. 
In the atypical Friday afternoon press conference, Rep. Jeff Thompson said that 93-94% of homeowners would see lower property tax bills than they would with no action. But the majority of homeowners would pay less in 2026 than they did in 2025.
“We have two main goals in crafting this bill: deliver immediate relief to homeowners and reform the system to prevent the dramatic spikes in property taxes that we’ve seen in recent years,” said House Speaker Todd Huston. “Our amendment accomplishes both.”
  House Speaker Todd Huston, R-Fishers, on April 4, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
The amendment to Senate Bill 1, set to be introduced on Monday, isn’t yet publicly available. Once adopted by a committee, the Legislative Services Agency will release an estimated fiscal note.
According to the two Republican leaders, all homestead property tax bills will get a 7.5% credit in perpetuity, up to $200, based on a calculation performed after accounting for property tax caps. Fixed-income seniors will see an additional $150 credit while disabled veterans will get an additional $250 credit.
“Now, every single veteran and every single senior will get a benefit if they qualify,” said Thompson, R-Lizton.
But one of the biggest benefits for the average homeowner, Huston said, would be improved transparency for taxpayers, who would be able to assess their bills on a Property Tax Transparency Portal.
“When we do a rate-based and non-levy-based system … I think the normal Hoosier homeowner can understand what their bill looks like. It’s not some algebraic equation,” said Huston, R-Fishers.
The plan for property taxes joins a handful of other efforts, including one from Gov. Mike Braun, Senate Republicans, a House Democrat and a previous Thompson pitch. Each proposal has varying impacts to homeowners and local units of government, which rely on revenue from property taxes to fund public safety, infrastructure and schools. 
For instance, Braun’s plan would save homeowners the most money on their property taxes going forward but be a heavy hit to the budgets of school corporations, counties, cities and towns. Alternatively, plans that reduce that revenue loss have a small, nearly negligible impact on homeowner property taxes. 
 More details to come

It’s not yet clear what the total estimated impact of those credits will be to local governments. Thompson, the chief budget architect in the House, said most units will still see additional revenue but smaller increases than they would without Senate Bill 1.
“They’re still going to be gaining dollars. If I recall, it’s about a 5.6% gain (under) current law. This will roughly cut that down to a little over 3%,” Thompson said. “So they’re still adding more dollars, just not as many new dollars.”
But Huston cautioned that some units, depending on their circumstances, could see losses simply because of the “complexity of the system,” pointing to local referendums and debt.
Similarly homeowner tax bills vary significantly depending on a home’s value, the local tax rate and other factors. 
  Rep. Jeff Thompson, R-Lizton, on April 4, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
“You could have the same home in the same county  — and built in the same year — and you’d have two wildly different property taxes,” Huston said. “… I wish I could stand up here and give you all the bare bone specifics. I’d love to know what my property tax bill is going to look like in ‘26.”
The proposed amendment would also “rein in” locally held debt, though it’s not yet clear how the General Assembly would accomplish that. House Republicans reported that the state’s 2,000-plus local units of government hold a combined $53.4 billion in debt. 
Such calculations will impact local schools, who would get a double-whammy revenue hit with the incorporation of Senate Bill 518 into the plan for property taxes. The current version would require schools to split their revenue with certain charter schools. 
Under the new language for sharing property taxes, which isn’t yet available, Huston said changes for schools wouldn’t kick in until 2028 and would be phased in over four years.
Thompson also alluded to changes in the state’s personal business property tax, including a “very, very slow, gradual phase down” for purchases made after Jan. 1, 2025.
 

	Will it be enough?    

It’s uncertain whether the plan will be enough for the Hoosiers calling for relief. Last month, hundreds rallied to push lawmakers to adopt a plan closer to Braun’s proposal, pointing to tax jumps in recent years during the economic fallout of COVID-19.
Democratic Rep. Greg Porter said that big business would still be the winners in a Friday press release, criticizing the plan for not addressing home assessments that increase faster than business assessments.

“With roughly $1.1 billion saved over three years and about 1.9 million homesteads, each homeowner will save an average of close to $575 from 2026 to 2028,” Porter said in a statement. “… With an average property tax bill ranging from $1500 to $3000, a yearly credit of only $200 will fail to make a difference.”
He also denounced the lack of relief for renters as well as an increased reliance on local income taxes for municipalities to backfill losses.
“Our schools will lose money, especially with Senate Bill 518 rolled into the plan diverting property tax dollars to charter schools so the state can pay even less. This plan encourages local governments to raise their local income tax rate, so you’ll get more money in your right pocket but have to pay more out of your left,” Porter continued.
Braun threatened to veto earlier versions of the proposal, citing the need for homeowner relief. Still, Huston seemed comfortable with the current package.
“We feel very good about the trajectory that we’re on and we will continue to work with our partners on this and figure out where the best place to land the plane is,” said Huston.

[&#8230;]","Senate Bill 394 would allow first responders to receive workers compensation benefits if they are diagnosed with PTSD.A proposal to expand Montana workers’ compensation to include post-traumatic stress disorder drew significant debate in the Senate before ultimately passing a second reading, 29-20 to move on to the House.
Senate Bill 394, brought by Sen. Cora Neumann, D-Bozeman, would allow first responders to receive workers compensation benefits if they are diagnosed with PTSD. Much of the debate around the bill focused on its fiscal note and the potential for insurance companies to increase their rates. 
“When we pick up that phone and call 911, we expect these people to put their lives and their bodies and their families in harm’s way to keep us safe,” Neumann said. “This is the least we can do.”
The American Psychiatric Association defines PTSD as “a disorder that may result when an individual lives through or witnesses an event in which they believe that there is a threat to life or physical integrity and safety and experiences fear, terror, or helplessness.”
Neumann said Montana is one of a handful of states that do not have PTSD as part of its worker compensation legislation. 
Several members of the Senate shared personal stories about either themselves or family members dealing with traumatic events. Sen. Sue Vinton, R-Billings, told a story about her brother, who in 2012 was a volunteer firefighter in New York.
A man set fire to a house on Christmas Eve that year and when firefighters responded, he shot and killed two of them and injured two others. Her brother was called to the scene that day.
“Trust me when I tell you that my brother has PTSD,” Vinton said. “He cannot participate in family festivities on Christmas Eve anymore. He hasn’t been able to ever since then. It’s just a sad day. It’s a difficult day. And so I have seen this first hand.”
Opponents pointed to the fiscal note. The Montana State Fund did an analysis, which was included in the bill. The state fund estimates the change would add an additional $897,795 to the cost of the plan, though some of that would come from insurance carriers.
It was estimated by looking at other states that have passed similar legislation.
A technical concern was raised in the fiscal note as well, noting constitutional equal protection concerns as first responders would be in their own class.
“All other individuals are prohibited from such benefits for the same diagnosis,” the fiscal note read. “This would be true even if the non-first responder was diagnosed with PTSD based on events in the course and scope of employment.”
Opponents also questioned whether it was the state’s responsibility to provide help in this situation.
“I would remind the body that that’s not the government’s role to take care of everybody,” Majority Leader Tom McGillvray, R-Billings said. “I mean, government is not your mama, government is not your daddy.”
Sen. Barry Usher, R-Billings, who worked with Neumann on an amendment to the bill, mentioned the class issue. He supported the bill and the amendment removed correctional officers from workers compensation claims, which lowered the fiscal note.
“Somebody mentioned that, why should we do this for a special class of people,” Usher said. “I can tell you it takes a special class of person to actually go, like the last Senator said, and go back to fighting fires.  But I can also tell you that it’s embedded in these people’s hearts to run towards danger, jump between you and danger.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_5465-Edit-729x1024.jpg,,,2025-04-04 18:07:06.076079

Todd Young (R-IN) arrives prior to the Senate Republicans' weekly policy luncheon, in the US Capitol on March 25, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Al Drago/Getty Images)When President Donald Trump unveiled another, broader series of tariffs this week, he sent markets reeling — and sparked bipartisan legislative pushback featuring Indiana’s senior U.S. senator.
The changes stoked enthusiasm among most Republican officials representing Indiana in Congress, while Democratic representation spoke against them.
Trump introduced additional import taxes with fanfare Wednesday from the White House Rose Garden, dubbing it “Liberation Day.” He said it would “forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn,” States Newsroom’s national team reported.
He held up a list of “reciprocal” tariffs purporting to charge other nations half of what they charge the U.S. But they’re actually calculated based on trade deficits — which occur when a country imports more products from other countries than it sells to them — BBC News found.

The day after, a Washington state Democrat and an Iowa Republican introduced the “Trade Review Act of 2025,” to “reaffirm Congress’ key role in setting and approving U.S. trade policy” — and on Friday afternoon, Republican U.S. Sen. Todd Young of Indiana signed on as a cosponsor.
The president would have to notify Congress of new tariffs or tariff increases within 48 hours in order to enact them. The notice would have to include justification, plus an analysis of the potential impacts on American businesses and consumers. They’d expire within 60 days unless Congress passes a joint resolution of approval. And Congress could end the tariffs at any time.
Young previously said the Trump administration “rightly takes the view” that it’s time to push back on “provocative trade activity” in a Thursday statement to the Capital Chronicle.
“While tariffs can be a useful tool, they also carry downside risk if applied without a clear strategy — especially for Hoosier farmers and manufacturers who need certainty,” he said. “I’ve consistently emphasized the need for greater clarity in our trade approach so that those directly affected aren’t left in the dark.
He touted his Leveling the Playing Field 2.0 Act then added, “My hope is that these efforts — both the strategic pressure of tariffs and the enforcement tools in my legislation — can lead to negotiated outcomes that strengthen America’s position on trade and the economic prosperity of our country.”
It’s also consistent with Young’s views that Congress needs to avoid ceding key decisions to the executive branch.
GOP Second Congressional District Rep. Rudy Yakym also referenced potential challenges in a Friday statement to the Capital Chronicle.
“I am in close contact with Hoosier manufacturers, farmers, and the Administration on tariffs,” he said.
“Indiana’s Second District is the type of production economy President Trump wants to see across the country, and I look forward to passing pro-growth policies that increase manufacturing and jobs to ensure our shared goal of a level playing field,” Yakym continued.
Full-throated support from others
But most of Indiana’s congressional delegation offered passionate support for the president’s tariffs.
“The days of other countries ripping off America and our workers are OVER,” Republican U.S. Sen. Jim Banks of Indiana wrote on X Wednesday. “Thanks to President Trump, it’s America First from here on out.”
Indiana Ninth District Congresswoman Erin Houchin, also a Republican, wrote the country has been “ripped off” for decades and that Trump is “rewriting global trade policy in America’s favor.”
Banks, meanwhile, celebrated when General Motors announced Thursday that it would increase production in Indiana.
“It hasn’t even been 24 hours and President Trump’s plan is already delivering for working families in Indiana in a big way,” Banks said in a statement posted to X.
Indiana GOP Third District Congressman Marlin Stutzman was also enthusiastic, writing, “The Trump Tariff Equation: Free trade + Fair trade = LIBERATION.” Stutzman, a cattle farmer, further applauded tariffs on Australian beef.

And as stocks plunge and economists fret, the Hoosier delegation has presented staunch defenses of the president’s tactics.
In response to gloomy predictions of higher prices and slower growth from the Federal Reserve, Indiana Fifth District Republican Rep. Victoria Spartz pinned the blame on former President Joe Biden’s administration — plus, “serious dependencies of our supply chain on foreign countries.”
“Congresswoman Spartz is working with President Trump and her congressional colleagues to grow our economy, boost domestic investments and diversify our supply chain dependencies,” spokesman J.P. Etchison wrote to the Capital Chronicle.
Democratic denunciation
The Seventh Congressional District’s Rep. André Carson, a Democrat, struck a different tone in his own statement about last month’s foreign-made vehicle tariffs.
“I support lower costs for Hoosiers, but these tariffs will likely jack up the price of new vehicles and used cars,” Carson said. “Automakers are already recovering from years of instability after the pandemic, and these tariffs will only create more complications.”
He said Trump’s first-term tariff attempts “didn’t work” and urged the president to “reconsider for the well-being of all Americans.”
U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan, also a Democrat, didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Neither did Republican Reps. Jefferson Shreve and Mark Messmer didn’t reply to requests for comment, while Rep. Jim Baird couldn’t be reached.

The individuals, who were charged with conspiring to launder money extorted from boys and young men using sexually sensitive images by Nigerian criminals, were all Americans.
After the sextortionists coerced the victims into sending the images, they would extort them for money that was sent to the five U.S.-based money launderers through online payment systems, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Western District of Michigan. The five launderers would take their cut, 20%, and send the rest to a Nigerian individual they referred to as “The Plug”, who took a cut and sent the rest to the extortionists themselves.
But when the extortionists couldn’t get victims to send money, they would demand other things. This was the case for 17-year-old Marquette Senior High School student Jordan DeMay.
In 2022, in a matter of six hours, the Nigerian extortionists managed to extort sexual images from the teen and convince him to kill himself if he didn’t comply with their demands.
“He was tragically tortured,” DeMay’s father John DeMay said during a news conference to bring awareness to the issue of sextortion in 2024. “He was convinced and groomed into sending an explicit picture of himself, which he did and when that happened, the extortion started. It was vicious, it was consistent, it was methodical and it was purposeful.”



The launderers who pleaded include:
Dinsimore Guyton Robinson, 29, of Huntsville, Alabama
Kendall Ormond London, 32, of Lithonia, Georgia
Brian Keith Coldmon, Jr., 30, of Peachtree Corners, Georgia
Jarell Daivon Williams, 31, of McDonough, Georgia 
Johnathan Demetrius Green, 32, of Stone Mountain, Georgia



The conspiracy offense carries a 20-year maximum prison sentence.
In recent months, Andrew Birge, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Michigan, has brought attention to the problem of sextortion in the modern age, noting that it too often can result in tragedy, like in Jordan DeMay’s case.
And in reflecting on the launderers’ role in this sextortion scheme, Birge said in a news release that “these individuals helped and profited from this awful, heartbreaking scheme and so they now will face the consequences.”
The Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation have been calling attention to the emerging threat of sexual violence online being perpetrated by utilizing sexually sensitive images to extort victims, also known as “sextortion”.

Measles symptoms can take one to three weeks to develop, but people can spread the virus even before symptoms develop.
(iStock / Getty Images Plus)The New Mexico Department of Health on Friday reported measles cases had grown to 54, six more since the previous report on Tuesday.
According to a news release, all but two of the cases are in Lea County, with the remaining two in Eddy County, and most are among unvaccinated residents. NMDOH said the state’s measles situation “is not a rapidly expanding outbreak,” but, rather, one in which cases have “been occurring steadily over time.”
Measles, a highly contagious virus, can be transmitted by someone four days before and after the onset of the rash. Moreover, in enclosed spaces, the virus can stay in the air for two hours after an infected person has left the space. Symptoms begin with: a cough, runny nose and eye redness before progressing to fever and rash, the latter of which starts on the head before spreading down the body.
Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccines, health officials say, provide lifetime protection, and are 93% effective with one dose and 97% effective with two.
Between Feb. 1 and April 3 of this year, 15,718 New Mexicans have received the MMR vaccine, which is nearly double the 8,472 MMR vaccinations administered during the same period last year.
“We are grateful for the response New Mexicans have had in getting their measles vaccination over these last two months,” NMDOH Chief Medical Officer Dr. Miranda Durham said in a statement. “Without it, measles outbreaks are more likely to last longer and increase over time.”



People experiencing fever and rash should contact their doctors or emergency departments in advance so they can plan for your visit.

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)A Plaquemines Parish jury has ruled that Chevron Corp. must pay the local government more than $740 million, blaming the fossil fuel company for decades of damage to its wetlands.
The ruling is the first among several lawsuits from coastal parishes in Louisiana that want the oil and gas industry to compensate them for carving up swamps and marshland. Local officials contend the vast work related to energy exploration and pipelines has gradually exacerbated the natural depletion of coastal areas, making them less effective barriers against hurricanes.
Chevron has said it intends to appeal the ruling. It’s among several companies from which Louisiana parishes are seeking billions in damages for coastal land loss.   
“Chevron is not the cause of the land loss occurring in Breton Sound,” Mike Phillips, the company’s lead attorney in the case, said in a statement, adding that it plans to appeal the ruling 
Attorney John Carmouche, who’s representing several parishes in their lawsuits against the energy industry, has argued the defendant companies have failed to follow state law that requires them clean and restore sites as close as possible to their original state. Chevron and others maintain the law doesn’t apply to activity that took place before it was enacted in 1978. 
The jury’s award in the 12-year-old case is far less than the $2.6 billion Plaquemines Parish was seeking in the lawsuit, although interest will take the final award above $1.2 billion, according to Carmouche. 
Chevron also contests that figure.
The ruling in Plaquemines Parish has broader political implications in a state where oil and gas have long been an economic staple and a revenue source for government. Even when commodity prices drop, demand wanes or international  pressures affect how much Louisiana pockets from drilling, fossil fuel continues to be held in high regard by those in power.
But these so-called legacy lawsuits from nearly every coastal parish against Big Oil have impacted this dynamic to a degree.
Carmouche, who forced Freeport-McMoran to reach a $100 million settlement with 12 parishes in 2019, helped bankroll the campaign of Democrat John Bel Edwards for governor in 2015 and his re-election in 2019.
Current Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican, also saw significant contributions from Carmouche and trial lawyers in his 2023 election victory. As attorney general, Landry chose to allow parishes to pursue their lawsuits against fossil fuel companies.
Landry also tapped Carmouche for a seat on the politically powerful LSU Board of Supervisors last year.
This is a developing story that will be updated.

Jeff Landry is considering Bruce Greenstein, for health secretary of Louisiana. Greenstein is pictured here with former Vice President Mike Pence and President Donald Trump. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Gov. Jeff Landry might put a former Louisiana agency leader who was charged with lying to a grand jury under oath back in his old position overseeing billions of dollars at the Louisiana Department of Health. 
The Republican governor is vetting Bruce Greenstein, who also worked for President Donald Trump, to become Louisiana’s health secretary for a second time, according to multiple people familiar with conversations taking place. In the position, Greenstein would oversee Louisiana’s $21.4 billion health care budget, including its $19 billion Medicaid program. 

Greenstein first served as health secretary under former Gov. Bobby Jindal from 2010-13. He resigned after Jindal discovered the federal government was investigating Greenstein’s role in the award of a nearly $200 million state Medicaid contract to Greenstein’s previous employer, Client Network Services Inc. (CNSI). 
Despite the investigation, the federal government never brought charges against Greenstein, and the former health secretary was never convicted of a crime, even after being indicted by a state grand jury. He repeatedly denied wrongdoing at the time. 
Five people who work for Louisiana’s health care industry told the Illuminator that Landry was seriously considering Greenstein for the health secretary job. At least four had knowledge of conversations taking place amongst the governor’s staff or state health department officials. They spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern that they could face retribution from Landry. 
The Landry administration declined Friday to answer questions about Greenstein, who could not be reached through his cellphone or text messages for comment.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX 
Greenstein would be an attractive hire for Landry because he has intimate knowledge of public health care financing, particularly Medicaid, and is well liked despite his legal troubles. Many people in Landry’s administration do not have long-term experience in health care accounting, federal Medicaid regulations or the state budget. 
On Friday, even Jindal praised Landry for considering Greenstein for the job. 
“Bruce would be a great choice. He has a great mix of private sector, federal and state experience. He would hit the ground running, and not need on the job training,” Jindal said in a written statement. “He would work tirelessly to improve health outcomes and control costs.” 
The former governor did not address the controversy surrounding Greenstein when he suddenly left the Jindal administration over a decade ago. 
While the federal government didn’t pursue a case, then-Attorney General Buddy Caldwell convened a state grand jury that indicted Greenstein in 2014. He was charged with nine counts of perjury for allegedly lying to a Louisiana Senate committee and the grand jury about the Medicaid contract. 
Those state charges against Greenstein were eventually dropped by Landry after he beat Caldwell in the 2015 election and took over as attorney general, a job Landry held for eight years before becoming governor. 
At the time, Landry’s staff said they didn’t think the state could meet the burden of proof to convict Greenstein. The prosecutor on the case, Caldwell’s son, David, left the attorney general’s office shortly after Landry beat his father in the election. 
CNSI, which changed its name to Acentra Health after a merger in 2023, also gave Landry’s campaign and a Landry political action committee $52,500 during his race against Caldwell, according to campaign finance reports. 
Greenstein, who pleaded not guilty in the state perjury case, initially said he had very little contact with CNSI as the company bid for Louisiana’s Medicaid business. But an investigation later revealed Greenstein had exchanged hundreds of messages with its executives. He also recommended state officials adjust the terms of the state Medicaid bid, which allowed CNSI to meet the criteria and apply for the work. 
At the time, Greenstein defended himself by saying his exchanges with CNSI executives were mostly personal and that he never took a bribe from the company. He’s good friends with some of his former CNSI coworkers, and the conversations were casual, he said.

“It never crossed my mind that my friends or my texts were with a company,” Greenstein told a grand jury in late 2014. 
After the charges were dropped, Greenstein went on to join President Donald Trump’s administration as the chief technology officer at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

In 2018, he left the federal government to become an executive at LHC Group, a Lafayette business that was, at the time, one of the country’s largest home health care companies. The company has since been sold to UnitedHealth, a national insurance company that also manages one of Louisiana’s Medicaid plans. 
LHC Group’s founder and chief executive officer emeritus, Keith Myers, is one of the biggest political donors to Landry, with contributions totaling more than $600,000 to his campaigns and PACs since 2017. Brach Myers, Keith’s son and another executive at LHC, is a state senator representing Lafayette. 
Though he was never convicted of a crime, Greenstein’s legal troubles cost Louisiana money years after he left state government. 
Independent of the grand jury investigation, Jindal canceled Louisiana’s contract with CNSI in 2013 on the grounds that Greenstein had inappropriate contact with the company during the state bid process. This resulted in CNSI suing Louisiana for wrongful termination, a legal dispute that dragged on for years until former Gov. John Bel Edwards settled with the company in 2016.
Before the case was settled, CNSI’s attorneys had sought depositions from several members of the Jindal administration, including now-Attorney General Liz Murrill.

When the CNSI contract was canceled, Murrill was the general counsel for Jindal’s commissioner of administration, Kristy Nichols, and involved in the decision to give CNSI the boot. 

Yet Landry has relied on Greenstein for advice on health care policy since before he become governor. Greenstein was one of 28 members on Landry’s health care advisory council after he won the gubernatorial election in 2023.  
If Landry appoints Greenstein to be health secretary, he will have to be confirmed by the Louisiana Senate to hold the position permanently during lawmakers’ upcoming session that starts April 14.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Greenstein-Pence-Trump-1024x743.jpg,,,2025-04-04 18:07:06.076079

The change came after lawmakers unveiled plans to pass a bill establishing a universal no-phone policy for all Utah public schools.
That new policy is set to extend to schools across Utah, as a new law that bans students from using cellphones, smart watches or other emerging technology devices during classroom hours will take effect  July 1. 
A cellphone ban in Utah schools is closer to reality with overwhelming support in Legislature

In a ceremonial signature event for three tech safety bills, Cox, who has championed efforts to lower social media usage, especially among teens, said the bills have the potential to redefine the online landscape, not only in Utah but in the country. 
“I remember getting criticism two years ago for our first social media bills, that we were trying to be a nanny state, to take power away from parents. And it’s the exact opposite,” Cox said on Friday. “What we are trying to do is to give parents and families back the power over these destructive and corrosive apps and cellphones.”
During the event, Cox and Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson ceremoniously signed SB178, the bill that establishes a statewide cellphone ban policy — unless any school board decides otherwise. They also signed HB418, which directs social media companies to have a common data infrastructure, and SB142, a legislation that would require Google and Apple to verify the ages of their customers before they make app store purchases. 
With these new laws, Cox said, the state is aiming to empower Utahns in the online world, which he said is going in a worse direction with artificial intelligence providing even more tools to expand social media’s addictive qualities. 
“It’s not just the anxiety, depression and self harm that I mentioned,” Cox said. “But it’s literally tearing us apart and the fabric of our country. It’s making us hate each other as we get addicted to the outrage that is out there.”

A cellphone ban is not done
Sponsored by Sen. Lincoln Fillmore, R-South Jordan, SB178 sets a statewide policy that prohibits students from using their cellphone during school hours. A few schools in Utah had policies banning cellphones, but Utah law didn’t set a default policy, which,Fillmore argued, was itself a policy through inaction that allowed electronic devices.
“(Constant notifications) turn school into, ‘I am constantly under the fear of missing out on what is going on in the virtual world apart from me, I’m surrounded by my peers and friends
in what is the most formative time in my life, and I’m focused on Taylor Swift,’” Fillmore said.
The bill does allow school districts to implement their own phone policies. An earlier proposal initially sought $4.8 million in one-time money to fund equipment, such as magnetic locking pouches for the phones or other types of lockers to store phones during class time. 



Let us know what you think...


 


However, lawmakers ultimately did not appropriate any money for the bill, with legislators expressing little appetite to pay for the equipment.
While the bill still allows some flexibility for local school officials to set their own rules, Cox said it’s one of the most important education policies approved in the state in the last decade. But, he said there’s still some room for improvement.
“We didn’t get ‘bell to bell’ here,” he said about other policies in other states that forbid phones during the whole school day. “I just can’t let this moment pass to say it is a mistake not to do ‘bell to bell.’ All of the research is 100% clear that ‘bell to bell’ does protect our kids so much more than going to recess and getting on your phones, going to lunch and immediately being back on your phones. So I hope we are not done here.”

An unprecedented change for platforms
Cox said Rep. Doug Fiefia, R-Herriman, made quite an impression for passing an unprecedented bill as a freshman.
With HB418, Utah became the first state in the nation to adopt a law requiring social media platforms to have interoperability systems, meaning having the necessary infrastructure so customers can communicate and share data from different platforms, just like how cellphone companies allow users from different carriers to call each other and carry their phone numbers even if they switch companies.
Utah’s latest data and social media laws could ‘change the world,’ Gov. Cox says

“It’s a shifting point. It is the turning point. It’s a moment in history where we choose people over platforms, families over profits, the greater good over an unchecked algorithm. It’s where we shift power back to where it always should remain, with the people with Utah”, Fiefia said about his bill.
Cox, who had already described the legislation as one with the potential “to change the world,” praised the bill again on Friday.
“I don’t think most people understand how groundbreaking this bill is. It is the first of its kind in the country,” Cox said. “And it really does have the potential to change everything, to break up the monopolies, to give us, again, back our identity.”
The bill takes effect in July 2026, which Fiefia said gives companies time to figure out how to achieve interoperability.

Age verification in app stores
Any first-year law school student learns that children can’t legally sign contracts, said Sen. Todd Weiler, R-Woods Cross, who sponsored SB142, titled App Store Accountability Act. However, every time a minor downloads or updates an app, they are accepting binding terms and conditions. 
“You might say, ‘big deal,’” Weiler said on Friday. “Well, these contracts … often (give) permission to collect their data, sometimes to access their microphone, even their cameras, to use their data, to sell their data.”
His bill isn’t about controlling content, Weiler added. It’s about contracts. 
The bill mostly applies to Apple and Google, which run the country’s two major app stores. Under the law, with some provisions set to become effective in May, the app stores will be required to collect guardians’ information, who will then allow any identified minor to download an app requiring a terms of service agreement.
Meta, X and Snap issued a joint statement supporting the legislation saying, “parents want a one-stop shop to verify their child’s age and grant permission for them to download apps in a privacy-preserving way.” 
However, Kareem Ghanem, director of public policy at Google, one of the companies that will bear the responsibility to verify ages, said in a blog post that a series of legislative proposals pushed by Meta “introduce new risks to the privacy of minors, without actually addressing the harms that are inspiring lawmakers to act.”
Weiler’s bill, Ghanem said, opens up the potential for bad actors to sell the data or use it for other “nefarious purposes.”
“This level of data sharing isn’t necessary — a weather app doesn’t need to know if a user is a kid. By contrast, a social media app does need to make significant decisions about age-appropriate content and features,” Ghanem wrote. “As written, however, the bill helps social media companies avoid that responsibility despite the fact that apps are just one of many ways that kids can access these platforms.”

(Main photo by Getty Images; logo courtesy State of Iowa)A central Iowa social worker accused of threatening his former employer with “revenge” and some form of an “attack” is now facing sanctions for alleged abuse and practicing while intoxicated.
The Iowa Board of Behavioral Professionals has charged Dakota Funk, 33, of Independence with practicing in a professional relationship while intoxicated and under the influence of alcohol; failing to maintain sufficient, timely, and accurate documentation in client records; physically or verbally abusing a client or colleague; and being convicted of an offense that directly relates to the duties and responsibilities of the profession.
The board has not publicly disclosed any of the alleged conduct that gave rise to the charges other than to say it occurred while Funk was practicing in Ankeny.
A hearing on the matter is scheduled for April 28.
Court records indicate that in August 2023, Funk was charged with, and later convicted of, harassment. Police alleged he “sent threatening emails” to the BrownWinick law firm to harass or intimidate the recipients, and that he continued to do so after being contacted by police.
A week later, Funk was again charged with, and later convicted of, harassment. In their report, police wrote that Funk had recently been fired from Central Iowa Psychological Services and that he was then sent a cease-and-desist letter by the BrownWinick law firm, which was representing CIPS, due to harassing emails he had allegedly been sending his former colleagues.
In one of his emails, Funk was alleged to have told the recipients, “You are both stupid. Go ahead and put a no-trespass on me. It won’t stop me (from) getting revenge on anyone. I take my time. Be careful 10 years from now! Because I plan my attacks!”
Four months later, Funk was charged with assault. Police alleged that when Funk was being admitted to Broadlawns Medical Center on Dec. 5, 2023, he kicked a nurse in an incident that was captured on video. Funk later pleaded guilty to a charge of disorderly conduct and was sentenced to five days in jail.
Two months after that incident, in February 2024, Funk was charged with, and later convicted of, domestic abuse assault. In that case, police alleged Funk assaulted his husband while heavily intoxicated. He was sentenced to one year of probation.
A few weeks after that incident, Funk was charged with, and later convicted of, violating a no-contact order by sending text messages to the victim in the assault case. That charge led to Funk’s probation being revoked and he was sentenced to 30 days in jail.
Court records indicate Funk has two drunken-driving convictions, one from 2019 and one from 2023. In both cases, Funk was arrested after police alleged he ran his car off the road while intoxicated.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/therapist.jpg,,,2025-04-04 17:03:08.411647

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Yellowbud hickory trees are abundant in Iowa’s forests, yet few make use of the trees’ bitter-tasting nuts. 
Levi Geyer, owner of Fancy Twig Farm, is one of a small handful of producers in the country foraging, crushing and extruding oil from the nuts as a sustainable, locally sourced cooking oil option.
Geyer said modern farming is eroding the soil, polluting water, contributing to a lack of biodiversity and is not environmentally sustainable. “But hickory trees can be grown in ways that are compatible with sustainable landscape,” Geyer said. “I’m harvesting these nuts from forests … there’s no inputs, there’s no tillage, so far there’s no fertilizer.”
Making yellowbud hickory oil
Geyer’s process is labor intensive. 
From foraging the nuts to putting the caps on the bottles, he estimates 8-10 hours of labor go into each bottle. Plus, Geyer has spent years scouting out good nut-bearing trees and forming relationships with folks who don’t mind the occasional scavenger. 
On a recent sunny Saturday afternoon, Geyer hosted an open house to thank the area landowners who allow him to forage for nuts on their properties. 
One of those landowners, Clarice Faber, said she is amazed that Geyer is “willing to work so hard for a new product.” 
As evidence, her husband, Bob Faber, pulled up his phone with a video of Geyer during hickory harvest season, high up in a yellowbud hickory, shaking the tree limbs to encourage the nuts to drop.
  Levi Geyer served scoops of vanilla ice cream topped with his Fancy Twig hickory oil and crushed shagbark hickory nuts, to show off the flavor of the foraged nut oil. (Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)
Geyer has had some success using a tractor-attached tree shaker, but said it really only works under perfect circumstances where a tree is isolated enough that a tractor can fit in next to the tree. 
The same goes for more traditional nut rakes — they don’t really work to gather nuts in a wild, unkempt area, which is mostly where he forages. Geyer’s harvesting tools consist of his hands and a low crouch to gather the felled nuts into buckets and plastic totes.
Once the nuts are gathered and sorted, Geyer runs them through a machine to remove the outer, green husks. Geyer built the husker out of a barrel, rubber fingers from a chicken plucker and some screws in the bottom that crack through the husks. 
Then the nuts move into a grain bin to dry out. 
This is another innovation by Geyer who said the small group of hickory oil producers across the country share knowledge with one another as they develop the trade. He said others use drying racks for this process, but now a couple of them hope to try out his grain-bin method. 
  Levi Geyer shows the grain bin he uses to dry the yellowbud hickory nuts. Last year the grain bin was nearly filled with 500 gallons of the husked nuts. (Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)
Once the nuts have dried, he crushes them, checks again for any “bad nuts,” and then sends them through the oil press. 
The bitternuts, as they are often called, are the only hickory variety that Geyer said can “easily be cracked with your teeth.” The thinner shell can also go through the oil press, which saves Geyer the tedious labor of shelling the nuts. 
Other native hickory varieties, like shagbark and shellbark, are tasty to eat, but have much thicker shells and don’t carry nearly as much oil.
With his current setup, Geyer said he gets one gallon of oil for every 15 gallons of nuts. 
The final step before bottling is a centrifuge process to help remove any impurities in the oil. 
“This is the freshest, highest quality oil you’ll ever get,” Geyer said.
He described the hickory oil flavor as “rich and delicate at the same time.” 
There is little research on the health benefits of hickory oil, although early settlers believed it could cure rheumatism.

Future plans 
Geyer said this is his first “big year.” He gathered and pressed enough nuts to make 76 gallons of oil, which he plans to sell at farmers markets in Iowa City and Kalona. 
“As a farmer, I see my role as supplying staple foods to people in urban areas,” Geyer said.
He hopes to grow the business, but not just in terms of what he can bottle. Geyer said he sees hickory oil as a way for consumers to become part of the local food system. 
“Another problem we have is people being disconnected from their food,” Geyer said. “The other part of the vision I have is for people to go out, harvest their own nuts and bring them to me and I’ll press them.” 
He said this would make the product, currently sold at a premium, more accessible for lower-income families. 
“I want hickory oil to be something that people can access and use for their main food source,” Geyer said. “You take your family out and you harvest nuts for a day or two and then that’s all the oil you need for the year.” 
Yellowbud hickories are most easily identified by their fancy twigs, tipped with bright yellow buds. 
The trees are found in the eastern half of the country, including most of Iowa. The best time to collect is from September through November, when the trees start to drop the nuts.

Geyer said he forages on about 10 different properties and several public land areas where he has scouted for the yellowbuds. 
“Anytime I go to a wooded area I find at least a couple,” he said. “They’re very common.” 
Geyer has also learned about the nut trade from Kathy Dice and Tom Wahl at Red Fern Farm in Wapello. He has worked at the duo’s u-pick chestnut, persimmon and paw paw farm for several years. 
Dice said in his off time Geyer would search for the yellowbuds on neighboring public lands and forage what he could. “We’re so impressed with the work he’s doing,” Dice said. 
Geyer wants Fancy Twig to be as sustainable as possible. 
His long term goal is to run the operation without any fossil fuels. He’s also in talks with a tannery to see if the byproduct of the pressed nuts, which is full of bitter tasting tannins, could be useful in tanning hides.
Geyer recently received a grant from Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education, or SARE, to explore different forest management techniques. Over the next year he plans to thin and clear certain forest areas of non-native brush and overgrowth through grazing, controlled burns and mowing, all of which will benefit the forest and nut production. 
He hopes to one day have a farm to plant yellowbud hickories and other species, but he still enjoys what he can produce as a forager. 
“For now, I haven’t reached the limits of what I can just find,” Geyer said. “And I’m still developing the processes.”

Aaron Dana testifies in support of prohibiting eminent domain on tribal lands before the Judiciary Committee on April 4. (Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)A bipartisan group of lawmakers presented legislation on Friday to prevent the state from being able to seize Wabanki land for public use without consultation.
For the past several Legislative sessions, leaders of the Wabanaki Nations have worked with lawmakers to try to overhaul the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act that has resulted in the tribes being treated more akin to municipalities than sovereign nations.  
So far, sweeping change has failed due to opposition from Gov. Janet Mills, but the executive, lawmakers and Wabanaki leaders have successfully made some targeted adjustments, including expanding tribal authority to prosecute crimes last year. 
LD 958 represents the next area of focus, although an omnibus bill is still expected to be considered during the second regular session of the Legislature next year. 
Sponsored by House Minority leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor) and bipartisan co-sponsors, LD 958 would amend the Settlement Act and the 2023 Mi’kmaq Nation Restoration Act — as the Mi’kmaq Nation hadn’t been included in the earlier act — to prohibit eminent domain, a protection already afforded to almost all other federally recognized tribes. 
“Much of our land contains irreplaceable cultural, spiritual and ecological resources,” said Passamaquoddy Tribal Rep. Aaron Dana, a co-sponsor of the bill who sits on the Judiciary Committee. “This bill ensures those places are safeguarded and are not subject to destruction or appropriation. Too often in our history, our tribal lands have been taken, divided and exploited under the guise of progress.”
The U.S. government can seize private property for public use, known as eminent domain, however that authority is restricted by the Fifth Amendment U.S. Constitution, which requires just compensation for land taken, as well as some federal laws.
Rep. Rachel Henderson (R-Rumford), a co-sponsor who sits on the Judiciary Committee, questioned whether the bill is in conflict with the Constitution. It is not, Faulkingham, tribal leaders and attorneys explained, because the Constitution outlines when eminent domain can be exercised but not that it can’t be further restricted. 
“There’s nothing in the Fifth Amendment that prohibits a state from enacting laws that says we won’t do that,” Faulkingham said. 
LD 958 applies to land protected under federal law — trust and reservation land — but fee lands — private property for which the owner owns the title — would still be subject to state power of eminent domain. A constitutional amendment allows states to condemn individually owned plots within tribal reservations.
Maine has seized Wabanaki land from the start of their intertwined histories, as the state territory today had first been inhabited by the Wabanaki people.
One example of eminent domain those who testified in favor of the bill cited occurred in 1925, when Maine took land from the Passamaquoddy Tribe’s Reservation at Sipayik to build Route 190 without tribal input. 
In 1912, the state helped a paper company pursue building a dam in Grand Falls, which flooded 6,000 acres of Passamoody land and harmed native fish, said William Nicholas, chief of the Passamoquoddy Tribe at Indian Township.
“When we talk about the Constitution of the United States and how it affects all of us, the Passamoquoddy Tribe is still waiting for our compensation for 113 years,” Nichols said, referring to the impact of the dam. 
Since the 1980 Act, Nichols said he views the state’s efforts to build an offshore wind port as an example of attempted eminent domain. Though the effort has been effectively put on hold, Nichols criticized the state for not consulting the tribes when pursuing a “possible invasion of our ancestral waters.”
Maulian Bryant, executive director of the Wabanaki Alliance, a nonprofit created in 2020 to advocate for the recognition of the Wabanaki Nations’ inherent sovereignty, said the bill encourages collaboration, not conflict. 
“If a project can truly benefit the public, the State and the Tribes, the state should work with tribal leaders to find a solution,” Bryant said. “This legislation is a protective measure to guarantee consultation and mutual agreement before any action is taken on tribal lands.”
There is one component of the bill Wabanki leaders are advocating to amend. 
The bill stipulates how the money received for seized land has to be reinvested and how the Tribes can reacquire land with such proceeds, which Passamaquoddy attorney Corey Hinton criticized as a paternalistic process.
“It puts an unnecessary restriction on a federal process,” Hinton said. 
Tribal attorneys will be presenting proposed changes to the committee before the work session on Wednesday. The change will likely be to strike the language and simply point to the federal takings process. 
Prohibiting eminent domain has unique bipartisan support, as some of the Republican co-sponsors of the bill previously voted against omnibus sovereignty legislation and piecemeal changes considered in past sessions.
Faulkingham described the bill as consistent with his political ideology, describing it as a measure to protect private property rights. 
“I don’t believe in the process of eminent domain against anybody, anywhere,” Faulkingham said. 
Other co-sponsors include Republican Sen. Marianne Moore of Washington, Democratic Rep. James Dill of Old Town and Republican Reps. Jennifer Poirier of Skowhegan, Katrina Smith of Palermo, Elizabeth Caruso of Caratunk and Arthur Kevin Mingo of Calais.
Other piecemeal changes to the Settlement Act so far include establishing a formal Tribal-State collaboration process for policy making, allowed the Tribes to generate sales tax revenue from sales on their own lands — except for the Mi’kmaq Nation, though lawmakers are hoping to expand that ability to them with a bill this session —  and permitting the Tribes to handle sports betting. 
Another bill this session supported by Wabanaki leaders would allow the Tribes to expand gambling options through internet gaming, with 16% of revenue generated going back to the state to fund services such as substance use disorder and gambling addiction programs. But casinos in Maine are opposed, arguing such a change would allow the Wabanaki Nations to monopolize the industry.

With a court-ordered deadline looming, officials are backing a multi-pronged plan to recruit more attorneys and reduce the backlog of unrepresented clients.
After years of Maine failing to provide timely counsel to defendants who can’t afford an attorney, the Kennebec County Superior Court ruled last month that the state must create a plan by April 3 to end what it described as a constitutional crisis. It also agreed to a request from the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine to start releasing defendants who have been waiting for counsel from incarceration if the state fails to provide representation. 
The ACLU of Maine has argued since 2022 that the state is in violation of the Sixth Amendment, which declares the right to a speedy and public trial and legal counsel, among other provisions.
With that deadline looming, the Maine Commission on Public Defense Services released its proposal Thursday, which includes immediate remedies such as better coordination with courts to keep an updated list of all defendants in need of an attorney, increased incentives for private and public attorneys to take on cases, and an appeal to district attorneys and the Maine Attorney General’s office to reconsider pursuing lower-level offenses, such as charges for drug possession or violating conditions of release (which make up the vast majority of charges).
As part of its long-term solutions, the commission also referenced a bill (LD 1101) passed by the Maine Legislature’s Judiciary Committee this week that would add five new positions within the public defenders offices..
Zach Heiden from the ACLU said at the public hearing on the bill that while it was critical in bolstering the state’s public defenders offices, it was not enough.
‘All hands on deck situation’
On Monday, the Kennebec County Superior Court will start setting dates to determine if people should be released, and what the conditions of release should be (for example, an ankle monitor, limits to travel, drug testing, etc.) 
Individuals who have been incarcerated for more than 14 days without counsel are eligible and if the judge decides a person should be released, the state will get another seven days to find an attorney before that actually happens, so a person could technically be incarcerated for a minimum of 21 days before release, according to the ACLU.
During the March 19 public hearing, Judiciary Committee co-chair Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland), who introduced the emergency legislation, described the need to urgently address the indigent defense crisis in Maine as an “all hands on deck situation.”
“I think there are two really big things at stake. One is the Sixth Amendment rights of these people who have been incarcerated, some of them for a very long time, without representation” she said.
“And the other thing at stake is really the rights of Mainers to live in a safe community. And in some instances, there are people who could be released from incarceration who would present a public safety threat.”
As an emergency measure, the bill will need the support of two-thirds of the Legislature to pass and immediately take effect. In the amended version that the committee unanimously supported, it would cost the state $3,341,394 over three years —  $254,860 in FY2024-25, $1,533,828 in FY2025-26 and $1,552,706 in FY2026-27.
“We have an actual crisis on our hands. And this is a very important piece of legislation that plugs a lot of those holes, maybe not perfectly …but we’ll address a very important situation,” said Rep. Rachel Henderson (R- Rumford).
“This is not something that’s possible without true bipartisan efforts and support.”
The number of adult criminal defendants waiting for state-appointed counsel exceeded 1,000 last December. According to the public defense commission, it fell 487 as of April 2 due to a combination of public defender offices and private attorneys taking cases off the list.
The state’s plan 
In response to the court’s requirements, the commission is proposing a strategy to reduce the number of unrepresented defendants and improve access to indigent legal services statewide. Some short-term solutions the state proposed includes direct outreach to recruit more qualified private attorneys, expanding law student internships and externships within public defenders’ offices, and developing a real-time shared system with court clerks to streamline and coordinate case assignments. 
To encourage attorneys to return to court rosters, the commission is proposing a five-case daily cap “since many attorneys state as a reason for not going on rosters for the fear that they will be assigned 20, 30 or more cases in a few days,” according to the document. The commission is also proposing reinstating geographic limits to prevent attorneys from taking on cases in multiple counties and having to travel. 
On March 25, Jim Billings, executive director of the commission, sent a letter to all district attorneys’ offices as well as the Maine Attorney General, urging them to reexamine charging decisions for lower-level offenses — such as drug possession, driving offenses, and violations of conditions of release. 
The letter asked prosecutors to evaluate each of their cases to ensure they can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and in cases where there are challenges with proof, missing witnesses, or other issues, to consider dismissing those.
The letter noted that nearly 90 defendants remain jailed without legal representation. 
“I do not make the suggestions in this letter lightly. No one wants us to be in this situation,” Billings wrote. “This is a constitutional crisis, but if we work together where possible to prioritize resources and make tough decisions, we can improve the way the criminal justice system is currently functioning in Maine.”
Another proposal being considered by the Legislature this session, LD 179, would help address the issue by removing from the bail code a charge if someone violates their condition of release. Maine is one of only six states that charges people with a separate crime for violating their conditions of release. In 2024 alone, there were over 5,400 such charges filed in Maine courts, according to Frayla Tarpinian, a former prosecutor who oversees Maine’s first brick-and-mortar public defender office. To compare, the second most common type of charge was 662 cases of drug possession, she said.
Maine’s current law is an example of excessive punishment, according to Abbe Smith, a Georgetown University law professor and director of the Criminal Defense and Prisoner Advocacy Clinic.
The ACLU did not comment on the commission’s plan, but will respond during a Monday hearing.

Keishan Scott, a councilman since first winning elected office in 2023, won by just 11 votes over Carl Whetsel, a retired chiropractor and former the Bishopville city councilman, according to Friday’s recount.
In the unofficial vote count for Tuesday’s primary, Scott finished with a 10-vote advantage. An automatic recount was required under state law since the winning margin was less than 1%.
Scott gained one vote via a provisional ballot when counties certified their tallies Thursday. Then on Friday, the state’s recount affirmed that Scott finished with 1,436 ballots, compared to Whetsel’s 1,425, said John Catalano, spokesman for the South Carolina Election Commission.
“It is the greatest joy of my life. I am elated,” Scott told the SC Daily Gazette Friday.

Whetsel said “it was a close race,” and he hopes the rural Pee Dee district will “have the best representation it can.”
The special election is needed to fill the seat vacated by Rep. Will Wheeler, a Bishopville Democrat who announced his resignation just three days into the 2025 session.
The district covers all of Lee County and parts of Kershaw and Sumter counties.
Lee County had issues with counting votes in November and the recount for a state Senate race that ousted Hartsville Democrat Gerald Malloy, who ultimately conceded ahead of his scheduled challenge.
Looking to avoid a repeat, the state Election Commission sent staff to Lee County to help out Tuesday, Catalano said.
Wheeler’s resignation left the rural district without a representative for this year’s entire regular session, which ends in May.
Scott will face Republican William Oden, chairman of the Sumter County GOP, on June 3. No other Republican filed for the seat that has been traditionally held by a Democrat.
There are currently 35 Democrats in the House. Republicans hold a supermajority with 88 seats.
Scott is optimistic he’ll bring that number to 36 for next year’s legislative session.

Four county sheriffs in Wisconsin have signed agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in recent months stating they’ll cooperate with the federal agency on immigration enforcement actions. 
Since March, Washington, Waupaca, Winnebago and Wood counties have signed onto ICE’s Warrant Service Officer program, which authorizes sheriff’s deputies to serve immigration warrants against undocumented immigrants in the county jail, according to an updated ICE list of participating agencies across the country. 
These four counties have joined eight others that already had existing agreements with the agency prior to the inauguration of President Donald Trump. 
In January, Tim Muth, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Wisconsin, told the Wisconsin Examiner these agreements were a method the Trump administration would use to find allies in its effort to deport millions of undocumented people. 
“What they do indicate is which are the counties who have already raised their hands and said, ‘we are happy to assist with deporting people from the state,’ and I anticipate that the Trump administration is going to start with that list and say ‘we know who our allies are in this in the state of Wisconsin,’” Muth said. “Let’s see if one: We can get more allies signing these agreements, and, two: For the ones who already have, let’s see what we can do to get them more active in this area.”
Immigrant rights advocates say the pre-existing agreements with ICE were hardly used under President Joe Biden, but under Trump they can be used to deport any undocumented person in the jail, even if they’re there for a low-level offense or before they can defend themselves in court against the charges they’re accused of. 
Republicans in the Wisconsin Legislature have been pushing for more county sheriffs to participate in these types of programs, authoring a bill that would require counties to verify the citizenship status of people in custody for a felony offense and notify ICE if citizenship cannot be verified. It would also require sheriffs to comply with detainers and administrative warrants received from the federal Department of Homeland Security for people held in the county jail for a criminal offense.
Under the proposed legislation, counties that don’t comply would lose 15% of their shared revenue payments from the state in the next year.

In a Friday afternoon news briefing, Gov. Andy Beshear said the child’s death while walking to his school bus stop “sadly underscores just how dangerous the flood waters can be.” 
“My heart breaks for the family,” Beshear said while on a Zoom call with journalists Friday afternoon.
Frankfort officials said the boy was walking to the school bus stop when he was caught in the water around 6:35 a.m. in the Hickory Hills area. He was recovered around 8:45 a.m. 
More bad weather — flooding, tornadoes, wind and hail — are expected through Sunday across a wide sweep of the state.
“We need everyone to understand that all water poses risk right now,” Beshear said. “Take every precaution. That includes never driving through standing water, even if you think you know how deep it is.” 
Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has approved the state’s request for an emergency declaration. 
“This is going to give us access to crucial federal support we need to help our people, and I want to thank the president,” Beshear said. “He has been responsive in every request we’ve made in a natural disaster, and his people have been supportive, professional and we’re grateful for them.” 
By the numbers 
About 3,823 people are without power and 300 roads are closed, a number that Transportation Cabinet Secretary Jim Gray said will increase. 
About 300 Kentucky National Guard members are either on weather-releated missions or ready for missions, as needed. 
Four urban search and rescue teams are ready to search for people, though there are currently no reports of missing Kentuckians, according to Kentucky Emergency Management Director Eric Gibson. 
The state has a call center set up for Kentucky Emergency Management: 502-607-6665. 
“At best, we’re halfway through this,” Gray said Friday afternoon. “One thing I want to really punctuate is that there are some places and some roads that we are not accustomed to seeing flooding on. Be prepared: it might occur on those roads.” 
Recovery will take a long time, Gibson said. 
“There is a serious flooding event still to come,” he said. “It’s going to be a long-duration event that’s going to take several days to see this water recede.”

In Paducah 
The worst of the multi-day storm is headed for West and Western Kentucky. Paducah is under a flood warning until Sunday, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). 
The weather service said counties from Jefferson to Carlisle should brace for more rain, hail, high winds and flooding. 
“Severe thunderstorms with the potential for very large hail, strong long-track tornadoes and damaging winds are expected to develop over southeast Missouri early this evening and then spread through southern Illinois and west Kentucky through the remainder of the evening,” the NWS warned Friday. “The severe threat will diminish with time and eastward extent across the Quad State, especially after midnight.” 
In Louisville 
Louisville is under flood and flash flood warnings through Sunday and the Ohio River is expected to rise, peaking at 68 feet on Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service. For context, a week prior on April 1, the river was at 24 feet, according to the United States Geological Survey. 
In response, the city has five “floodwall-roadway closures” in place “to protect the city from the rising Ohio River,” according to Mayor Craig Greenberg’s office. 
“With more heavy rain expected for Saturday, the current forecast is for the Ohio River to rise above 30 feet by early next week, which will likely cause significant flooding in low lying areas near the river and other creeks and streams across Louisville,” Greenberg said in a statement. “The most important thing residents can do is avoid flood waters. Please sign up for emergency alerts, prepare an emergency plan for your family, and stay informed. Taking basic steps to be prepared can save your life.”
Safety tips

Find shelter during the storm. Have a plan to go somewhere safe if you need to.
Do not drive through standing water.
Never move a barricade meant to keep you out of standing water on the roadway. 
Keep a flashlight, shoes and cell phone near your bed while you sleep. Make sure your phone is charged and weather alerts are turned on.
During a tornado, get as low as possible — the lowest room in the home, under a table. Get under something heavy and sturdy to protect yourself from debris.
During a tornado, stay away from windows and doors.
Make sure weather alerts and other safety alerts are turned on so you get them on your cell phone.

House of Representatives (Photo: Christine Zhu/NC Newsline)The North Carolina House of Representatives passed a bill allowing for alleged squatters to be removed from private property without the opportunity to contest the claims against them Wednesday.
Notably, the proposal, known as House Bill 96, drew opposition from three Republican members, a rarity in a caucus that typically votes in unison on matters that reach the House floor. It was one of just two bills this week that received “no” votes from multiple Republicans, in this case Reps. Hugh Blackwell (R-Burke), Carson Smith (R-Onslow), and Sarah Stevens (R-Surry). The bill also divided House Democrats, with 21 in favor and 26 opposed.
While Blackwell and Smith did not elaborate on their opposition, Stevens said in a House Rules Committee meeting Tuesday that she feared a “tremendous amount of violation of due process” under the proposal, which allows property owners to call on law enforcement for the expedited removal of alleged squatters occupying a residence they own, so long as they swear the individual is not a tenant or co-owner and has made no prior rental agreement or payment under penalty of felony perjury.
Though the bill does not allow the property’s occupants to contest their removal during the action, it allows them to pursue civil action to reverse wrongful eviction and recover damages as well as creating steep penalties for landlords that swear false affidavits in the removal process.
Introducing the bill Wednesday, sponsor Rep. Steve Tyson (R-Craven) touted support from the North Carolina Realtors, the Home Builders Association, and other property and rental interest groups. He noted that the North Carolina Justice Center, which often defends the rights of tenants, did not oppose the bill, nor did the Conference of District Attorneys.
Tyson did not discuss the specifics of the bill on the floor, but at Tuesday’s committee meeting, he said it was unacceptable that such a dispute could be held up in court “practically forever.”
“Anybody can get a lease online now and print it out,” Tyson told the committee. “You can go somewhere online, find a copy of the deed to the property if you’re savvy and see how the owner of the property signs their name. And so, it puts law enforcement in a very precarious position.”
The only other lawmaker to comment on the bill Wednesday, Rep. Marcia Morey (D-Durham) criticized the proposal as “circumventing the courts” and creating greater risk that individuals are evicted from their homes with no recourse to prevent it. She called to give the individuals being removed notice and to allow them to state their case to reduce the risk of wrongful removal.
“It has someone going before a magistrate with an affidavit and they sign their name and they swear to it and they give it to them and within 24 hours, law enforcement is supposed to remove any person that’s inhabiting that structure,” Morey said. “The Chiefs of Police are opposed to it and they do think doing something this expedited based only on a person’s affidavit in signature could put people in harm.”
Morey said that House Bill 966, a bill with similar intent brought by Republicans in the previous session, was a much better alternative. It largely created the same expedited removal process but with the key exceptions that a removal hearing would be held within two days of notice, allowing the alleged squatter to state their case and contest the claims against them.
“I think this is totally ignoring due process, safety of officers, and I encourage us to revisit it with an expedited process that follows people’s rights, so I encourage you to vote no,” Morey said.

(USDA photo by Lance Cheung.)A bill to increase the business equipment exemption limit got out of the Senate — but with a much smaller increase than first proposed.
Senate Bill 322, a priority for Gov. Greg Gianforte, originally would have pushed the exemption for business equipment up to $3 million — a tripling from the current $1 million on top of the tripling last session.
“It’s an awful big jump going from $1 million to $3 million,” said Minority Leader Pat Flowers, D-Belgrade, in the Senate Finance and Claims Committee on Wednesday.
Flowers pitched bumping the increase down to $1.5 million instead, a change the committee approved.
Sen. Josh Kassmier, R-Fort Benton, the bill sponsor, said that isn’t where he wanted to be, but any increase would help small businesses.
On the Senate floor Thursday, Kassmier said the reduction was a compromise, and the bill passed its final vote Friday 40-9 with bipartisan support and opposition.
Some senators had wanted the tax to go the opposite direction.
In committee, Sen. Forrest Mandeville, R-Columbus, said getting rid of that tax altogether would be fine with him.
Kassmier, though, said total elimination would “get real expensive,” and the idea was to give a break to smaller businesses, not big corporations.
The farming and ranching community spoke in support of the bill given the high cost of agricultural equipment — and Gianforte described the business equipment tax as a “tool tax.”
Opponents of the bill pointed out that the business equipment class has received significant and repeated breaks over the years, but residential property taxpayers are shouldering a greater burden of all the property tax payments.
In committee, Sen. John Esp, R-Big Timber, asked Department of Revenue Director Brendan Beatty how to justify the shift from the business equipment class to other payers.
“Is that just a casualty of business as usual in Helena?” Esp said.
Beatty said in the property tax world, there’s always a shift, but he said one thing that’s forgotten in the debate is the way the economy in the state has changed in the last five decades.
Montana used to have 42 sawmills paying taxes, he said. “We have six now.” It used to have gold mines and oil fields and a big aluminum plant in Columbia Falls, he said.
In the meantime, residences have increased in value and increased in number, Beatty said.
“It is a shift no matter what. And the unfortunate part is we have a greater demand for services now and fewer underwriters,” Beatty said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Tractor-sweet-potatoes-Virginia-1024x664.jpg,,,2025-04-04 17:03:08.411647

The nonprofit, which provides civics, arts and cultural education, relies on funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities to cover core operational costs, Executive Director Brenna Gerhardt said.
She said Humanities North Dakota received a letter earlier this week from the National Endowment for the Humanities indicating that a $900,000 grant it received for the 2025 fiscal year was axed effective immediately. The nonprofit, which has four full-time and two part-time staff, had yet to spend about $600,000 of the grant, said Gerhardt.
“We’ll have to close our doors,” she said. 
The National Endowment for the Humanities, which provides funding to humanities organizations across the country, is “repurposing its funding allocations in a new direction in furtherance of the President’s agenda,” Acting Chairman Michael McDonald wrote in the letter.
The letter cites a Feb. 19 executive order by President Donald Trump which the White House says aims to downsize federal bureaucracy.
Other state humanities councils have received similar letters from the federal government revoking their grant money.
The Department of Government Efficiency has recommended that the National Endowment for the Humanities reduce its staff by a significant amount, NPR reported.

Gerhardt said Humanities North Dakota will review its finances to determine how long it will be able to stay open. A lot of programming will have to be cut, she said.
The nonprofit’s programs — which include online classes, book talks, lectures and more — reached an estimated 24,000 people last year, Gerhardt said. During the summer, it hosts a civics education program for high school and middle school social studies teachers. Gerhardt said this program will continue.
“This is what makes it affordable for a lot of people, not just the elite who can afford to go to a program,” said Dina Butcher, who sits on the nonprofit’s board, said of the federal funding. “This puts it in the grasp of just ordinary citizens for these wonderful programs that are offered at a really low cost.”
Congress created the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1965 and appropriates funding for the grants.
Humanities North Dakota sent out emails this week asking its supporters to urge the state’s congressional delegation to restore the funding.
“My sense is that since Congress was the one that allocated the funds that go out to the states, that they should be the ones that claw this whole thing back again,” Butcher said.
Gerhardt said the nonprofit has been in touch with the offices of Sen. John Hoeven and Rep. Julie Fedorchak.
In a letter addressed to Hoeven, Gerhardt said Humanities North Dakota has an important role to play in helping to educate North Dakotans about civic life. For example, it’s planning special events to help the state celebrate the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 2026.
“Our upcoming commemorative programming — including living history performances, public readings of the Declaration of Independence, and civics education initiatives — is designed to deepen public understanding of our founding principles and engage people of all ages in the
democratic process,” Gerhardt wrote in the letter. “Without continued federal support, much of this programming is in jeopardy.”
A spokesperson for Fedorchak said in an email her staff are looking into the matter.
“We have reached out to the NEH to seek more clarification on this decision, how other states are being impacted, and their approach to state grant funding longer term,” the email said, using an acronym for the National Endowment for the Humanities.

Kennedy Jr. and NIH Director Jayanta Bhattacharya as defendants, the attorneys general said since President Donald Trump retook office, NIH has delayed the review approvable process for grants that should have been awarded.The agency has refused to pay for multi-year grants that were approved under previous administrations, citing disagreements over race and gender issues, the suit filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts says.Massachusetts, California, Maryland, Washington, Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Wisconsin filed the suit.NIH work ‘in jeopardy’The attorneys general in those states praised the NIH as “the crown jewel” of health research that has fueled medical breakthroughs and spurred economic growth across the country.“That critical work is now in jeopardy,” they wrote. “By law, NIH provides much of its support for scientific research and training in the form of grants to outside institutions. Since January, however, the current Administration has engaged in a concerted, and multi-pronged effort to disrupt NIH’s grants.”Starting last month, NIH sent “hundreds of letters” to research institutions in the states canceling grants that had already been issued. The institutions were told the grants “no longer effectuate… agency priorities,” according to the complaint.Those cancellations stem from three executive orders Trump signed on his first day back in office targeting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and recognition of transgender people. Agency leaders followed up with directives to pause related grants.The letters to research institutions declare “the grant in question has been terminated because of some connection to ‘DEI,’ ‘transgender issues,’ “vaccine hesitancy,” or another topic disfavored by the current Administration,” the attorneys general wrote.HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.Yet another legal battleThe department is also facing a suit from a wider group of Democratic states over the cancellation of other grants that were initially issued during the COVID-19 pandemic. Those states say the department overrode extensions of the grants and rescinded $11 billion in funding that has led to layoffs and work stoppages.A federal judge on Thursday ordered those grants to be temporarily restored as the case unfolds.",,,,2025-04-04 17:03:08.411647

(Courtesy Montana DOT)Every year, more than 3,200 Montana drivers are involved in accidents with wildlife, according to the state Department of Transportation. And every year, department maintenance crews and tribal officers collect more than 6,000 wildlife animal carcasses, primarily large mammals, from the state’s roadways. 
Data analyzed by State Farm Insurance shows collisions with wildlife contribute to more than 10% of all car accidents in Montana, making Big Sky Country the second-highest risk state. 
Speaker Pro Tempore Katie Zolnikov, speaking to the House Transportation Committee, said a recent survey showed that 70% of Montana drivers have been involved in a collision with wildlife. 
“That’s the problem that we’re aiming to fix with this, because there are many Montanans that are impacted by these wildlife vehicle collisions,” said Zolnikov, R-Billings.
Zolnikov introduced House Bill 855, to create a new specialty license plate for Montana drivers. The funds would be allocated to a new Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks account that can be used in consultation with DOT to research, design, build and maintain wildlife crossing structures, which can include overpasses, underpasses, culverts and fencing. 
The Montana House of Representatives passed the bill this week with just six votes in opposition. 
The big game and wildlife highway crossings and accommodations account will be funded through a $20 fee collected from drivers who select the specialty license plate, which will be designed by FWP. The bill’s fiscal note estimates that the plate could generate roughly $160,000 annually, based on existing donations associated with the state’s 203 other specialty plates. 
By establishing the special revenue account, which could also accept gifts and donations, FWP and DOT would be able to provide matching funds for grants that fund wildlife crossing projects. 
Chris Dorrington, DOT director, testified in support of the bill during the committee hearing and said it was the result of extensive coordination. 
“Wildlife, accommodations and associated fencing are very expensive,” Dorrington said. “Average simple underpasses are between $500,000 and $2 million, simple overpasses are between $3 and $10 million. The costs increase dramatically if you’re on multi-lane facilities such as interstates. MDT cannot meet future accommodation needs just with the current funding in place.”
“This bill is a positive way for the public to engage and show support for wildlife accommodations,” he said. 
Dorrington cited studies that show wildlife fencing, crossings, and associated structures greatly reduce wildlife collisions, including up to 80% for large wildlife overpasses.

Nearly a dozen groups testified in favor of the legislation, including wildlife and conservation groups, insurance companies, the Association of Montana Troopers and Enterprise Rent-a-Car. 
The bill drew no opponents.
Montana has more than 125 wildlife crossing structures in place along its highways, according to the MDT. That includes 41 structures along U.S. Highway 93 between Evaro and Polson, installed from 2009 to 2010 through a cooperative effort between MDT, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes and the Federal Highway Administration. 
The most obvious structure to passing motorists is the “Animals’ Trail,” a 197-foot-wide vegetated bridge that spans the busy highway near Gray Wolf Peak Casino at the southern end of the Flathead Indian Reservation.
In 2023, the CSKT received an $8.6 million grant through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act to construct a wildlife overpass spanning U.S. 93, within the Ninepipe National Wildlife Management Area.

Notably for [&#8230;]","Ballot envelopes sit in the Thurston County elections center. (Laurel Demkovich/Washington State Standard)The Washington and Oregon attorneys general sued the Trump administration Friday over its executive order on elections that seeks to withhold funding unless states comply with dramatic rule changes.
President Donald Trump’s sweeping order, signed March 25, looks to uproot voter registration and mail-in voting rules under the auspices of eradicating election fraud. Notably for Washington and Oregon, the order seeks to prevent states from counting ballots received after Election Day. 
“The order makes it harder to vote, erodes public confidence in our elections and makes it more expensive for states to administer our systems,” Washington Attorney General Nick Brown said, “and most alarming, it would disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of Washington residents.”
The order tells the bipartisan and independent Election Assistance Commission to require documentation of U.S. citizenship, like a passport or enhanced driver’s license, as a prerequisite to registering to vote in federal elections. 
Over 9% of American citizens of voting age don’t have proof of citizenship readily available, according to a report from the Brennan Center for Justice. Americans of color are more likely than white citizens to lack on-hand citizenship documents.
Washington state law mandates that people attest to their citizenship to register to vote. Statute also requires state and local election officials to regularly review voter rolls to identify people not eligible to vote.
Washington is one of 18 states to count mail ballots as long as they are postmarked by Election Day. In the 2024 general election, for example, election officials received nearly 120,000 valid ballots after Election Day that were postmarked on time. In the primary last year, officials accepted 151,000.
“This is like allowing persons who arrive 3 days after Election Day, perhaps after a winner has been declared, to vote in person at a former voting precinct, which would be absurd,” Trump’s order contends. 
This could also impact ballots returned to drop boxes on time, but not immediately retrieved. Other states only accept votes they receive by Election Day.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Department of Government Efficiency would review state voter rolls to ensure they’re consistent with the new federal requirements. 
In a press conference, Washington Secretary of State Steve Hobbs called the idea for the review “foolhardy and ridiculous.”
The order directs the Election Assistance Commission to condition federal funding on states complying with these new demands. States that don’t comply could also face action from the U.S. attorney general.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle, argues Trump’s order violates the U.S. Constitution, which says states will decide election mechanics, and unconstitutionally infringes on the right to vote.
“The president has no authority to set rules for how states conduct their elections,” said Brown. “Democrats and Republicans in our state have worked together to protect and expand participation in our democracy, and Washington has a robust, safe and secure, voting system.”
The amount of money the state receives from the commission has varied widely year-to-year. Last year, Washington got $1 million, the lowest in six years, according to the secretary of state’s office. The order isn’t clear on whether the administration could also withhold other funding.
Washington’s lawsuit is one of several to challenge the president’s order. 
On Monday, top Democratic organizations and leaders, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, filed suit. 
And on Thursday, 19 other Democratic-led states brought a separate lawsuit over the order in federal court in Massachusetts. 
Unlike other cases Washington has brought, the attorney general is not asking for a judge to temporarily block Trump’s election order.
“Temporary restraining orders need to be brought where there’s an emergency impact,” Brown said. “Because we don’t have an election pending in the short term, we did not feel like a TRO was necessary.”
Nos. 9,10 and 11
Friday’s lawsuit sets the stage for yet another showdown between Washington and the president.
Brown has now filed 11 lawsuits against the Trump administration since the president’s second term began in January. It is also the fourth this week, including a lawsuit filed Tuesday against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over billions in canceled federal health funding. 
A judge on Thursday agreed to temporarily block the administration from terminating the grant funding.
On Friday, Brown also was one of the leaders of a new 16-state lawsuit against the Trump administration over disruptions to grant funding from the National Institutes of Health.
And Brown said the state was joining yet another case with 20 other states to protect small federal agencies focused on museums, libraries, minority-owned businesses and more. Trump has proposed dismantling them.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — For every hour Lisa Lee works caring for people in their homes, her employer receives $25 per hour. In 10 years of work, she has never gotten more than $15 per hour.
Lee’s employer, like all home health providers in the state, gets funding through Medicaid reimbursements for home care waivers. Under state law, providers have no requirement to pay care workers more than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour.
The portion of the reimbursement that doesn’t go to workers is set aside for administrative costs. That often means roughly half of what taxpayers provide for services goes toward bureaucracy instead of the caregiver, and that’s not right, said Maria Reyes, South Carolina’s organizing director for the National Domestic Workers Alliance.
The low wages are causing health care workers to flee the field for higher-paying jobs, at a time when South Carolina’s aging population needs more caregivers, not less. To stem the exodus, the state should limit how much providers can take from the workers doing the job, she said.

  Sen. Darrell Jackson, D-Columbia, talks about a bill Tuesday, April 1, 2025, at the Statehouse about a bill he proposed that would raise pay for home health care workers. (Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)

A bill introduced in the Statehouse last week would require providers to pass on at least 70% of their reimbursement rate to care workers. That’s $17.50 per hour at the current rate of $25 per hour.
Home health workers are tasked with doing whatever a person needs on a daily basis, such as bathing them, giving them medication or helping them move around the house.
Beyond that, health workers are often a friend and source of comfort for their clients, Reyes said.
“You’re not just washing someone. You’re not just feeding someone. You’re not just giving meds,” she said. “You’re that person’s person while you’re there.”
In 2023, the median wage for home health care workers in the state was $13.62 per hour, according to PHI, a national nonprofit that promotes care for the elderly and people with disabilities. For a person working 40 hours a week, that would equate to a yearly salary of about $28,300 per year.
There have been times when Lee, who lives and works in Camden, has had to choose between asking her boss for an advance to pay for gas or walking to her clients’ houses because she couldn’t afford to fill up her car’s tank, she said.
“I shouldn’t have to ask my boss for help,” Lee said, adding she should be able to pay for it herself.
Trying to make some more money, she took on more clients. But the more people she cared for, the less time she had to spend with each of them. She can’t afford to take sick days or vacation, since her job offered no paid time off, she said.
“These are the sacrifices I make because I love what I do,” said Lee, who declined to name her employer. “But home health care workers are neglecting their own needs.”
Sen. Darrell Jackson, the bill’s sponsor, credits a home health care worker with keeping his father alive for an extra several years two decades ago while he was in hospice at home. Knowing his father was getting the care he needed took some stress off Jackson and his family, he said.
But with low pay driving people out of the profession and into other work, not everyone gets that chance, said the Hopkins Democrat. That was why he sponsored the bill, which has yet to receive a committee hearing. He’s also pushing for a clause in the state budget that has the same effect.
“When you look at their average pay, it is pretty ridiculous,” Jackson said.
Families who can’t find a home health care worker often have to take on the responsibilities of round-the-clock care themselves, sometimes at great personal sacrifice, said Reyes, who lives in Columbia.
Her father qualified for a home health worker under Medicaid in 2022 as his health declined from congestive heart failure, but no local agencies had enough workers to help him, she said. Instead, her niece quit her job and moved from North Carolina, and her brother retired early to take care of him, Reyes said.
“The whole point of us applying for the waiver was for us to get a break, for us to have someone directly for my dad,” Reyes said. “Unfortunately, we never got the chance.”
Her father died while still on a waiting list for a worker. As of last July, nearly 20,000 people were on a waiting list to receive a waiver, according to the state’s Medicaid agency.
As the state’s population ages, the number of people looking for at-home care is expected to grow. In the next decade, the state is projected to need nearly 11,000 more home health care workers than it already has, which is more than any other health care job, according to the state Department of Employment and Workforce.
How many people can get services depends on whether the state has the money to reimburse providers for their care. The House’s initial spending plan includes $5 million to increase the number of slots available for Home and Community-Based Services waivers, which pay for home health care workers to take care of people.
Getting more people the help they need is great, Reyes said. But increasing the number of people eligible for a home health care worker without taking steps to improve pay and conditions for the workers will likely only make the problem worse, she said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3741-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-04 17:03:08.411647

This partnership will allow officers of the Wells Police Department in York County to arrest people on immigration violations in the course of routine work, an authority previously reserved for federal agents.   U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement [&#8230;]","Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrest a fugitive in 2020. (Photo via U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)A federal immigration enforcement agency signed its first contract with a local police department in Maine this week.
This partnership will allow officers of the Wells Police Department in York County to arrest people on immigration violations in the course of routine work, an authority previously reserved for federal agents.  
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement signed this agreement — known as the 287(g) program — with the department on Wednesday, April 2, according to data ICE released Friday morning. Police Chief Jo-Ann Putnam submitted the application last week and told Maine Morning Star her department received an email Friday afternoon from Enforcement and Removal Operations informing them it had been accepted. 
The data also shows a pending application from Monmouth Winthrop Police Department, a combination of departments that serve central Maine communities. Police chiefs in both counties did not respond to requests for comment by the time of publication. Some sheriffs in other counties told Maine Morning Star they are also considering signing up. 
This official agreement marks a shift in how local law enforcement in Maine is cooperating with President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement. 
Local enforcement so far has been disjointed. In the absence of such agreements, police have alerted federal agencies when questions of immigration status arise and it’s unclear if there are specific guidelines or protocol for when to do so. 
The agreement in Wells and pending application for central Maine are both for the program’s “task force model,” which is described as a “force multiplier.” According to ICE, the federal agency will train and supervise local officers so they can arrest people for immigration violations during their day-to-day duties.
The email to the Wells Police Department confirming its agreement stated that all participating officers must have at least two years of law enforcement experience and be U.S. citizens, and that the agency would contact the department to schedule training at a later date, Putnam said.
Putnam said she views the program as a chance for more training and a way to eliminate what she views as redundancy.
“We’re looking at it as a tool for us and for the officers on the road to help them do their job better,” Putnam said, “and be able to make arrests at two o’clock in the morning and be able to deal with it and not have to wait for what possibly could be several hours for an ICE agent to get here, because what that does is that takes time away from them doing their regular duties of patrolling the town of Wells.”
Conversely, Sue Roche, executive director at the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, believes such agreements hurt the rights and public safety of all residents by deterring communication with police.
Before Trump reinstated the 287(g) program, it was discontinued in 2012 after the discovery of abuses, including racial profiling, which Roche noted impacts people who aren’t immigrants, too. 
Roche said she has already seen immigrants — those with and without legal status — now afraid to share public safety information with law enforcement and argues that would worsen, to the detriment of all, if local law enforcement is working on behalf of federal immigration authorities. Fears of reaching out to local police can also give abusers more power to threaten victims who do not have legal status, Roche added.
While immigration is a federal matter by law, work on the local level is key. An estimated 70% of ICE arrests nationwide over the past decade have been handoffs from state or local authorities, and Trump’s former acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the president’s “mass deportation” plan won’t work without state assistance.
While 287(g) agreements expand across the country, Democratic legislators in Maine have proposed legislation to prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies or officers from entering into such contracts. The bill has yet to have a public hearing. 
According to the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, only Oregon and Illinois have comprehensive state laws restricting transfers of people to ICE, while some place limits on cooperation. 
Putnam said she hadn’t been aware of the bill before submitting the 287(g) application but hopes Mainers have confidence in their local and state law enforcement officers. 
“These will be low frequency events but it enables us to act,” Putnam said of the agreement. “If us having this training prevents a dangerous person from being on the streets in the town of Wells in the state of Maine, then I think it’s only helpful that we have this training.”
Roche sees the Trump administration’s tactics as “broadly targeting all immigrant communities by pushing a false narrative that there is a link between being an immigrant and criminality.”
No such link exists, an assertion backed up by research, some of which has found the opposite, that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than U.S.-born citizens. 
“Local law enforcement handing over public safety resources to target our community members who simply want to live peacefully, work, and contribute to Maine will harm all of us now and for future generations to come,” Roche said.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)  As the Iowa Legislature advanced past the second major deadline of the 2025 session, conversations on pipelines, Medicaid work requirements and new higher education requirements are continuing through surviving bills — though agreements have not necessarily been reached between the two Republican-controlled chambers.
The session’s second “funnel” deadline is another checkpoint for lawmakers during the legislative session, culling the bills that remain eligible for consideration as the Legislature nears the end of session. During the first funnel, bills were required to gain approval by a committee in one chamber to survive. In the second funnel, bills must have passed in floor debate in one chamber and gained committee approval in the other chamber to remain eligible.
There are several exceptions to this deadline, such as bills involving taxes, spending and government oversight components, and they include the property tax legislation proposed by Iowa lawmakers. Legislative leaders can also sponsor a bill and bring it forward without abiding by the deadline.
 In addition, the language of a bills considered “dead” because of the funnel can still be added, at any point, as an amendment to a surviving bill.
There are also several bills that remain eligible for consideration by being placed on the “unfinished business” calendar, allowing them to remain up for consideration during the remainder of the session.
As numerous high-profile bills were placed on the “unfinished business” calendar this year, House Speaker Pat Grassley said many of the bills were ones that “may be part of a priority, but we’re maybe not ready to work on.”
“I think our philosophy would be more, overall, if there’s bills that need more work, we can have that opportunity to do,” Grassley said. “That doesn’t mean that all of them will happen, but to just let some priorities just die because of the funnel process.”
Grassley said that he believes there are “still a lot of priorities that are lying out there that need more work” before lawmakers end session, but that he did not see the legislature as operating differently in 2025 compared to previous sessions.
Though the House introduced and passed more bills than the Iowa Senate, Senate President Amy Sinclair said the chamber was focused on ensuring bills that lower costs for Iowans and businesses and “make Iowa the best place to live, work and raise your family” are passed this session.
“Moving forward, those priorities that the Senate had at the beginning of session — property tax policy, working on health care availability — all of those priorities we had to begin in session will still be our priorities,” Sinclair said. “And we have bills that are live to make that happen.”
But House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst said that GOP lawmakers have not been passing bills that improve Iowans’ lives or lower costs.
“Between the chaos in Washington, the chaos in the global economy and some worries about Iowa’s economy, Iowans are concerned,” Konfrst said. “They want to know what will happen to their pocketbooks. … Republicans have done nothing to help Iowa’s economy this session. So far, they have done nothing to help Iowans when it comes to their budgets and their pocketbooks.”
Some bills have already made it through both chambers to Gov. Kim Reynolds’ desk. The governor signed into law the bill removing gender identity from the Iowa Civil Rights Act in February, and this week signed into law legislation banning the handheld use of cellphones while driving.
 School funding remains stalled

One of the major bills that has not gone to the governor yet this session is school funding. The legislature failed to meet a self-imposed deadline of passing the State Supplemental Aid (SSA) rate, providing per-pupil funding for Iowa public K-12 schools, within 30 days of the governor’s budget being released. Failing to meet this deadline has caused problems for schools in previous sessions, as school districts are required to publish their budgets in early March — deadlines which have already passed.
The holdup comes from differing SSA proposals from House and Senate Republicans. Reynolds and the Senate Republicans have supported a 2% SSA rate, but House Republicans have countered with a 2.25% funding increase alongside other spending components including a one-time boost of $22.6 million for per-pupil costs. The House amended Senate File 167 and sent it back to the Senate in February with its higher funding goals in February, but the bill has not seen action since.
Sinclair said that she believed that an agreement would be reached soon on school funding. She also added that one of the reasons for the delay was uncertainty about the state’s budget estimates for the upcoming fiscal year.
“We’ll get something passed out this coming week,” Sinclair said. “It’s important that we waited for the revenue estimating conference for March. We know that the commodity prices are down, and it impacts our overall revenues for the state – so we needed to see where that was, to see the number that’s going out for school funding.”
The Revenue Estimating Conference estimated Iowa’s revenue will be at $8.5 billion in fiscal year 2026, lower than the governor’s $9.4 billion budget proposal for the upcoming year. GOP leaders said they expected to see a drop in revenue due to the income tax cut that took effect in January and planned to make up for shortfalls using the Taxpayer Relief Fund.
 As budget discussions begin, impact of tariffs, federal actions remain unclear

School funding is the largest component of Iowa’s state budget, but lawmakers will begin discussing other appropriations bills on other state spending obligations in the coming weeks. 
As President Donald Trump’s announcement this week of sweeping tariffs caused major plummets in the U.S. stock market, Konfrst said that Republicans need to be “realistic” about the impact of Trump’s policies on Iowa’s economy and the state budget.
“We can’t play politics with Iowa’s economic outlook,” Konfrst said. “We have to be realistic about the impact of the chaotic tariff policy that’s happening, and we have to look at what that’s going to do to Iowans.”
Konfrst said Republicans should consider areas where costs can be saved in Iowa’s existing budget that are currently being drawn from GOP-supported policies like the Education Savings Account program, which will begin providing public funds for private school tuition and associated costs with no family income cap in the 2025-2026 school year.
“When Republicans are drafting their budget, they have to be able to understand that next year doesn’t look like it’s going to be much better, or, if anything, it’ll be worse … than this year,” Konfrst said. The Democratic leader called GOP lawmakers to consider, “What can we do to prepare for an economy that isn’t doing very well right now? Instead of just saying yes, this is all great, let’s cut more taxes to corporations, which is what Republicans seem focused on doing.
Grassley said that Republicans are drafting their budget using REC estimates, but said that he believed the state is in a sound economic position to weather economic hardships because of GOP leadership’s practices that left the state with a $2 billion budget surplus in 2024 alongside other reserve funds.
“I think that as a state, we’ve done a good job of making sure that we leave ourselves a cushion, you know, with an ending balance, with the Taxpayer Relief Fund, having the rainy day and a surplus full,” Grassley said. “… We’ve always talked about (having funds) for unforeseen things like, potentially, what the short-term impacts on this may be. That’s why we’ve budgeted the way we’ve had the last seven years.”
Before lawmakers move fully into the budgeting process, there are still many policy proposals left to be debated. Here is a rundown on the bills that remain on the table following the second funnel deadline – and which bills did not make the cut.
 
 Bills that survived

 
 Agriculture

Grain indemnity: House File 508, would increase the grain indemnity fund maximum to $16 million to cover farmers’ losses when their buyers go broke and would allow farmers with credit-sale contracts to partake in the fund’s protections. HF 508 advanced through the second funnel as a committee bill from the House Ways and Means Committee. 
A grain indemnity bill in the Senate, would only increase the fund to a $12 million maximum and would also include credit-sale contracts. Senate File 608 was placed on the calendar under unfinished business.
Reducing nitrogen fertilizer: House File 942, aims to reduce the statewide average use of commercial nitrogen fertilizers by 15% with the creation of a pilot program in the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship. The bill, formerly House Study Bill 165, advanced to the House Appropriations Committee which is excluded from funnel deadlines.
Drones: Senate File 491 would prohibit remote-piloted aircraft from flying over a “farmstead” or within 400 feet of farm animals, farm equipment or structures. Senators advanced the bill to the House where it is now eligible for floor debate. 
 Education

Absence exception for religious instruction: House File 870, passed unanimously out of the Iowa Senate Education Committee in late March, would alter state attendance laws to exempt students attending religious instruction. 
Bullying definition: Current Iowa Code defines bullying and harassment as actions or conduct toward a student that target them based on real or perceived traits, listing characteristics like race, religion, sexual orientation, and familial status as potential traits that a student could be bullied over. House File 865 would change the definition of bullying to remove language that bullying is based on “any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of the student.”
Career education: House File 316 would require career planning curriculum be taught in fifth and sixth grades and expand criteria for career education in seventh and eighth grades, as well as have the Iowa Department of Education develop a list of industry recognized credentials, create a seal and provide it to schools to add onto student transcripts and other documents if they have earned a credential before graduating.
Cellphones in school: Gov. Kim Reynolds’ bill to set a statewide minimum policy banning the use of cellphones in K-12 school classrooms, House File 782, has gained approval in both chambers, but the Iowa House still must approve an amendment from the Senate before the measure can head to the governor’s desk. The Senate proposed changes requiring the Iowa Department of Education director to share a model policy on banning the use of personal electronic devices during instructional time by May 1, before districts’ deadline to adopt their own policy by July 1 ahead of the 2025-2026 school year. This version of the bill also removed an earlier requirement for students in grades 6 through 8 to take training on the “effects of social media.”
Charter school boards: House File 785 would change requirements for charter-school boards so that no more than one member can live outside of Iowa, and all members must be U.S. residents. The legislation made it through the second funnel after being passed by the Iowa Senate Education Committee April 3. 
Child abuse investigations: House File 389, passed by the Iowa House and attached to a companion Senate bill placed on unfinished business, would give the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services the authority to investigate alleged child abuse cases at schools and work with the state Board of Educational Examiners if these instances involve school employees.
Concussion diagnoses: House File 471 would expand the list of professionals who can direct a student to be removed from extracurricular activities based on them showing signs of brain damage or concussion to include those with a doctorate in psychology and specialized training in concussion management or neuropsychology. 
Dropout prevention funding: House File 579 would increase the limit modified supplemental amount ratio school districts can levy for dropout prevention programs to 5% if decided upon at an election, with the amount not allowed to increase more than .5% every fiscal year. 
Fetal development instruction: In February the Iowa Senate passed Senate File 175 in a 31-13 vote, a bill that would require fetal development videos and graphics depicting “the humanity of the unborn child by showing prenatal human development, starting at fertilization” to be shown in human growth and development and health classes for grades 1 through 12. The measure has been linked by opponents to the “Meet Baby Olivia” video produced by an anti-abortion organization, and said that the legislation could allow non-scientifically accurate information to be shown in public school courses. The Senate bill’s companion, House File 391, was moved to unfinished business for further consideration.
Grooming behavior: Senate File 273, passed by the Iowa Senate and surviving as “unfinished business” in the House, would require mandatory reporting of licensed school employees to the Board of Educational Examiners if they engage in “grooming behavior” toward students, defined as the process of “ building trust or emotional connections with a student with the intent to exploit such student.” 
Math, civics education: The House passed the governor’s proposal on math education in March. House File 784 would implement  early screening and targeted intervention strategies for students struggling with math in Iowa’s K-12 schools, with the state Department of Education providing schools and districts support with constructing personalized mathematics instruction plans. The companion to the bill, Senate File 450, includes a component requiring Iowa students pass the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ Naturalization Test with 60% or higher to graduating high school which is not present in the House legislation.
Schools and natural disasters: House File 315, passed unanimously by the Senate Education Committee, would allow school districts impacted by a natural disaster to have an additional year of budget adjustments. 
Nonpublic school athletics: House File 189, which the Senate Education Committee passed to the floor this week, would direct school districts to allow students living in the district but attending a nonpublic school to participate in athletics the district offers but the nonpublic school hasn’t for the past two years.
School chaplains: The Senate Education Committee approved House File 884, which allows public school districts, charter schools and innovation school zones to hire or allow religious chaplains to volunteer providing “services” for students. Democrats have criticized the measure as a breach of the separation of church and state.
School performance profiles: House file 393 would change how school performance grades for school districts are calculated by no longer requiring each time a student drops out of school after the first time be counted against the school. 
Tampons, pads in school bathrooms: House File 883 proposes providing free feminine hygiene products in women’s restrooms at Iowa schools for 6th through 12th grade students, with state funding available from the summer of 2025 through June 2028. The bill, referred to the House Appropriations Committee, is not subject to the funnel deadline.
Threat assessment teams: The Iowa Senate passed Senate File 583 unanimously in March, a bill that authorize K-12 school districts, private schools and charter schools to create threat assessment teams to coordinate resources and interventions for preventing school shootings. The teams would consist of school officials, law enforcement officers as well as mental health and social services workers, who would be allowed to share “reasonably necessary” information on students when a student exhibits behavior that could pose a safety risk to other students or school staff.
Year-round academic calendar: Passed unanimously by the Iowa Senate Education Committee at the end of March, House File 392 would allow school districts to apply to implement year-round school calendars for ninth through 12th grade. 
 Higher education

DEI in state entities: House File 856 would bar state entities, including community colleges, from spending private or public dollars on opening or maintaining diversity, equity and inclusion offices or officers. The Iowa Senate Education Committee approved an amendment to remove private universities from the legislation before passing the bill to the Senate floor April 3. 
Accreditation retaliation: House File 295 was one of several bills passed out of the Iowa Senate Education Committee just before the funnel deadline. It would bar national accrediting agencies from taking negative actions against state universities for complying with, or refusing to disobey, state law. If authorized by the attorney general, universities with cause would have the option to file a civil suit against the accreditor. 
College reporting requirements: Senate File 520 would change where community colleges report program-level data to from the state community colleges bureau to the Iowa Department of Education. The Iowa Department of Administrative Services and Department of Education must also develop an annual compensation schedule and set employee benefits for all employees of the Iowa Educational Services for the Blind and Visually Impaired and Iowa School for the Deaf. It has been attached to House File 890 and placed on the calendar as unfinished business. 
General education requirements: House File 401 would, as amended by the Iowa House, establish general education requirements for Iowa’s public higher education system, codifying requirements to take courses in social studies, math and statistics, natural and social sciences, a world language, the humanities, Western heritage and American heritage. According to the bill, these classes cannot “distort significant historical events or include any curriculum or other material that teaches identity politics or is based on theories that systemic racism, sexism, oppression, or privilege are inherent in the institutions of the United States of America or the state of Iowa.” It passed out of the Iowa Senate Education Committee on April 3.
National Guard financial aid: House Files 117 and 118, both passed out of the House and received approval from the Iowa Senate Education Committee, expand scholarship offerings for members of the Iowa National Guard and their families. HF 117 would establish a new scholarship program for National Guard members pursuing certifications rather than traditional degrees. HF 118 would change monetary limits on the existing National Guard Service Scholarship program to “the difference between the tuition rate at the institution attended by the national guard member less any financial aid the national guard member receives under certain specified federal programs,” according to the legislation. The bill removes language that bars recipients’ drill location, unit or placement in Army or Air National Guard from affecting their award amount. 
School of intellectual freedom: House File 437 and its companion, Senate File 127, have both been labeled as unfinished business. The House bill would have the University of Iowa establish a center for intellectual freedom, while the Senate version would direct the university to form a school instead. They would require the new center or school focus on “the historical ideas, traditions and texts that have shaped the American constitutional order and society,” according to bill language, and promote free speech, civil discourse, civic education and intellectual diversity.
Tuition freeze: House File 440 would, as amended by the Iowa House of Representatives, direct state universities to study the potential impacts of freezing tuition for students during their first year. Universities would also need to establish at least one three-year degree program and institute work plus programs, where students can work part time and have their tuition paid for by a qualified employer. It passed out of the Senate Education Committee on April 3. 
 Health care

Child care access: While the bills on Reynolds’ child care proposal, Senate File 445 and House File 623, were placed on the “unfinished business” calendar, Sinclair told reporters Thursday that amendments were expected on the measure before it would come to the Senate floor. The governor proposed shifting funding from existing Early Childhood Iowa (ECI) funding and federal Child Care and Development Fund Wrap Around Child Care funds to create three-year grants for full-day care for children, providing up to $100,000 annually for preschool providers and child care centers. The bill also would shift roughly $3.6 million in funding from the Shared Visions program for at-risk children from birth to age 5 to grants for at-risk 3- and 4-year-old children.
Health care training, access: The Iowa House passed Reynolds’ bill on health care, House File 972 in March. The bill directs Iowa HHS to draw down more than $150 million in federal funds to create 115 new medical residency slots at state teaching hospitals as part of an effort to address health care workforce shortages. The bill also seeks to increase rural health care access through efforts like increasing Medicaid rates for providers serving mothers and infants and establish a “hub-and-spoke” funding model for rural health care systems based off the Centers of Excellence Program.
HPV vaccine for minors: Senate File 304 and House File 384, placed on unfinished business, are a proposal to remove an exemption currently in Iowa law that allows minors to get vaccinations related to the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of sexually transmitted diseases or infections – primarily, the  human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. The bill would require minors have parental consent to receive these vaccines, in line with current requirements for most other vaccinations.
Medicaid work requirements: Senate File 615, legislation setting work requirements for Iowa’s expanded Medicaid program, has passed through both chambers, but has not yet made it to the governor’s desk. The bill would require people receiving health coverage through the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan, or IHAWP, work least 80 hours each month to retain eligibility. The requirement would apply to people between the ages of 19 to 64, with some exceptions, including people with a serious illness or injury and those with children under age 6.
Medical conscience: House File 571, passed by the Iowa House, would allow health care professionals, institutions and payors to not perform or pay for a health care service that goes against their conscience. While there are exemptions for emergency medical services, the bill states these entities cannot be held civilly, criminally or administratively liable if they say in “good faith” that they not to provide a service due to their beliefs.
Pharmacy benefit managers: Senate File 383 and House File 852, placed under “unfinished business,” would set new regulations on pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), the businesses that negotiate prescription drug costs between drug manufacturers, health insurance companies and pharmacies. The bills would require PBMs reimburse pharmacies for drug costs at the national or Iowa average acquisition cost and limit certain PBM practices like limiting the ability for these entities to restrict which pharmacies or pharmacists fill a person’s prescription based on certain criteria.
 Nutrition

Double Up Food Bucks: Senate File 232 was assigned to an appropriations subcommittee in February to appropriate $1 million to the Double Up Food Bucks program which allows recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to double their spending on produce. A House version of the bill, which would have created new rules for SNAP eligible foods, did not advance ahead of the funnel.  
House File 796 advanced from the House Floor as House File 970 and would appropriate $1 million to the Double Up Food Bucks program, but only if a waiver is granted to limit SNAP eligible foods. 
Rural grocery initiative: House File 550, would allocate $2 million to establish a grocer reinvestment program and a local produce processing grant program. The bill is in a House Appropriations Committee. 
School nutrition: Senate File 525 and House File 851, which advanced from the House, were attached and placed on unfinished business. The bill would seek a waiver from federal nutrition guidelines to create Iowa-specific guidelines that would focus school meals and nutrition education on the food sources of Iowa, like corn, pork and dairy. 
 State government

Citizenship verification for voting: House File 954, passed by the House and approved by the Senate State Government committee, is legislation brought forward by Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate following controversial guidance ahead of the 2024 election challenging the ballots of  2,176 registered voters as “potential noncitizens” based on state information. In March, Pate’s office said 277 of these individuals were confirmed to not hold U.S. citizenship.
The bill would allow the Secretary of State’s office to contract with state and federal agencies to verify the citizenship status of registered voters, a measure Pate said would help prevent situations like in 2024, when his office was unable to confirm these individuals’ citizenship status because the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services would not share access to citizenship information. The bill also would ban ranked choice voting and increase the eligibility requirements for gaining “political party” status on Iowa ballots.
County funding: House Study Bill 310 proposes a three-year moratorium on all programs and related funding from the Iowa Economic Development Authority (IEDA) the four Iowa counties with the highest population – currently, Polk, Linn, Scott and Johnson counties. The bill, a Ways and Means proposal, is not subject to the funnel deadline
Election recounts: House File 928 would make multiple changes to Iowa’s election recount system. Candidates would need a threshold of a 1% difference in votes — or 50 votes, whichever is less — in order to request a recount, and the state would only cover costs if the margin of initial results were within 0.1%. The bill, placed on “unfinished business” in the Senate, also would change the composition of election recount boards and set an earlier deadline for requesting recounts.
Property taxes: House Study Bill 313 and Senate Study Bill 1208 are companion bills on the proposal from Ways and Means Committee chairs Rep. Bobby Kauffman and Sen. Dan Dawson to address rising property taxes in the state. While there are many components to the bill, one of the top changes included is a move from the state’s “rollback” to a “revenue-restricted” system for calculating local property tax costs, capping the increase of most property tax levy rates to 2% each year. The measure would also shift $426 million funding for K-12 schools from local property taxes to the state.
While Republican legislative leaders said they aimed to move on property taxes this session, they said that the legislation was being reviewed to ensure that the measure will have its intended impact of lowering property tax costs for Iowans. Sinclair said, she would “like to see it get done this year, but we want it done right, rather than fast.”
Religious beliefs of adoptive, foster parents: Senate File 473 would prohibit Iowa HHS from requiring a prospective foster or adoptive parent to accept policies that conflict with their moral or religious beliefs on gender identity and sexual orientation when determining eligibility for becoming a child’s caretaker. Opponents to the bill said the measure could subject children in these circumstances to practices like conversion therapy, though supporters said language stating the department is allowed to consider the child and family of origin’s beliefs related to gender and sexuality when determining placement addresses these concerns.
 Labor and the workforce

Public sector union lists: Senate File 472 would allow Iowans to seek court action compelling government employers to provide a list of employees within a bargaining unit to the Employment Appeal Board (EAB), a step needed before union recertification votes. Some Republicans said the bill was needed because some employers have intentionally not submitted lists to preserve union representation in contract negotiations. The legislation was approved by the Senate in March and by the House Judiciary Committee Wednesday.
 Justice and public safety

Age verification for obscene materials: House File 864, passed by the House and placed on “unfinished business” in the Senate, would require pornography websites and other obscene-material distributors to implement “reasonable” age verification methods to ensure minors cannot access materials on their platforms.
Anti-SLAPP lawsuits: The House approved House File 472 in March, a bill providing protections against “strategic lawsuits against public participation,” or SLAPP lawsuits by allowing for expedited relief in court for actions related to First Amendment rights, like the freedom of speech and press. These lawsuits, typically filed against entities such as newspapers and activists, attempt to stop individuals and organizations from speaking publicly about certain issues by engaging them in expensive litigation.
Exposing minors to obscene materials: House File 306 would raise penalties for knowingly disseminating or exhibiting obscene materials to a minor. The first offense of the crime would be charged as a serious misdemeanor, raised to an aggravated misdemeanor for the second offense, and raised to a Class D felony for a third or subsequent offense with additional mandatory minimum confinement sentences. Minors charged for exhibiting or sharing obscene materials to another minor would face a serious misdemeanor charge but would not face the heightened charges for additional offenses.
Firearm age limits: House File 924, passed by the House and approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee, would lower the age limit for carrying a firearm from 21 to 18. The bill was amended to remove the ability for people between ages 18 to 21 to obtain a concealed carry permit.
Human smuggling: House File 572 would establish human smuggling as a criminal offense, defined as acts including transporting an undocumented person with the intent to conceal them from law enforcement, encouraging or coercing them to stay in the U.S. against the law by concealing or harboring them, and directing multiple individuals to be on agricultural lands without the landowner’s consent. The crime would be charged as a Class C felony with heightened penalties for cases involving monetary gain and the risk or cause of serious bodily injury or death. Some immigrant rights and religious advocates expressed concerns that the bill could lead to people providing aid to undocumented immigrants facing criminal charges.
Minors testifying in court: House Joint Resolution 9 and Senate Joint Resolution 9, placed under “unfinished business,” are Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird’s proposed constitutional amendment to allow minors and adults with certain disabilities to testify remotely against their alleged abusers using a closed-circuit television system. Bird said the measure, the first step in the process of amending the state constitution, was necessary to address an Iowa Supreme Court ruling that ruled children could not provide remote testimony in these circumstances because it violated the defendant’s constitutional right to confront their accuser.
Open records, meetings: House File 706 would raise penalties for violations of Iowa’s open meetings laws and require newly elected and appointed public officials to complete training on the state’s open meetings and records laws.
Police review boards: Senate File 311 would ban cities that have a civil service commission from adopting or establishing citizens’ boards that review the conduct of law enforcement officers. The measure, passed by the Senate and placed on “unfinished business” in the House, also makes changes to city civil service commissions and some processes for the legal processes surrounding disputes with a commission’s decisions or actions.
Service animals: House File 615 would make it easier for law enforcement to charge individuals for misrepresenting an animal as a service animal. The bill, passed by the House, would remove current requirements in state law that a person must first be given a warning that misrepresenting an animal as a service animal is illegal, and that the person being charged must know the animal is not actually a service animal or service animal in training.
 Natural resources

Governor’s energy bill: House File 834 and Senate File 585, known as the governor’s energy bill, would grant existing utility companies the right of first refusal to new transmission projects, create requirements for advanced ratemaking, and task DNR with regulating anaerobic digesters. The bills are in a House Ways and Means subcommittee and the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
 Pipelines

Eminent domain: House File 639 combined a number of pipeline-related bills, including House File 939 which would have adjusted the definition of a common carrier, House File 944 which broadened who could intervene in Iowa Utilities Commission proceedings, House File 923 which restricted the IUC from imposing sanctions on intervenors, House File 780 which limited hazardous liquid pipelines to one 25-year term, House File 240 which expanded insurance requirements for a pipeline and House File 790 which required IUC presence at all meetings and hearings.
The bill was significantly amended by a Senate panel to strike the common carrier definition, permit limits, and intervenor requirements. It also adjusted the insurance requirements, added a clause to allow operators to seek voluntary easements outside of the project corridor and would apply to all projects seeking eminent domain.
The bill is eligible for floor debate in the Senate.
Review of eminent domain: House File 763, would allow Iowa landowners to seek a legally binding explanation of their rights from a district court in the event of an eminent domain claim. The bill is in the House Ways and Means Committee. 
 
 Bills that died

 
 Education

Academic reviews: House File 420 would have required that state universities conduct reviews of all undergraduate and graduate academic programs, determine if and how they align with state workforce needs and submit a report to the General Assembly with recommendations for whether programs should be changed, eliminated or kept the same. The bill was never brought up on the House floor after being passed out of the House Higher Education Committee.
DEI courses in public universities: House File 269, formerly House Study Bill 53, would have barred state universities from requiring students to take a course related to diversity, equity and inclusion or critical race theory to satisfy general education requirements or earn any level of certification or degree, with certain exceptions. Employees of the institutions are also prohibited from requiring or incentivizing faculty to participate in DEI or critical race theory-related practices or include those topics in content. The bill died after Senate subcommittee passage. 
DEI in community colleges: House File 855 would have added community colleges to legislation passed last year barring state universities from funding or maintaining DEI offices. While this legislation did not make it through the second funnel, community colleges are included in other legislation that would prohibit state entities from using money to start or keep DEI offices and officers. 
DEI in private universities: House File 854 would have prohibited private universities from opening, funding or otherwise maintaining offices of diversity, equity and inclusion as a prerequisite for participation in the Iowa Tuition Grant program. It failed to make it through the second funnel. 
Financial information: House File 296 would have required universities to report and post online budgets lines, expenditures and goods and services totaling $50,000, as well as written contracts, salary reports and any expenditures made related to diversity, equity and inclusion. It has been referred back to the Iowa House Higher Education Committee alongside several other bills after failing to make it through the second funnel. 
Foreign funding: House File 575, which would have required state universities to put together an annual report on foreign funding sources, amounts and how funds were used, did not make it through the second funnel deadline. 
Iowa Tuition Grant changes: House File 867 would have required Iowa College Aid to allocate half of Iowa Tuition Grant dollars to students enrolled in degree programs connected to high-wage, high-demand job fields. Passed by the Iowa House Higher Education Committee in early March, the bill died in the second funnel before House debate took place.  
Loan programs: House File 703 would have required the Iowa student loan liquidity corporation, or ISL Education Lending, to report certain loan data to Iowa College Aid relating to the annual percentage rate of the Federal Direct PLUS loan compared to college family loans and partnership loans. If the loans had a lower APR than the federal loan program, Iowa College Aid would have needed to post the information online and share it with universities, which would add it to financial aid offers. The bill did not survive the second funnel after being passed by a Senate subcommittee.
Civil government course: House File 402, which failed to make it through the second funnel, would have required college students to take a course on American history and civil government in order to earn their baccalaureate degree. 
Penalties for pro-terrorism language on campus: House File 576 would have enabled public and private colleges to penalize certain nonimmigrant visa-holders for voicing support for, or encouraging others to support, terrorist organizations or actions. Penalties included suspension, expulsion and job termination. 
Tuition waivers: House File 577 would have resulted in state universities waiving tuition and fees and providing a $5,000-a-semester stipend for undergraduate students who earn the highest-possible scores on the ACT or SAT. It failed to pass through the second funnel. 
Syllabus reports: House File 270 would have directed state university instructors to post syllabi information online in a way the public can access, including the instructor’s name, planned lessons, course requirements and materials that will be used in class. The legislation stalled after being passed through the Iowa House Higher Education Committee and did not make it through the second funnel. 
Baseball: House File 153 would have directed Iowa State University and the University of Northern Iowa to reinstate men’s baseball teams. The bill did not survive the first funnel.
Bible studies in public schools: Legislation that directs the Iowa Board of Education to establish course standards for elective social studies classes on “Hebrew Scriptures or the Old or New Testament of the Bible” for students in grades 9 through 12 made it was approved by education committees in both chambers, but did not advance further in either chamber. House File 845 and Senate File 510 would have required the state board and school districts that chose to host classes on the Bible to remain in compliance with state and federal religious neutrality requirements.
Gulf of America: House lawmakers had considered House Study Bill 97, a proposal to require Iowa schools to replace references to the Gulf of Mexico with “Gulf of America” and “Denali” with “Mount McKinley” in classroom instruction and handouts in line with President Donald Trump’s order earlier in 2025.
Home schooling: Legislation that would have made changes to Iowa’s regulations on homeschooling that included allowing more than four unrelated children to receive private instruction from one person and requiring homeschooled students have proof of immunization and blood lead tests submitted by their parents did not advance past the committee level. House File 888 also proposed prohibiting Iowa world language classes from using gender-neutral language for languages that have a grammatical gender system, like Spanish.
Library associations: House File 880 would have changed library eligibility for Enrich Iowa funds provided through the State Library of Iowa to exclude members of a nonprofit organization – such as the Iowa Library Association or American Library Association — that “promotes federal and state legislation related to libraries and engages in advocacy efforts at the federal, state or local level.”
Sexual abuse education: Senate File 172, also called “Erin’s Law,” proposed directing the Department of Education to make guidelines for schools to use for teaching K-6 students about child sexual abuse. 
School technology: Senate File 516 proposed directing the Iowa Department of Education, alongside Iowa Department of Health and Human Services, to create a working group focused on school technology and its impacts on students’ “social and behavioral development, attention span, mental concentration and learning ability.”
Use of names, pronouns: Senate File 8 would have prohibited discipline for a teacher or another student who does not use a transgender student’s preferred name or pronouns if it differs from their legal name or pronouns corresponding with their legally assigned sex. Parents of transgender children said the measure conflicted with legislation passed in previous sessions that allowed families to direct schools to use a name different from their legal name.
Food dyes and margarine: House File 212 would have banned synthetic food dyes, margarine and other artificial additives from school meals, snacks and beverages. The bill was modeled after a similar law in California. 
 Health care

Child care workers: House File 382 proposed expanding Iowa’s laws limiting the use of minors in child care. In Iowa, minors as young as age 16 can work in child care centers without adult supervision. The bill proposed allowing minor workers to provide “flex care” for children from infancy to age 2 without direct supervision.
Abortion protection: A proposed constitutional amendment, Senate Joint Resolution 1, dealing with the right to reproductive care, died during the first funnel deadline. 
mRNA vaccines: A proposed ban on gene-based vaccines, like the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, died during the first funnel deadline. Senate File 360 would have set penalties for healthcare providers that administer vaccines that use nucleic acids like messenger RNA (mRNA), with fines of $500 for each violation.
Medication abortion restrictions: House File 775 proposed restrictions on abortion medication by mail. The legislation would have required abortion medications be distributed in-person exclusively, and would have required patients give written consent for the medication acknowledging they understand the risks and potential to reverse an abortion through medication.
Nursing homes inspectors: Senate File 532 proposed several nursing home care changes, including a $600,000 increase in state funding for 30 additional care-facility inspectors and an increase in penalties for violations of certain regulations by health care facilities. The bill also proposed banning Medicaid-certified nursing homes in Iowa from requiring that residents or families agree to arbitration instead of seeking legal action over negligent care claims.
Personal needs allowance: Senate File 476 proposed raising the monthly personal needs allowance for Medicaid beneficiaries in nursing homes from $50 to $65 per month. The allowances are used by residents at care facilities to pay for items such as cellphone service, hairdressing, clothing, cable TV and snacks.
Vaccine manufacturer immunity: House File 712 was a proposal requiring vaccine manufacturers waive their immunity from lawsuits over certain vaccine injuries that are currently covered through a federal, no-fault compensation program under the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act.
 State government

Annexing southern Minnesota: Senate File 354, introduced by Sen. Mike Bousselot, would have directed the state to begin negotiations with Minnesota for the purchase of nine southern Minnesota counties. The bill did not receive a subcommittee hearing.
Artificial intelligence: House Study Bill 294, which representatives noted was a “work in progress” would have created protections from election materials produced with artificial intelligence, or “algorithmic discrimination” caused by AI. The bill advanced from the House Economic Growth and Technology Committee before the first funnel, but chairman Rep. Ray Sorenson told committee members Monday he expects to continue working on the bill next year. 
Citizenship on IDs: House File 439  would have required that driver’s licenses and non-operator identification cards list a person’s citizenship status. While critics said the measure could lead to discrimination, some poll workers told lawmakers the inclusion of citizenship status on IDs could help them confirm a person’s eligibility to vote.
Homelessness: A proposal discussed in early March that would criminalize sleeping and camping on public property did not advance. House Study Bill 286 and Senate Study Bill 1195, supported by the Austin, Texas-based Cicero Institute, would have allowed cities and counties to create designated spaces for homeless encampments and create “drug-free homeless service zones.” The legislation also would have allowed for criminal charges against facility operators providing shelter and services to individuals experiencing homelessness that also allow people to possess or use a controlled substance in their facility.
 Justice and public safety

Age verification for social media: House File 798 proposed requiring social media companies to obtain parental permission before a minor was allowed to create an account on their platform. Parents and guardians would also have been  required to have access to a minor’s posts and messages on the platform, with the ability to revoke access at any time to the account.
Booking photos: House File 47 would have limited the public release of police mugshots until after the person arrested was convicted of the crime for which they were arrested, with exceptions in cases where a person was a fugitive or when the photo’s release would help law enforcement apprehend the individual.
Death penalty: Iowa lawmakers did not advance Senate File 320, a bill to reestablish the death penalty in Iowa in cases where a person was convicted of first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer.
ICE agreements: House Study Bill 187 proposed requiring all Iowa law enforcement agencies to enter into agreements with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to participate in immigration law enforcement efforts. The bill did not advance past the first funnel following concerns expressed by Latino and immigrant rights advocates as well as law enforcement officers.
Immigration law enforcement: House File 946, which passed the House, would have stated that law enforcement officers who “knowingly and intentionally” fail to comply with the state laws on federal immigration enforcement would be subject to investigation by the attorney general. The measure was significantly amended from its initial language, which would have stated law enforcement in violation of the state law could face a Class D felony charge. The bill was not taken up by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Obscene performances: House File 891 would have created a new criminal charge for knowingly exposing a minor to an obscene performance or admitting a minor to premises with obscene performances, following obscenity definitions under existing Iowa code. The bill was amended heavily from an earlier version that focused on penalties related to minors attending drag shows, which were defined as “performances where “the main aspect of the performance is a performer who exhibits a gender identity that is different than the performer’s gender assigned at birth through the use of clothing, makeup, accessories, or other gender signifiers.”
Obscenity laws in libraries: House File 521 would have repealed current obscenity law exemptions for educational institutions and libraries. Opponents said the measure could have subject public libraries to costly litigation over material that is not “obscene” under Iowa law, but that members of the community did not want to be available through public libraries.
Pesticide lawsuits: Grassley told reporters Thursday that legislation providing legal protections for pesticide manufacturers from certain lawsuits, including claims that pesticide products gave individuals cancer, did not have the support needed to pass in the Iowa House. Senate File 394 was passed by the Senate in late March.
Traffic cameras: House File 764 proposed banning local governments from contracting with third-party vendors to collect traffic camera fines.
 Natural resources

Chemtrails: House File 927 proposed a prohibition on the intentional emission of air contaminants that intentionally impact “temperature, weather, or the intensity of sunlight,” legislation that some critics said was tied to the chemtrails conspiracy theory. One of the suggested amendments to the bill, introduced by Rep. Adam Zabner, would have directed the Iowa Department of Natural resources to conduct a study to “research the existence of Bigfoot in the state.”
Beneficial use water permits: House File 861, formerly House File 480, would have required the Iowa Department of Natural Resources to evaluate the “beneficial use” of a water use permit application on a case-by-case basis, rather than a categorical determination. The bill was sent back to the House Natural Resources Committee. 
Community solar: House File 404, would have connected small solar fields, built in brownfield sites, on top of commercial warehouses or in underutilized farmland, into the electric power grid. Community members could purchase shares of the solar project and then receive waivers on their electric bills from the operating utility company. The bill did not see floor debate despite being eligible since early February. Existing utility companies were opposed to the bill and said non-affected ratepayers would have to shoulder some of the maintenance costs.  
Land acquisition: Senate File 553 and House File 714, which would have blocked the DNR from purchasing land at auction, or acquiring land from anyone other than a willing donor or seller, did not advance to the floor of either chamber.
PFAS: House File 723, which would have required water treatment plants to test sewage sludge for PRFAS, or perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl, and notify landowners if the sludge, destined for land application, contained PFAS. The bill gained a subcommittee meeting after the first funnel, but was not heard by the House Environmental Protection Committee. 
Gardening: Senate File 494 would have prohibited state and local governments from enacting rules or ordinances that prohibit Iowans from establishing or maintaining a residential garden. The bill advanced from the Senate floor and from a House subcommittee, but was not heard in the House Local Government Committee. 
 Pipelines

Climate change language: House File 302, would have precluded the Iowa Utilities Commission from considering climate change when issuing a permit for a hazardous liquid pipeline. 
Eminent domain for CO2 pipelines: House File 943 was one of two pipeline-related bills to advance from the House. This bill would have blocked pipelines carrying liquified carbon dioxide from receiving eminent domain rights in the state. 
Office of the Consumer Advocate: House File 578, which would have restored the Office of the Consumer Advocate as an independent office, advanced from the House, and was assigned to a subcommittee which did not schedule a hearing.
 
 Sent to the governor

 
Gender identity protections: The first bill the governor signed this session was Senate File 418, removing gender identity from the Iowa Civil Rights Act. Previously under the state civil rights code, transgender people and others were given protections against discrimination on the basis of their gender identity in areas such as employment, housing, public accommodations and education. The law also removes transgender Iowans’ ability to change their designated sex on their birth certificate after receiving gender-affirming medical treatment, and changes definitions in Iowa law for “sex” and “gender.”
Hands-free cellphones:  Reynolds signed into law Senate File 22, a ban on the handheld use of cellphones and other electronic devices while driving outside of voice-activated or handsfree modes. The distracted driving bill was approved by the Iowa House in March after several years where the bill failed to advance through the chamber. 
Open beverage containers: In March, Reynolds also signed into law House File 181, a measure expanding Iowa’s ban on open containers of alcoholic drinks in vehicles’ passenger compartments. The law now includes beverages containing tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. 
Workforce training contract requirements: The governor signed Senate File 603, a bill that prohibits state agencies and local governments from mandating requirements related to  apprenticeship training for contractors outside of legal obligations. Other “restrictions, qualifications, or requirements” imposed by local entities on contractors, subcontractors, developers and apprentices would also be barred.

Chuck Grassley introduced legislation this week requiring more congressional oversight of such decisions. The president announced he was setting a baseline 10% levy on all international imports Wednesday, effective April 5, with higher tariffs on some countries taking effect April 9. The &#8220;Liberation [&#8230;]","Sen. Chuck Grassley appeared on ""Iowa Press"" on Sept. 15, 2023. (Screenshot via Iowa PBS)In light of Wednesday’s tariff announcement by President Donald Trump, U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley introduced legislation this week requiring more congressional oversight of such decisions.
The president announced he was setting a baseline 10% levy on all international imports Wednesday, effective April 5, with higher tariffs on some countries taking effect April 9.
The “Liberation Day” announcement triggered the largest one-day drop in the U.S. stock market since June 2020 and has been met with heavy criticism from American businesses. As part of the response Thursday, Grassley introduced the “American Trade Review Act of 2025” alongside Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington.
The legislation seeks to restore some Congressional authority over tariffs, including requirements that Congress must pass a joint resolution approving a new tariff within 60 days. The legislation would also allow Congress to vote to end tariffs at any time through a resolution of disapproval. The bill would require that within 48 hours of taking action on tariffs, the president must give Congress an explanation of the reason for implementing or raising a tariff along with an analysis of the potential impact on American businesses and consumers.
Grassley said the measure would shift important powers over foreign economic policy from the president to Congress.
“For too long, Congress has delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch,” Grassley said in a statement. “Building on my previous efforts as Finance Committee chairman, I’m joining Sen. Cantwell to introduce the bipartisan Trade Review Act of 2025 to reassert Congress’ constitutional role and ensure Congress has a voice in trade policy.”
U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson of Iowa also weighed in on the tariffs Thursday, telling reporters she believes tariffs are needed to ensure fairer negotiations between the U.S. and other countries moving forward.
“The president’s goal here is to not only get other countries to the negotiating table, but really focused on helping to create more opportunity,” Hinson said, according to the Des Moines Register. “… After four years of high inflation — and really no new trade opportunities, no new manufacturing opportunities — that’s what they’re going to see.”
Iowa Democrats have criticized Iowa’s U.S. House delegation — all Republicans — for not pushing back against Trump’s tariff policies, which Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said will hurt Iowa’s economy.
“It’s clear that Iowa’s representatives in Washington are either inept or too afraid to fight back — even when our economy is struggling,” Hart said in a statement. “I’m sure we’ll hear expressions of ‘concern,’ but actions speak louder than words and they voted to give away the farm to a president more focused on tariffs than lower prices. Iowans need independent voices that will do what’s best for Iowa and take us in a more sensible direction.”
Hinson bill would codify Trump order on Treasury Department anti-fraud, waste practices
Hinson introduced legislation Thursday to codify an executive order made by Trump in March titled “Protecting America’s Bank Account Against Fraud, Waste, and Abuse.” The bill directs the U.S. Treasury Department to work with the Office of Management and Budget to establish recertification and pre-award verification procedures that agencies must use before payments are disbursed, and to “minimize administrative barriers to accessing and using data to prevent fraud and improper payments.”
Agencies are also directed to consolidate financial systems under the order and submit compliance plans to the Treasury Department detailing their efforts to update systems. The bill would also require agencies to share payment information verification and other relevant data for the purpose of identifying fraud or improper payments.
Hinson said in a news release the Government Accountability Office’s estimates the federal government loses between $233 billion and $521 billion each year due to fraud and said that was her motivation to introduce the bill.
“That’s hundreds of billions of your tax dollars flushed down the drain without swamp bureaucrats blinking an eye,” Hinson said in statement. “President Trump’s executive order to prevent improper payments is a great step to end this abuse, and my bill will make this effort permanent to ensure your hard-earned tax dollars are not wasted.”
Nunn backs bill allowing SNAP purchases of hot, ready meals
U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn was a part of the bipartisan group introducing the “Hot Foods Act” this week, a bill permitting the purchase of hot, prepared foods through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
SNAP, the food benefits program for low-income families, seniors and people with disabilities, currently has restrictions in place that stops recipients from purchasing hot or prepared meals, while allowing benefits to be spent on cold or frozen versions of the same food.
The legislation, led by U.S. Rep. Grace Meng, a New York Democrat, would remove limits on hot and ready-to-eat meals, which she said would provide families on SNAP the ability to buy food that suits their needs.
“The Hot Foods Act removes this dated rule preventing people from purchasing hot foods with SNAP, giving flexibility to working parents, people with disabilities, and the many hard-working Americans who need to put food on the table every day,” Meng said. “I am proud to work across the aisle to make this commonsense change.”
In a news release Thursday, Nunn called the bill a “commonsense fix” that will help Iowans on SNAP access convenient, nutritious meals.
“No family should have to choose between hunger and dignity,” said Rep. Nunn. ”Iowans deserve the flexibility to use their nutrition benefits on warm, ready-to-eat meals that make life a little easier — especially for working parents.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-15-at-6.24.37-PM-1024x615.png,,,2025-04-04 16:05:44.287538

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)The Trump administration’s move to gut a library-supporting federal agency could make a victory for backers of the South Dakota State Library short-lived.
Last year, State Library advocates were aghast at a budget plan from then-Gov. Kristi Noem that would’ve hollowed out the Pierre-based organization, which operates under the umbrella of the state Department of Education.
The Legislature softened the cuts during its annual lawmaking session that ended earlier this month, keeping the State Library alive and eligible for a federal grant that funds much of the organization’s budget. 
Then, the day after lawmakers went home in mid-March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing the head of the Institute for Museum and Library Services, or IMLS — which provides the grant — to cut its operations to the “maximum extent allowable by law.” 
That has State Library advocates worried about its future again.
Legislative committee softens budget blow to SD State Library, but concerns remain

Among other duties, the State Library handles interlibrary loans, pays for databases that are accessible at no cost through any public library in the state, provides support for summer reading programs and organizes professional development workshops. It also offers Braille and talking book services for readers with disabilities.
Noem’s budget plan, unveiled in December, would have pared down every piece of the State Library’s operations except those last two items. The proposed cuts were deep enough to dash about $1.3 million in federal matching dollars from the IMLS. That money, on top of the state’s $1 million contribution, was enough to fund the State Library’s border-to-border operations and pay its 21 employees.
Noem wasn’t around to fight for her proposal, however. She left the state to take a job as head of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security before state lawmakers dug into the details of her budget.
The Legislature ultimately worked with the administration of her successor, Gov. Larry Rhoden, to fashion a compromise that spared the jobs of all but 3.5 State Library employees. 
The $850,000 in state funding approved in the deal with the state Education Department was enough to preserve IMLS grant funding, even as the Legislature dissolved the citizen board that oversees the State Library. Summer reading program support, training for librarians and most of the databases were saved in the deal.
Nancy Van Der Weide, the Education Department’s spokeswoman, said databases from EBSCO, World Book, BookFlix, Peterson’s Test Prep, SIRS Issues Research, Discoverer, Research Library, U.S. Newsstream, and CultureGrams will remain available to South Dakota citizens through the State Library. 
State unsure about impact of Trump action
The IMLS dollars that buoy South Dakota’s State Library serve similar purposes in every state. Grants from the organization also support curation and collection management activities at museums and local libraries.
Congress last authorized IMLS grant funding in 2018, during President Donald Trump’s first term in office. There’s money available through the 2025 federal fiscal year, which began Oct. 1.
Trump’s order gave the agency a week to craft a plan to comply with the edict. IMLS Acting Director Keith E. Sonderling has already placed all employees of IMLS on administrative leave.
South Dakota’s State Library has its funding in hand from federal fiscal year 2024, according to Van Der Weide. The department “is waiting on a grant award for FY 2025,” she wrote, referring to the current round of funding.
Congress authorized grant funding through FY 2025, she said. But as a department, Van Der Weide said, “we do not have a clear indication” as to the impact of the Trump executive order.
Library group reaction, union concerns
The congressional authorization is some comfort to Elizabeth Fox, head of the South Dakota Library Association. That group’s membership rallied opposition to Noem’s proposed cuts, both before and during the legislative session. 
The words “allowable by law” in the Trump order and the knowledge that another year of federal grant money is written into the law helped calm — for her, at least — some of the “more extreme” reactions that followed news of the IMLS targeting.
Trump order would gut agency that gives library grants to SD

Fox was thinking about the next round of IMLS funding long before Noem’s December budget address. Every five-year funding cycle for the federal agency represents a moment of action for library advocates around the nation, Fox said.
“We have known for a year now that we were looking at getting that renewed,” Fox said. “We knew we were going to be having this discussion.”
Others remain concerned, especially after the news on administrative leave for IMLS staff. That move is likely to complicate the agency’s performance of its statutory obligations, according to a federal employees union called the American Federation of Government Employees. 
“In the absence of staff, all work processing 2025 applications has ended,” the group’s local chapter wrote in a statement to South Dakota Searchlight. “The status of previously awarded grants is unclear. Without staff to administer the programs, it is likely that most grants will be terminated.”
Museum director: IMLS director statement ‘terrifying’
Conor McMahon heads the Journey Museum in Rapid City. His organization got $50,000 from IMLS a few years ago to help fund an exhibit on the historic, deadly Rapid City floods of 1972.
The federal agency also serves as a funding source for unglamorous museum necessities like new shelving, McMahon said. That’s a topic the Journey director expects to broach with the Rapid City Council in the coming months to deal with a dearth of space in the organization’s building. 
Trump’s firings reach into a Rapid City museum and derail an expert’s career

“If the city doesn’t fund this, IMLS would have been our second source,” McMahon said.
The Trump administration’s administrative leave order for IMLS employees was set for 90 days. Even if those employees return to work at the end of 90 days, or at the order of a federal judge, McMahon is not encouraged by a statement from Sonderling, the IMLS acting director. Sonderling is also the deputy secretary for the Department of Labor. Sonderling said he’s committed to “revitalize IMLS and restore focus on patriotism, ensuring we preserve our country’s core values, promote American exceptionalism and cultivate love of country in future generations.”
To McMahon and other museum and library advocates around the country, that sounds like a pledge to politicize the work of preserving and maintaining the nation’s history and culture.
For museum curators and library professionals who aim to offer an honest, unvarnished and nuanced perspective to the public, McMahon said, “I don’t think you could find a more terrifying statement than that.”

Free.,Judge orders return of Maryland father deported by mistake to El Salvador prison,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judge-orders-return-maryland-father-deported-mistake-el-salvador-prison,,"GREENBELT, MARYLAND — A federal judge in Maryland Friday ordered the Trump administration to return a national from El Salvador by April 7 who was erroneously deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador, despite an order blocking such removal.The ruling from U.S. District Court of Maryland Judge Paula Xinis sets up a fight with the Trump administration. Officials have admitted the deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia of Beltsville, Maryland, was a mistake, but have stood by their actions.The case could also mean that the more than 250 Venezuelan men in a separate case who were removed under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 without due process can be returned to the U.S. Cheers could be heard outside the courthouse after the order, as dozens of protestors waited for the decision.‘It was unconstitutional’Xinis, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, said “there is no evidence to hold” Abrego Garcia at the notorious prison Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, known as CECOT, and even noted his March 12 arrest by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had no basis for removal.“That means from the moment he was seized, it was unconstitutional,” Xinis said.The attorney representing the Department of Justice, Erez Reuveni, said the Trump administration is not challenging the merits of the case and the only argument it has is that the Maryland court lacks jurisdiction because Abrego Garcia is in the custody of El Salvador.Xinis pressed on what grounds Abrego Garcia was removed to the prison.Reuveni said he has no idea and was not given any information from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.She asked why Abrego Garcia could not be returned to the United States, which is what his family was seeking in Friday’s preliminary injunction hearing.Reuveni said that he has asked officials that same question, and has not received an answer that is ""satisfactory.""Reuveni made one request to the court, that Xinis give the administration of President Donald Trump 24 hours to try to rectify the situation.U.S. paying $6 millionAttorneys for Abrego Garcia are not only asking for him to be returned, but for the Trump administration to cease payments to the mega-prison for his detainment. The White House has stated it’s paying the government of El Salvador $6 million to detain nearly 300 men.Reuveni said because Abrego Garcia is in custody in El Salvador, he is no longer in U.S. custody and therefore cannot be retrieved.Xinis pushed back on that argument, noting that the U.S. and El Salvador have a contract to detain the men at the prison.Reuveni said that it’s not a contract the U.S. and El Salvador have.Simon Y. Sandoval-Moshenberg, the attorney for Abrego Garcia, contended that “there is significant coordination between the two governments.”He noted that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has filmed herself while visiting CECOT and Secretary of State Marco Rubio has a close relationship with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele.Xinis said to Reuveni that because the U.S. is paying El Salvador $6 million to detain the men, “I can draw the logical argument that the U.S. is the payer.”She asked Reuveni if he has any evidence to show her that contradicts that knowledge.“The government made a choice here to produce no evidence,” Reuveni said.Wartime law invokedOn March 15, three deportation flights left for El Salvador with two planes carrying Venezuelans removed under the wartime law and a third plane that carried nationals from El Salvador, including Abrego Garcia.A 2019 order from an immigration judge deemed that Abrego Garcia should be removed from the U.S. However, he was granted protection because it was more ""likely than not that he would be persecuted by gangs in El Salvador"" if he were returned, according to court documents.Attorneys for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement could have challenged that decision, but did not. Instead, Abrego Garcia was required to check in with ICE every year, including earlier this year.When Abrego Garcia was driving his 5-year-old son home on March 12, he was pulled over by ICE and informed that his “status had changed,” and was quickly transferred to a detention center in Texas. Within three days he was on a plane to CECOT, despite the order barring his removal to El Salvador.Xinis asked Reuveni under what authority Abrego Garcia was removed and he said he didn’t know. All he was given was a declaration by ICE Acting Field Office Director of Enforcement and Removal Operations Robert L. Cerna, he said.“This was an oversight, and the removal was carried out in good faith based on the existence of a final order of removal and Abrego-Garcia’s purported membership in MS-13,” Cerna wrote in a Monday court filing.Xinis said if the government could not cite what legal authority he was being removed under, “then there is no basis to have seized him in the first place. That’ how I'm looking at it.”ICE and the Department of Justice have admitted the removal was an ""administrative error,” but the Trump administration has stood by its decision.White House gets involvedVice President J.D. Vance wrote on social media, without evidence, that Abrego Garcia was a convicted member of the MS-13 gang and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt this week echoed Vance.""The administration maintains the position that this individual who was deported to El Salvador and will not be returning to our country was a member of the brutal and vicious MS-13 gang,"" Leavitt said.Because of those comments by Leavitt, Sandoval-Moshenberg asked the judge to “keep the government on a tight leash.”Abrego Garcia does not have a criminal record in the U.S., El Salvador or anywhere else, Sandoval-Moshenberg has stated.Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. without legal authorization in 2011, fleeing violence in his home country of El Salvador, according to court records. Six years later while he was looking for work at a Home Depot in Hyattsville, Maryland, he was taken into custody by Prince George’s County Police Department.While there, he was questioned about gang affiliation and law enforcement did not believe he was not a member of the MS-13 gang, according to court records.The evidence officers submitted included Abrego Garcia wearing a Chicago Bulls hat, a hoodie and a statement from a confidential informant that stated he was a member of MS-13, according to court documents.While he was never charged with, or convicted of being, in a gang, he was kept in ICE detention while his case proceeded before an immigration judge.",,,,2025-04-04 16:05:44.287538

Fifty-five protests are planned throughout Ohio for this weekend, and more were being added as of mid-morning on Friday, an organizer said. They’re part of more than 1,000 protests of the Trump administration slated for all 50 states and Washington, D.C.
Organizers have posted an interactive map of where they’re planned.
A backlash has been building to the nascent administration’s actions that many see as harming democracy, veterans, the public health, immigrants, consumers, retirees, the working poor, scientific research, the national parks, federal employees and others. With global markets plummeting in the wake of the deep, sweeping tariffs Trump unilaterally imposed this week, antipathy toward him and his administration is likely to grow.

Those sponsoring this weekend’s rallies include dozens of advocacy organizations, including the AFL-CIO, Americans for Financial Reform, Common Cause, the Consumer Federation of America, Indivisible, and Planned Parenthood.
A website for the demonstrations explains their goal.
“Donald Trump and Elon Musk believe this country belongs to them,” it says. “They’re taking everything they can get their hands on, and daring the world to stop them. On Saturday, April 5th, we’re taking to the streets nationwide to fight back with a clear message: Hands Off!”
It adds, “A core principle of Hands Off! is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to de-escalate any potential confrontations with those who disagree with our values, and to act lawfully at these events.”
In Ohio at least, protests are planned for Saturday and Sunday. One is slated for noon on Saturday on the Western Plaza of the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus. Others are planned for Cleveland, Cincinnati, Dayton, Akron, and Toledo, in addition to smaller cities and towns such as Portsmouth, Marietta, Sandusky, and others.
Mia Lewis of Common Cause Ohio provided a Facebook page listing the events that are being planned for the Buckeye State. It continues to be updated, she said.
“For many people, this will be the first protest they have attended,” Lewis said in an email. “They are coming out not to tear anything down, but to stand up for the Constitution, for the rule of law, for our democracy. Enough is enough!”
She added that a broad swath of Ohioans are expected.
“The folks planning to attend range from the elderly — I’ve had many questions about accessible parking — to young families bringing their children. Yes, WE THE PEOPLE are showing up to say enough is enough! Hands off our government and our democracy.”

Chris Gildon of Puyallup is the chief budget writer for Senate Republicans. ( Photo by Ryan Berry/Washington State Standard)Negotiations on a new state budget got a step more serious Thursday. And, Republicans argue, more secretive.
The state Senate voted to request that the two chambers form a conference committee for the operating budget.
If the House agrees, and it will in the next few days, six lawmakers – four Democrats and two Republicans – will be charged with reconciling differences in spending plans approved in each chamber. The chief budget writers for each caucus will serve on the panel.
Here’s the rub for the GOP. 
They know employing a conference committee at this stage is pretty much standard operating procedure. They did it when they were in the majority.
They also understand it isn’t like other committees. It won’t meet in public until there is a final version of the budget ready to be voted on. And whatever the committee delivers cannot be amended.
Republicans are unlikely to be invited to many meetings. Maybe none. Democrats will huddle behind closed doors with their leadership and strike deals. They can involve Republicans at any and every step if they want, but more likely they will brief them when they feel it is necessary.
“You’re going to have basically four legislators in a room likely making very dramatic changes to the operating budget, changes none of us will ever have a chance to amend,” Sen. Chris Gildon, R-Puyallup, said on the Senate floor. Gildon is the lead Republican budget writer and will be a committee member.
“It is closed to the public. It is not transparent,” he said, adding “it will further erode trust in state government.”
Sen. June Robinson, D-Everett, chair of the Senate Ways and Means Committee and the Democrats’ lead budget writer, disagreed with the characterization.
“The conference report process is something the Legislature does every year for the budget and other bills,” she said in a statement.
“I have worked closely with my Republican counterparts throughout the budget process and am open to discussions with them at any point going forward,” Robinson added. “All of that is taken into consideration in negotiations.”

Patrick Morrisey’s proposed budget report, which differs greatly from the one proposed and approved by the House of Delegates on Friday, April 4, 2025. (Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)The West Virginia House of Delegates on Friday passed its version of the state budget for the upcoming year with several marked differences between the one initially requested by Gov. Patrick Morrisey at the beginning of the session.
With three members absent and not voting, the budget bill passed the House 80-17. Eight Republican delegates — Dels. Chris Anders, R-Berkeley; Elias Coop-Gonzalez, R-Randolph; Henry Dillon, R-Wayne; Laura Kimble, R-Harrison; Bill Ridenour, R-Jefferson; Adam Vance, R-Wyoming and Lisa White, R-Berkeley — joined the chamber’s nine Democrats in voting against the proposed budget.
As proposed, the House’s budget — House Bill 2026 — is based on the previous year’s budget, continuing a tradition of relatively “flat” budgets for the state of West Virginia. It totals about $5.127 billion in base spending.
Morrisey has been critical of this tradition of “flat” budgets. Before the legislative session started, he said the practice has been used to falsely inflate the state’s revenues, making it seem that there is more money on hand in the state through the use of one-time funds that go to necessary programs but that are not included in estimated spending needs.
He said former Gov. Jim Justice’s approach to the budget bred long-term problems that he was now inheriting. In January, Morrisey’s office projected that there would be a $400 million budget hole that lawmakers would need to contend with due to that reliance on one-time funds.
  Del. Vernon Criss, R-Wood
But Del. Vernon Criss, who serves as the chair of the House Committee on Finance, never believed that budget hole actually existed. On Friday, in response to questions from Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha, who asked whether that $400 million budget deficit was still a factor in the proposed state budget, Criss reiterated his beliefs.
“It never was,” said Criss, R-Wood.
Earlier this year, Morrisey’s office estimated that revenues for the coming fiscal year would total around $5.323 billion. The governor’s version of the budget had all of those potential dollars being spent, making the largest difference between the House’s budget and Morrisey’s the inclusion of surplus funds. As proposed, the House’s budget holds nearly $129 million as surplus spending that could be allocated later if the funds remain available by the end of this fiscal year.
Criss, who has been vocally critical of Morrisey’s governorship throughout this session, said the governor’s proposed budget was problematic in that it didn’t include that “cushion” of surplus funds that can act as a safety net if revenue falls short and removed line items that allow the Legislature to better track funding allocations and the use of state dollars. 
“The governor’s budget was going to spend every dollar and not have any reserve account,” Criss said. “He also collapsed all of the line items, which takes away our job of making sure we are watching the dollars. We appropriate the dollars — that’s our job. When we got his budget, based upon his pro forma sheet, it was useless.” 
Proposed amendments and line item funding changes
Before its passage on Friday, members of the House considered 10 amendments to the proposed budget bill, adopting only two of them.
The first of those adopted amendments came from Del. Joe Statler, R-Monongalia, and added $2 million to the Office of Emergency Medical Services for training and support of the state’s EMS.
The second adopted amendment was introduced by Del. Michael Hite, R-Berkeley, and changed how funds are used and appropriated for several of the state Department of Human Services’ waiver programs, including the Intellectual and/or Developmental Disabilities Waiver program.
All of the other eight amendments voted down by lawmakers during the budget process were introduced by Democrats. All but one were voted down via voice vote.
If approved, those amendments would have:

Transferred $50 million into the West Virginia Flood Resiliency Trust Fund — a currently unfunded budget line — from the Revenue Shortfall Reserve Fund. With six members absent, lawmakers voted 75-19 against the amendment. Their vote came just weeks after devastating flooding hit the state’s southern coalfields, taking lives and damaging dozens of buildings beyond repair.
Added $10 million to the Water Development Authority to be used for improvements to the state’s many distressed and failing water systems.
Added $32 million in funding for child care subsidies, which lawmakers have stressed over the last two years are needed in the state. Despite that need — and requests from businesses to make the program a priority in order to support working parents — little work has been done by the Legislature on the issue and only about $6.3 million is currently allocated in the House’s budget for child care.
Put $20 million into workforce development grants to provide summer employment for teens. That fund is zeroed out in the House’s budget due to the expiration of federal funds.
Reinstated the state’s Herbert Henderson Office of Minority Affairs with a nearly $400,000 allocation. That office was completely removed in the budget in the wake of an executive order from Morrisey banning all diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the state.
Added $5 million in funding for West Virginia State University. 
Added $15 million in funding for West Virginia University.
Increased various allocations to the state’s waiver programs, including an additional $1 million for the IDD Waiver program, $32 million for Title XIX for Seniors Citizens waiver program and $1.3 million for the Traumatic Brain Injury Waiver program.

The House’s proposed budget — as it remains flat — had only a few increases for budget lines throughout. House counsel said at a committee meeting earlier this week that one of those, an additional $30 million for the state Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections, is “just to meet their operational requirements.”
Other increases include an additional $40 million for the employer share for the Public Employees Insurance Agency, $7 million for the Department of Health’s Birth to Three program, $1 million to the House and Senate for auditing services and a $7 million bump for the state’s HOPE Scholarship program, among other small increases. 
And while an additional $90 million is being allocated to the state Department of Human Services — replacing some dollars cut in last year’s budget — the department is still underfunded as it deals with an ongoing foster care crisis.
Under the House’s proposal, DoHS will receive just about $121 million for foster care. Morrisey’s budget had about $182 million for foster care, higher than what the House is offering but still less than what the department said it needs.
The agency also faces high vacancy rates of Child Protective Service workers, something the House took into consideration across the board in all agencies in its proposed budget. Agencies with continuously high vacancy rates, according to counsel for the House, were subject to a 2% budget reduction, totalling about $8 million in savings.
Other spending decreases in the House’s budget include an $11 million drop in state dollars in the school aid formula, a $15 million reduction in funds given to WVU and about a $1.2 million decrease in funds for the Judges Retirement Systems.
The Herbert Henderson Office of Minority Affairs no longer exists in the House’s budget while the Department of Arts, Culture and History is moving under the Department of Tourism, and the Department of Economic Development is joining with the Commerce Department. Those agency closures and mergers reflect about $300,000 in savings, according to previous budget presentations.
What’s next
With the House’s vote Friday, its version of the state budget heads to the Senate for consideration.
Meanwhile, however, the Senate is still considering its own version of the state budget, which looks much more similar to Morrisey’s initially proposed budget than the House’s.
On Thursday, the Senate Committee on Finance approved the Senate’s budget proposal. That budget — Senate Bill 300 — is scheduled to be on first reading in the Senate on Monday. 
The Senate’s budget sticks with Morrisey’s proposed $5.3 billion in general revenue spending, however priorities for that spending look a bit different. 
During a press conference with reporters on Thursday, Morrisey said he wasn’t concerned that the two budget proposals circulating around the Legislature hold stark differences. In response to a question from Ogden Newspapers’ Steven Allen Adams, Morrisey said meetings have been occurring regularly between his team and leadership in both of the Legislature’s chambers.
“I think what you have here is a process,” Morrisey said. “The House has an important opinion, the Senate has an important opinion, the executive has an important opinion and so you have these three groups that come together and then you try to reach a budget that everyone agrees on.”
The Legislature is scheduled to adjourn sine die at midnight on Saturday, April 12.

(Photo by Peter Dazeley/Getty Images)The Iowa Dental Board has canceled a scheduled disciplinary hearing for a dentist who is alleged to have contributed to a patient’s death.
The board has also pulled from its website a previously published description of the alleged wrongdoing that led to the death.
In September 2024, the board notified dentist Robert Wolf of Swisher that it intended to deny his application for a permit to use moderate sedation on patients. At the time, the board alleged that on Jan. 26, 2024, Wolf had participated in dental surgery on a patient who suffered a medical emergency in the office and subsequently died.
The board alleged Wolf was the only dentist in the operating room while an advanced registered nurse practitioner administered and monitored anesthesia. “During the procedure, (Wolf) facilitated the practice of an unlicensed dentist and supervised the administration of anesthesia without having the proper credentials,” the board alleged.
One week after the death, Wolf filed his application for a permit to use moderate sedation on patients. After the board sent Wolf a “preliminary notice” announcing its intent to deny the application, Wolf indicated he intended to pursue the matter, and a hearing before the board was scheduled for this month.
Wolf subsequently withdrew his application and in March the board issued an order canceling the planned hearing.
In recent weeks, however, the board pulled from its website the September 2024 “preliminary notice” of its intent to deny the permit application, leaving no public filings in the case.
After the Iowa Capital Dispatch inquired about the missing documents, the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing uploaded a November 2024 notice to deny Wolf’s permit application, as well as the March 2025 order canceling the planned hearing.
Neither of those documents includes any mention of a patient death or the alleged role Wolf played in that case.
Other dentist sanctioned by emergency order
Wolf is the second Iowa dentist to have faced board action as a result of the Jan. 26, 2024, procedure.
Last fall, nine months after the patient died, the board issued an emergency order restricting the practice of Dr. Jonathan Karch of the Dental Studio of Iowa in Johnston. The board alleged Karch participated in the procedure and that an investigation revealed Karch “did not stay in the operatory for the duration of the procedure.”
In issuing the emergency order, the board said it “recognizes (Karch) as an imminent threat to public safety” and that he “should not be permitted to participate in procedures involving sedation until further order.” Karch’s license to practice dentistry has remained otherwise unrestricted.
The status of the disciplinary case against Karch is unknown. A hearing on the matter was scheduled for Oct. 11, 2024, but a final decision in the matter has yet to be published by the board, and there’s no published notice of the hearing being rescheduled.
Separate from the licensing board actions, a civil lawsuit has been filed against Karch, Wolf and others involved in the surgery, all of whom have denied any wrongdoing.
The lawsuit, filed in Polk County District Court by the family of Joseph Daniels, alleges that on Jan. 26, 2024, after Daniels received dental implants from Karch, patient care was turned over to a certified registered nurse anesthetist who was tasked with waking Daniels and initiating the recovery process.
The lawsuit alleges that at 3:30 p.m., a dental assistant notified Karch and Wolf they were needed in the surgical suite through a message that stated, “Joe is not doing well — please come immediately.”
According to EMS medical records, paramedics were dispatched to Dental Studio of Iowa at 3:35 p.m. with a report of an “unconscious person.” Within 25 minutes of their arrival and the administration of drugs, the paramedics had intubated Daniels, and by 4:27 they had initiated chest compressions, the lawsuit claims. Daniels was then taken to Iowa Methodist Medical Center, where he died at 5:51 p.m.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified actual and punitive damages for negligence. In their response to the lawsuit, lawyers for the defendants argue that Daniels caused his own death which they say stemmed from pre-existing conditions.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez announced Friday the state has joined 18 others in a new lawsuit against President Donald J. Trump, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, the federal Election Assistance Commission and other Trump Administration officials over Trump’s executive order regarding elections, which includes new rules requiring voters produce proof of citizenship and that all mail-in ballots be received by Election Day.
The lawsuit contends the measures in the order violate the U.S. Constitution.
“This executive order is an unconstitutional power grab that threatens the very foundation of our democracy,” Torrez said in a statement. “The President has no authority to rewrite state election laws or impose arbitrary barriers to voting. New Mexico will not stand by while the federal government oversteps its bounds and undermines the right of every eligible voter to have their voice heard. We are taking this fight to court to protect the integrity of our elections and defend the fundamental principles of our democracy.”
New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver echoed those sentiments in a statement about the executive order, calling it a “blatant overreach by the federal government into our country’s decentralized system of voting that would weaken our elections and make it harder for eligible voters to make their voices heard.”
The lawsuit specifically challenges:
• requiring state voter agencies to assess citizenship prior to “providing a federal voter registration form to enrollees of public assistance programs”
• forcing states to change their ballot-counting procedures to exclude absentee or mail-in ballots received after Election Day
• requiring military and overseas voters to provide proof of citizenship
• threatening to withhold federal funding from non-complying states
The order “interferes with States’ inherent sovereignty and their constitutional power to regulate the time, place, and manner of federal elections,” the lawsuit says. “It also usurps Congress’s powers to legislate (under the Elections Clause) and to appropriate (under the Spending Clause) because Congress has not chosen to implement the changes the President seeks to impose by decree. The critical funds at issue have in large measure already been appropriated by Congress. And if these coercive threats were not enough, the Elections EO threatens to target Plaintiff States with Department of Justice investigations and potential prosecution.”
The lawsuit goes on to say that “it bears emphasizing: the President has no power to do any of this.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Dona-Ana-County-Vote-1024x713.jpg,,,2025-04-04 15:07:57.784733
,DC,2025-04-04 19:02:34+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump administration funding freeze of $27B clean-energy program strands local projects,Allison Prang,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-funding-freeze-27b-clean-energy-program-strands-local-projects,,"WASHINGTON — A multibillion-dollar Environmental Protection Agency program designed to spur investment in energy-efficiency improvements nationwide is tied up in a legal battle that threatens to upend planned projects across the United States focused on affordable housing, the adoption of electric vehicles and more.The EPA last month said it was terminating grants tied to the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a program Congress created as part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, “based on substantial concerns regarding… program integrity, the award process, programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse, and misalignment with agency’s priorities.” President Joe Biden signed the act into law.Funds had already been dispersed into awardees’ bank accounts at Citibank as part of the program.But the Trump administration, according to a document shared related to the lawsuit, directed Citi to freeze activity on those accounts. As a result, organizations around the country either already awarded money or in advanced talks to obtain funding are unable to access capital for planned projects.The projects run the gamut, focusing on anything from installing energy-efficient technology in affordable housing units with the aim of lowering residents’ utility bills to adding solar panels to schools.“There will be … very real capacity constraints if the funding is frozen indefinitely,” said Kari Groth Swan, executive director of the Minnesota Climate Innovation Finance Authority, a state body that finances clean-energy projects.Groth Swan’s organization was awarded $25 million from the Coalition for Green Capital, one of the groups allocated funding from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.Seeding energy-efficiency projectsThe goal of the fund is to catalyze investment in energy-efficiency technology and other initiatives to reduce greenhouse gases.“We loan it out, we get it back, we do it again,” Groth Swan said. “It acts like a revolving loan fund.”The Minnesota Climate Innovation Finance Authority is one of many betting on funding from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to help get these projects off the ground. Organizations have been relying on this money to further pad much larger funding pools that include capital from outside investors.In Minnesota, for example, the $25 million the Minnesota Climate Innovation Finance Authority was awarded from the federal program makes up about one-fifth of the capital Groth Swan is planning to go toward a host of projects.They include making an old school that’s being turned into a workforce development site more energy efficient and putting solar and storage technology on schools in north Minneapolis to keep the lights on during severe weather, according to Groth Swan.Her organization also plans to loan money to an ice hockey arena for a new electric cooling system so it can stop using a toxin the EPA wants ice rinks to get rid of, she said.Suit to unfreeze fundsThe Minnesota Climate Innovation Finance Authority is one of several organizations that last month sued both the EPA and Citibank over the freezing of money from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.The fund drew ire from Republicans long before President Donald Trump’s return to the White House. Democrats, who held majorities in both chambers of Congress and the White House in 2022, passed the law creating the program without any Republicans supporting it.After Trump’s return to office, his EPA said it was terminating $20 billion in grants from the fund, and recipients sued to retain the funding.A federal judge last month ruled that Citibank couldn’t move any of the federal funding in question out of the accounts, stating that the agency hadn’t provided “credible evidence” that there was “waste, fraud, or abuse” associated with the grant agreements.When an attorney for the Department of Justice was asked in court last month whether he could provide evidence that the law had been violated through conflicts of interest or fraud, the attorney said he did not have that. The attorneys listed as representing the EPA didn’t respond to a request for comment and an EPA spokesperson said in an email that it doesn’t comment on pending litigation.The court on April 2 held a hearing over the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction, but a judge has yet to hand down a ruling.Citibank did keep the money in awardees’ accounts, said Brooke Durham, a spokesperson for Climate United, one of the funding awardees and plaintiffs in the lawsuit. But one thing Durham and others expressed concern about is the uncertainty surrounding the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund money affecting other investors in these projects.“There are a lot of people counting on these investments across the field all the way from developers to community lenders to private capital,” Durham said.Citibank declined to comment.EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, on the same day the judge issued a temporary restraining order, addressed the Greenhouse Reduction Fund in a post on the social media platform X, alleging the grants were “riddled with self-dealing and wasteful spending.”“I will not rest until these hard-earned taxpayer dollars are returned to the U.S. Treasury,” he said in the post.A letter from the EPA to the agency’s inspector general last month raised concerns with the structure of the grant awards and bank account agreements and alleged that a grant awarded to a Biden official’s former employer violated conflict-of-interest standards.

Seeking alternativesThe temporary restraining order hasn’t stopped potential funding recipients from trying to find alternative funding to keep their projects going.Megan Lasch, owner and president of Texas-based affordable housing organization firm O-SDA Industries, said her organization was going through the process to get $4 million in funding from one of the groups already given funding from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund for a $30 million affordable housing renovation in southwest Fort Worth.The project is focused on renovating 116 homes, most of which are two and three-bedroom units. Lasch’s company is aiming to lower residents’ utility bills by installing things like energy-efficient light fixtures and more efficient heating and air-conditioning systems.“It’s really important dollars that a lot of developers, real estate professionals are utilizing in their capital stack to help create and preserve affordable housing,” Lasch said.Lasch said her firm called in a favor from another nonprofit organization as a “Hail Mary” to get a loan to fill a potential void from the federal money O-SDA was counting on, but the plan is to pay the organization back. She’s not optimistic other projects will be able to move ahead without the federal funding, though, she said.“I think there’s going to be several developments that just don’t happen because there’s not another source that can get some of these deals done now,” she said.Rising costs for consumersSimilarly to Lasch, Homewise, a housing-focused developer and financial firm based in New Mexico, was also working on procuring money from different programs under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and had moved forward in the due diligence process, according to deputy CEO Johanna Gilligan.Gilligan said she hopes that either the state or philanthropic organizations could step in to help fill the funding void.Homewise’s plan is to use the money for a program to help low- to moderate-income homeowners in big cities like Albuquerque and Santa Fe reduce their utility expenses by undertaking energy-efficiency upgrades, she said.As part of that program, Homewise sends representatives out to people’s houses to help them understand where they’re losing energy and how they could lower their costs. That person might explain what tax credits or rebates people can use, Gilligan said. She described the program as “a one-stop shop for energy-efficiency improvements” and said the goal of the organization is to make these processes simpler for everyday people to understand.“That’s the real loss here,” she said. “For working-class people and those who are contributing significantly to the economy, often … this change makes it harder to help those folks to in turn be able to improve their homes and save money on their bills.”Robert Sheppard, the co-founder of Vital Housing, an affordable housing investment firm that does work in the Pacific Northwest, said his firm was awarded a 3% interest loan from one of the organizations awarded funding from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. The plan is to use the $1.5 million loan to reduce carbon emissions and energy use in an affordable housing project in Portland, Oregon, to limit residents’ utility costs.“We don’t have a source to replace the financing at this point,” said Sheppard, who has raised a total of $24 million for the project. Without the federal funding, residents would see higher energy costs, he said.“We would not do the work that is scheduled to be done, which would leave carbon exposure and maintain energy costs at a level that is above where it should be for the residents and the building,” he said.Dollars aside, some of the recipients of the federal money expressed concern that even if the funds do become available for withdrawal again, the agency’s posture toward the program could still be problematic for them.“We can win the battle of getting the funds unfrozen but we still (have) to make sure that we have a(n) EPA that understands the value of our mission and our mandate,” Minnesota’s Groth Swan said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-04-04 15:07:57.784733

Wes Moore (D) plans to issue an executive order Friday that could delay initial penalties for electric vehicle manufacturers who do not meet sales goals under a prescriptive state plan that is supposed to take effect next year.,"Gov. Wes Moore (D) takes a spin in an electric Mustang outside the Montgomery Park development in Baltimore Monday. Photo from the Executive Office of the Governor.Gov. Wes Moore (D) plans to issue an executive order Friday that could delay initial penalties for electric vehicle manufacturers who do not meet sales goals under a prescriptive state plan that is supposed to take effect next year.
The order will maximize the Maryland Department of Environment’s enforcement discretion “to ease compliance” with the rule – including the possibility of postponing penalties.
The order echoes a bill proposed this year by Del. Dana Stein (D-Baltimore County) that would prevent penalties from being assessed in model years 2027 and 2028, the sources said.
Stein’s bill is advancing in the final days of the General Assembly session. It received an initial approval from the House of Delegates Friday.
Maryland adopted a California program called Advanced Clean Cars II, which requires that electric vehicles account for 43% of cars sold in the state by a manufacturer in the 2027 model year. The number grows to  51% in model year 2028, eventually reaching 100% by the 2035 model year.
Stein has argued that the state is behind on attaining the required percentage of EVs, and expressed concern that auto manufacturers will send fewer cars to Maryland to comply with the rule.
Environmental groups have pushed back hard, arguing that manufacturers can trade credits to comply, and that penalties won’t be assessed under the rule until three years after model year 2027.
Moore’s order would also establish an oversight panel focused on the Clean Cars rule.

(Courtesy photos) Two Republican state Appeals Court judges on a three-judge panel agreed with their colleague that thousands of votes in his race for a seat on the state Supreme Court were improperly included in vote totals. 
The 2-1 ruling gives GOP Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin a boost in his effort to unseat incumbent Democratic Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs. Riggs’ 734-vote lead was reaffirmed by two recounts. In his effort to win, Griffin wants more than 60,000 votes thrown out. He sued the state Board of Elections, claiming that counting those votes is against the law. 
Republican Appeals Court Judges John Tyson and Fred Gore agreed with Griffin. They wrote that they could order those votes thrown out, but would give most voters the chance to fix deficiencies. 
They ordered the state Board of Elections to notify voters of problems. Voters will have 15 business days once the Board sends the notices to “cure” deficiencies, either by providing a partial Social Security number or driver’s license number if those numbers are missing on their voter registration forms, or by providing the copy of a photo or a photo ID exemption form if they were military or overseas absentee voters. 
Riggs said in a statement that she will appeal.

“We will be promptly appealing this deeply misinformed decision that threatens to disenfranchise more than 65,000 lawful voters and sets a dangerous precedent, allowing disappointed politicians to thwart the will of the people,” Riggs said in a statement. 
“North Carolinians elected me to keep my seat and I swore an oath to the constitution and the rule of law – so I will continue to stand up for the rights of voters in this state and stand in the way of those who would take power from the people.”
The next step will likely be an appeal to the seven-member state Supreme Court, where Republicans hold a 5-2 majority. Riggs has recused herself, and three of the Republican justices have already indicated support for Griffin’s arguments. 
The state Republican Party said in a statement that the Court of Appeals vindicated Griffin’s election integrity protests.
“The decision and the order finally holds the NC State Board of Elections accountable for their actions and confirms every legal vote will be counted in this contest,” the NC GOP statement says. 
“For months, Judge Griffin and the NCGOP have endured baseless and incendiary rhetoric in this matter. Throughout this time, our position has been consistent, when the debate is about the merits, Judge Griffin will prevail in his election integrity concerns.”
State Democratic Party chair Anderson Clayton issued a statement blasting the opinion.
“Today, Republican judges Tyson and Gore put party affiliation above the rights of North Carolina voters. In an unsigned, partisan decision, they legitimized Jefferson Griffin’s unconstitutional challenge to more than 66,000 voters, and held that those voters should be forced to comply with requirements that did not exist at the time of the election. Republicans are trying to change the rules because they lost the game,” said Clayton.
A lengthy dissent
The Democrat on the three-member panel, Judge Tobias Hampson, supported the election board’s decisions.
In a 66-page dissent, Hampson wrote that voters followed the rules they were given and had every expectation that their votes would count. 
“Changing the rules by which these lawful voters took part in our electoral process after the election to discard their otherwise valid votes in an attempt to alter the outcome of only one race among many on the ballot is directly counter to law, equity, and the Constitution,” Hampson wrote. 
Griffin is challenging three sets of ballots. He claims that more than 60,000 voters were not properly registered because they did not include either a partial Social Security number or driver’s license number on their forms. Voters Griffin is challenging have come forward in the past months to say they did provide that information, but it was excluded from the electronic voter file due to typos or data mismatches.
The court’s majority opinion said the state and county elections boards should have told voters that those numbers were missing. 
“The Board and county boards failed in their duty to contact existing improperly registered voters whose electronic records omitted or did not show a driver’s license number or social security number to cure the information deficiency,” they wrote. Voters in this category will have 15 days once the election board notices go out to provide the information. 
Military and overseas voters
Griffin is also challenging the votes of more than 5,500 military and overseas absentee voters because they did not provide voter ID with their ballots. These voters are from a handful of overwhelmingly Democratic counties. The state Board of Elections does not require military and overseas voters to submit a copy of their photo ID. Griffin’s lawyers say the elections board is wrong to exempt those absentee voters from the photo ID requirement. A lawyer for Riggs said during the Appeals Court hearing last month that no other state requires military and overseas absentee voters to provide ID, and the portals that most of those voters use don’t have a way to submit them. These voters will also have 15 days to provide a copy of an ID or a photo ID exemption form. 
Lastly, Griffin is challenging a few hundred ballots from overseas absentee voters who have never lived in North Carolina, but who are connected to the state through their parents. The majority Appeals Court opinion said that these votes should be removed from the count because these voters do not have the right to vote in non-federal elections.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Riggs-Griffin-900.jpg,,,2025-04-04 15:07:57.784733

Maine families are wrestling with a dire lack of child care options, particularly in more rural parts of the state. 
Rep. Holly Eaton (D-Deer Isle) has proposed a pilot project that would offer tuition grants for rural Mainers interested in getting into child care or an early childhood profession to complete their education, and additional funds to open their own facility.
That proposal, LD 1280, was one of the five bills aimed at better serving Maine children and families discussed before the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee on Friday. 
The two-part pilot project would require a one time appropriation of $600,000 and would target individuals who are not eligible for the state’s free community college program. 
Eaton said operating the programs as a pilot would give the state a chance to collect data and explore scalable solutions to address the child care shortage that affects the entire state but is particularly acute in rural Maine. 
According to the Maine Center for Economic Policy, an estimated 18,000 people in Maine are currently out of the labor force due to a lack of child care. 
Part of the challenge is that providers are struggling to stay afloat as they are often caught between wanting to keep costs down for families while paying their staff sufficient wages.
One proposal meant to support child care centers came from Sen. Joe Baldacci (D-Penobscot). LD 1191 seeks to ensure that child care providers who accept children in the state’s foster care system receive timely reimbursement from the Department of Health and Human Services. 
His bill would require the department to pay invoices from a child care provider within 15 days of receipt, as well as offer guidance to providers to ensure they are filing invoices correctly to receive prompt payment. There are also annual reporting requirements about the timeliness of these payments. 
This bill comes after recent reports of untimely payments, though Bobbi Johnson, director of the Office of Child and Family Services, said the vast majority of disbursements are being made on time. She spoke with the Health and Human Services Committee just last month about this issue and the reasons her agency has identified behind such delays.
Currently, there is an average of five days between the time invoices are entered into the agency’s system and they are paid, Johnson said Friday. She added that 99% of all payments are already being paid within that 15-day window outlined in the bill. 
Betsey Grant, who owns Tiny Tikes Daycare in Trenton and has served nearly 60 foster children in the past few years, said timely reimbursement is important, but argued it’s even more important for providers to be paid in advance, which is common practice for families not involved in the child welfare system.
Investing in prevention 
The committee also heard testimony on two bills that would bolster support for parents and help prevent child abuse. 
Meyer sponsored LD 1060, which would provide $100,000 in one time funding for the Be There for ME campaign, which launched last year to help reduce the stigma associated with parents asking for help. 
The campaign also includes a website that provides resources in a dozen different languages for housing or behavioral health services, as well as offers peer support from other parents in Maine. 
She also introduced LD 1061, which would provide $1.5 million in ongoing annual funding for the statewide network of abuse prevention councils under the Maine Children’s Trust. The councils work in all 16 of Maine’s counties building community resources and offering important training for parents but, according to Executive Director Heidi Aakjer, funding for the trust hasn’t increased in more than 15 years.
While no one testified against either bill, multiple parents and individuals involved with the abuse prevention councils spoke in support, describing them as valuable resources for families in Maine. They told the committee that investing in the prevention of abuse could not only strengthen and preserve families, but prevent the higher costs of a child entering state custody. 
Reunification
A final bill discussed before the committee Friday was LD 1108, introduced by Rep. Abigail Griffin (R-Levant) to strengthen the reunification process for children in state custody in cases where the parents struggle with substance use disorder. 
The legislation would implement random drug screening for those parents, as well as ensure that certain reunification meetings are scheduled at times that work for the parents. However, Johnson said these are already standard practices for the child welfare agency when substance use is a factor in removing the child. 
The proposal would also prohibit the state from petitioning a court to return custody to the parent sooner than six months after the child was removed from the home. Johnson raised constitutional concerns with this, explaining that there is an established judicial process and cautioned that each case comes with unique circumstances.

(Helaina Thompson/Courtesy of Over the Moon Farm)Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.

The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.

The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
A mixed response from states
The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment. 










A lot of these farmers, they're living their dreams.

“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
Creating a new food system
In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.

Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

According to the poll, conducted in early March by YouGov, 88% of respondents said they would support legislation to allow residential homes to be built in commercial zones; 76% would support laws requiring cities and towns to allow homes to be built on smaller lot sizes; and 76% would support allowing property owners to build detached accessory dwelling units by right.
The poll found that 55% of respondents considered New Hampshire’s housing shortage and high prices to be the number one issue facing Granite Staters, surpassing inflation, taxes, homelessness, health care costs, and immigration. And 80% said the cost of housing is “a problem” in the state.
“The message is clear: New Hampshire is experiencing a severe housing shortage that is being felt from southern New Hampshire to the North Country and all across the state,” Nick Taylor, director of Housing Action NH, said in a statement.
The poll was released as lawmakers are considering a number of bills aimed at increasing housing development by requiring cities and towns to change zoning policies seen as barriers to construction.
One bill, House Bill 577, would allow the construction of detached accessory units — additional units that are not directly attached to the primary resident — by right, stopping cities and towns from passing zoning ordinances that automatically exclude them. Another, House Bill 382, would restrict the minimum number of parking spaces a municipality could require of housing developments to one space per unit, in an attempt to block what some developers say are unnecessary burdens.
Senate Bill 284 would also limit the minimum number parking spaces in town zoning codes, while Senate Bill 84 would block cities and towns from setting minimum lot sizes of more than one acre for residential homes serviced by sewer and water lines — for at least 50% of residential zoned land. And House Bill 631 would allow property owners in commercial zones to build residential units, while allowing cities and towns to impose some restrictions. 
HB 577, HB 382, and HB 631 have passed the House and are currently being considered in the Senate Commerce Committee. SB 284 and SB 84 have passed the Senate and are being taken up in the House Housing Committee. 
The bills have the support of affordable housing advocates and industry groups in construction, such as the New Hampshire Homebuilders Association and Housing Action New Hampshire. But they have drawn criticism from the New Hampshire Municipal Association, which represents cities and towns, and another conservative group, the Coalition of New Hampshire Taxpayers. Opponents say the bills improperly insert the state into local zoning code decisions, and that municipalities should be allowed to decide how best to change their codes to expand housing. 
Gov. Kelly Ayotte has vowed to help combat the housing crisis in part by directing state agencies such as the Department of Environmental Services and the Fish and Game Department to speed up their permitting processes, promising to guarantee the state permitting process takes no more than 60 days for developers. 
But the House Finance Committee’s recommended version of the state’s two budget bills, House Bill 1 and House Bill 2, makes a number of cuts to agencies and programs designed to help expand housing. The budget eliminates the state’s housing appeals board, a recently created entity designed to speed up developers’ appeals of adverse zoning and planning board rulings, and it defunds the Housing Champion Designation and Grant Program, which gives towns and cities grants and special benefits if they voluntarily overhaul their zoning to encourage more housing.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/housingconstruct-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-04 15:07:57.784733

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A federal prosecutor says in court filings that the former leader of a Kansas foster care agency should not be allowed to attend his daughter’s high school graduation in El Salvador because he is a flight risk.
Robert “Father Bobby” Smith, the former Saint Francis Ministries CEO who is charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, 15 counts of wire fraud, and one count of money laundering, asked the court last month to visit his ex-wife and daughter in June in El Salvador. Court filings also show he has entered into plea negotiations.
Smith was required to surrender his passport as a condition of his pretrial release. Skip Jacobs, an assistant U.S. attorney in Topeka, said Friday in a court filing that the passport condition is “not flexible.”
“Given the defendant’s charges, potential sentencing outcomes, connections and family ties to El Salvador, and severe limitations available to the government to extradite defendant from El Salvador should he flee, the government submits the prohibition of defendant maintaining or possessing a passport cannot be removed without creating significant risk of flight,” Jacobs wrote.
A federal grand jury indicted Smith in 2022 following an investigation into alleged financial misconduct. Federal authorities have accused Smith and a co-defendant of conspiring to defraud the foster care agency through fraudulent billing of IT services, and accused Smith of fraudulently using company credit cards to pay for personal expenses. He faces up to 20 years in prison for the conspiracy and wire fraud charges, and up to 10 years for the money laundering charge.
As CEO of Saint Francis, Smith hired his wife, Angela, as vice president and director of international ministries. In that role, she purchased and developed a 55-acre farm in El Salvador with the stated purpose of producing the “moringa” fruit as a new revenue stream for Saint Francis. Smith approved more than $2 million in spending to support her efforts, but the farm never turned a profit, according to court filings.
An internal investigation following Smith’s departure from Saint Francis found that a project manager in El Salvador had asked for and received a credit card so he could use cash advances to bribe government officials. However, the cards were used almost entirely for small purchases of fast food and lodging.
Former Saint Francis accountant Jamie Palenski said she could not identify the purpose of Angela Smith’s numerous trips to El Salvador, and social media posts identify Angela Smith being on the beach while supposedly on business, Jacobs wrote.
Angela Smith has traveled to El Salvador about 20 times in the past three years, Jacobs wrote, apparently spending enough time there to enroll her daughter in a school.
Robert Smith, who now lives in Johnson City, Tennessee, asked the court to fly on June 13 into El Salvador. He would attend his daughter’s high school graduation at Colegio Internacional de San Salvador and would stay at an Airbnb near the apartment where his ex-wife lives with their three other daughters in San Benito. After graduation, the family would travel to the beach community of Los Cobanos. He would re-surrender his passport upon return June 17.
Jacobs said a treaty between the U.S. and El Salvador allows the U.S. to request extradition if Robert Smith were arrested under El Salvador laws. However, there is no agreement that would require El Salvadorian law enforcement to aid in his apprehension.
“In other words, the United States cannot task El Salvador to go and arrest the defendant for the purpose of extradition,” Jacobs wrote. “As such, were defendant to flee to El Salvador, there is little the United States could do legally to ensure his return to the United States.”
“The risk of flight if defendant is allowed to travel to El Salvador is too great,” Jacobs added.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SFM1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-04 15:07:57.784733

Tim Walz, and other elected officials hold a press conference to mark the first annual state Juneteenth holiday. Photo by Senate Media Services.On March 24, Minnesota Senate President Bobby Joe Champion, DFL-Minneapolis, introduced a bill (SF2978) providing a $1 million grant to 21 Days of Peace, a violence prevention group headed by the Rev. Jerry McAfee.
Sitting next to McAfee at a Jobs and Economic Development hearing on April 2, Champion praised the pastor’s group as an organization “dedicated to reducing violence and supporting individuals re-entering the workforce and providing holistic, culturally responsive services to at-risk youth and adults.”
What neither Champion nor McAfee mentioned during the hearing: Starting in 2022, Champion, in his private capacity as an attorney, represented McAfee and his nonprofit Salem Inc. in four court cases involving nonpayment of mortgages on multiple Minneapolis properties, totaling roughly half a million dollars.
That period overlaps with the 2023-24 legislative session, when lawmakers gave a $3 million grant to McAfee’s nonprofit. 
Champion was the chief author of that bill as well. 
Champion says that his work on the mortgage cases was pro-bono, and that because it concluded in December 2022, prior to the start of the legislative session, he did not need to disclose the relationship to the public or to his colleagues. 
“There would be no need to disclose a work relationship which had already concluded at that time, and which provides no financial benefit to me,” he said through a spokesperson.
But at least two of the cases did not have final judgments issued until March or April of 2023, after Champion had introduced the funding bill and lawmakers held a hearing on it.
McAfee, in an interview with the Reformer, refused to say whether he paid Champion for his legal services: “I won’t answer that,” he said. “Is there something on the books that would prevent me from hiring him as an attorney?”
Champion says he keeps records of his pro-bono clients, but declined to share the relevant portions.
Richard Painter, a University of Minnesota Law School professor who was the chief White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush, said Champion’s actions represent a “clear” conflict of interest.
“Nobody should sponsor a bill in the Legislature favoring a client, pro-bono or not, it doesn’t matter,” he said. “It’s a basic principle that in a legislative body, if there is a bill that’s going to help your client, you say, ‘This is my client.’”
In December 2023, after Champion successfully spearheaded the effort to steer $3 million to McAfee’ nonprofit, McAfee and his wife each donated $1,000 to Champion’s campaign committee, the maximum allowed under state law.
Legal troubles

In the spring and early summer of 2022, McAfee and his nonprofit Salem Inc. were sued by multiple creditors alleging mortgage nonpayment on four Minneapolis properties, totaling nearly half a million dollars. 
McAfee says the mortgage issues stemmed from his work helping people in his community obtain housing.
“One of the things I do is I put people in homes,” he said. “I certainly don’t make the best business decisions. But if I have to sacrifice myself to get people in houses, I’d do it all over again.”
Champion represented McAfee and Salem on the cases. In September 2022, all parties agreed to have the disputes mediated by a third-party law firm.
Champion says his work on the cases concluded in December 2022, before the start of the legislative session.
But final notices of dismissal of the cases weren’t issued until February 6, 2023. Final judgments were filed between February 8 and April 18. 
Champion introduced the bill steering $3 million to McAfee’s organization on March 16, and presented it to the Jobs and Economic Development Committee on March 20.
At that hearing, Champion spoke in glowing terms about the work McAfee’s organization was doing. He did not mention his work representing McAfee in court. In response to a question from Sen. Rich Draheim, R-Madison Lake, Champion said that the Senate bill had a companion in the House.
But no companion bill is listed on the Office of the Revisor’s website. The funding was nevertheless included in the final jobs bill that passed that year.
Another request for funding
Champion is listed as the attorney for McAfee and Salem Inc. on three additional cases filed in May 2023 involving some of the same properties. Several of those cases show filings through 2024 and 2025. But Champion says he never worked on them, and that he’s listed due to an error by the plaintiff’s attorney, who assumed he was still representing McAfee.
“When a separate matter was filed in 2023, the plaintiffs attorney initially listed me as defense counsel on the presumption I was still active in that role,” Champion said. “However, I communicated to that attorney that I was not working for the defense, and did no work on the subsequent case.”
In recent months, the city of Minneapolis pulled a violence prevention contract issued to McAfee’s nonprofit after City Council members alleged he threatened them and made homophobic remarks, and two of McAfee’s violence interrupters were charged over their involvement in a north Minneapolis shooting.
McAfee has maintained the violence interrupters were acting in self-defense.
Those recent controversies were enough to prompt Republican lawmakers to ask pointed questions at this month’s hearing for the additional $1 million in funding for McAfee’s group. Champion defended McAfee’s actions toward the Minneapolis City Council. 
He did not mention his previous legal work on McAfee’s behalf.
A group of legislators from both parties recently urged their colleagues to end the practice of steering grants to favored nonprofit groups, citing a lack of oversight and accountability.
In 2014, Republicans in the Senate filed an ethics complaint against Champion, in part over his work as an attorney representing a community member who founded a nonprofit that received grant funding from the Minneapolis School District. They alleged that Champion threatened to withhold state aid from the school district if it did not award the grant to his client’s organization.
The Senate Subcommittee on Ethical Conduct deadlocked over whether or not to pursue those allegations.

In fact, it would add more to the deficit than all four of these major laws combined.”That deficit impact, CRFB wrote, “would be the equivalent of adding a large new welfare program to the federal deficit.”No Democratic votes neededRepublicans in Congress must adopt a budget resolution in order to use the complex reconciliation process to pass many of their core campaign promises.The special legislative pathway will let the GOP enact changes without needing the support of Democrats to get past the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster.The largest deficit increase within the package would come from extending the 2017 GOP tax law, about $4.5 trillion in deficits, and likely making other changes to the U.S. tax code, about $1.5 trillion.House Republicans want to try to offset some of that $6 trillion total in new deficits by cutting about $1.5 trillion in federal spending, though exactly how they’d do that remains under discussion.Centrist Republicans in Congress have raised concerns about the House’s instructions calling on the Energy and Commerce Committee to find at least $880 billion in spending cuts.That panel oversees Medicare and Medicaid and couldn’t reach that level of spending cuts without making some substantial changes to one or both of the programs.GOP leaders and President Donald Trump have repeatedly said they won’t touch Medicare, leaving Medicaid, the state-federal program for lower-income people, as the likely source of the funding cuts.Senate GOP approachSenate Republicans wrote themselves a much lower threshold for cutting government spending in the budget resolution —  a $4 billion minimum from four different committees across the 10-year budget window.The Senate instructions, CRFB wrote in its analysis, “would allow a reconciliation bill that is nearly as large as the largest federal spending programs.“A bill adding $5.8 trillion to deficits would be more than three-quarters (77 percent) as large as all projected Medicaid spending. It would equal 69 percent of base defense spending over the same time period, including being three times as large as projected spending dedicated to the Army. It would even equal half of all net spending on Medicare and a third of all spending on Social Security.”CRFB wrote that Congress should change its course now.“Instead of passing a bill with an historically large deficit impact, lawmakers should use this opportunity to rein in borrowing with a fiscally responsible package that can set the stage for a permanent package of thoughtful tax extensions and budget savings that grows the economy and improves our debt outlook.”The Senate is expected to vote sometime this weekend to approve the compromise budget resolution and send it back to the House for final approval.Once both chambers vote to adopt it, they can formally begin writing, debating, amending and voting to approve the reconciliation package.",,,,2025-04-04 15:07:57.784733

(Courtesy of Van DeWald/National Weather Service via NWS Omaha Facebook page)LINCOLN —  Some in Nebraska’s federal delegation are seeking answers about recent cuts steered by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency to the national agency responsible for monitoring local weather.
Last month, the Trump administration cut 1,000 jobs at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, which includes the National Weather Service. Those cuts reached home when the Weather Service office for the Omaha area and other Great Plains offices recently announced pausing the deployment of weather balloons after the department cuts. 
Weather balloons are a key tool in forecasting; Midwestern meteorologists say the data loss will likely lead to forecasting challenges in a region known for volatile, unpredictable weather as much of the area prepares for tornadoes and severe storms.
U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., sent a letter to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to express his concern about the plan to lay off personnel at the NOAA following the recent wave of deadly storms across the country.
“NOAA plays a significant role in the protection of Nebraskans from dangerous weather events – especially tornadoes, blizzards, and flooding,” Bacon’s letter reads. 
Nebraska experienced a blizzard last month, which caused Gov. Jim Pillen to declare a state of emergency for 24 counties. The damage estimates from the blizzard continue to climb, now at $53 million.
Last month, Bacon said he would “press the White House” to restore the Weather Service office’s ability to deploy weather balloons. U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., went to the Omaha office to discuss the recent cuts with meteorologists. 
The Omaha office’s head meteorologist said the office has been about half-staffed for more than a year during a press conference late last month. Officials said the Omaha office opted to suspend weather balloon launches to focus on real-time analysis and tracking potential severe weather.
NOAA already laid off several hundred employees before the latest cuts by the Trump Administration. NWS also reduced launches to once a day at six other offices. Current NOAA staff aren’t authorized to speak with the media about the suspension of weather balloon flights. 
When the Examiner contacted the Valley office, a spokesperson said it is “dedicated to providing watches, warnings, advisories and other weather information for the protection of life and property” and directed questions about cuts to the national office.

The national public affairs office did not respond to a request to comment about the Omaha-area weather station cuts. The rest of Nebraska’s all-GOP delegation expressed concerns about grounding the weather balloons. 
U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., said her office will be “monitoring the situation.” U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb., told the Examiner he is “seeking information from the weather service to ensure Nebraskans continue to have access to timely, accurate weather notifications.”
Eric Hunt, an agricultural meteorologist with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, told Nebraska Public Media that the “worst-case scenario” involves forecasting accuracy returning to its 2000s levels because it would lead to shorter warning times for potential severe weather and less accurate long-term forecasts.
Flood said he plans to meet with the agency soon and look into Congress’s option to restore “this vital service.”

Josh Stein to halt Duke Energy’s fossil fuel expansion and what they called the “suppression of renewable energy solutions” with his executive authority, according to a press release.
Four public health and climate scientists, along with the Center for Biological Diversity and solar nonprofit advocacy group NC WARN, organized the letter. It’s signed by a total of 61 scientists from universities and agencies across the country, some of which are at Duke University or the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill.
The letter asks Stein to prevent Duke Energy, what the letter authors termed “the third-largest corporate climate polluter in the United States,” from delaying transitions from fossil fuels to renewable energy.
The town of Carrboro, N.C. sued Duke Energy at the end of last year, alleging the company’s top executives have misled the public about climate science and its harms for decades.
“Duke Energy executives are brushing aside scientists’ warnings and Gov. Stein needs to step in for the sake of people and our planet,” Drew Shindell, Ph.D., a climate scientist at Duke University and lead author on two U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports, said in a statement. “The science is clear that as long as we keep burning fossil fuels, climate disasters like Helene and extreme heat waves will keep getting worse. These disasters will cost lives, drive species extinct and obliterate many of the places we call home. This is urgent and Gov. Stein has a responsibility to use all the tools at his disposal to force mega-polluters like Duke Energy to do what’s best for North Carolinians.”
The company possesses one of the biggest planned gas buildouts of any utility for the decade. Duke Energy recently announced its intent to consider delaying retiring its coal fleet as a result of the Trump administration’s climate protection rollbacks.
Historically, Duke Energy has not invested into local renewable energy solutions, like rooftop and community solar, according to the press release. The company generates only 1.4% of its power from solar energy.
“Duke Energy’s reckless expansion of fossil gas is costing lives and saddling North Carolinians with skyrocketing utility bills and deadlier extreme weather. Trump and his billionaire buddies are throwing communities and our climate under the bus, so we desperately need Gov. Stein to step up and challenge the polluters putting our planet in peril,” Gaby Sarri-Tobar, senior energy justice campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement.
In response, a spokesperson for Duke Energy declined to address the scientists’ contention directly. “We are committed to our customers and communities and will continue working with policymakers, regulators and other state leaders to deliver reliable and increasingly clean energy while keeping rates as low as possible,” Duke Energy lead communications manager Garrett Poorman told NC Newsline.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roxboro-aerial-SELC-1024x634.webp,,,2025-04-04 15:07:57.784733

That changed with the second term of President Donald Trump and the rise of the Department of Government Efficiency and Elon Musk.
Now she’s an organizer of a Grand Forks chapter of a national group behind protests of the Trump administration on Saturday. 
“I’ve never been terrified before,” she said.

Ed Schafer, a former Cabinet secretary and North Dakota Republican governor, said he believes people want the smaller federal government Musk and Trump are trying to create. But he said he knows many people don’t agree with the means to that end. 
“To be successful, you have to build public trust, and I don’t see that,” Schafer said. “You have to do it in a manner that is sustainable.” 
The fear that Williams and others are feeling has led to Hands Off!, a national day of action on Saturday. In North Dakota, some of the events are organized by a group called Indivisible. 
“This mass mobilization day is our message to the world that we do not consent to the destruction of our government and our economy for the benefit of Trump and his billionaire allies,” a description of the Fargo-area event planned for Saturday says. 
Other groups, including 50501, also are participating in events Saturday. Protests also are planned Saturday in Grand Forks, Bismarck, Jamestown and Minot. An event in Valley City was scheduled for Friday.

Rick Loftus, a doctor at the Veterans Administration hospital in Fargo, is the organizer of the Indivisible Fargo chapter, also known as Fearless. 
“Indivisible wants to focus on connecting citizens with their elected officials, holding electeds accountable to the people they represent,” Loftus said. 
He said the group is nonviolent and nonpartisan, with the Fargo chapter including Democrats, Republicans and independents, meeting every other Sunday.
“Everyone is respected. Everyone is welcome,” Loftus said. “We are explicitly pro-democracy, anti-fascism.” 
There is a partner chapter on the Minnesota side of the Red River — Red River United, that also is taking part in Saturday’s event. 




 North Dakota Hands Off! events Saturday

Fargo: 4 to 6 p.m., starting on the Veterans Memorial Bridge over the Red River on Main Avenue and moving to Woodlawn Park in Moorhead at about 5 p.m.
Grand Forks: 2:30 p.m. in the Town Square on DeMers Avenue, downtown.
Bismarck: 4 to 6 p.m. on the state Capitol grounds
Minot: 4 to 5 p.m., City Hall
Jamestown: Noon, Mill Hill




The Grand Forks area group formed in March, which as of Monday had more than 100 members, Williams said. That membership includes East Grand Forks, Minnesota, and other towns in northeast North Dakota, such as Grafton and Mayville. 
Williams said she is worried about the treatment of federal judges, how her former education colleagues from other countries may be treated and about cuts to the Social Security Administration by the Department of Government Efficiency. 
“If Elon Musk destroys the department, it’s not going to be able to issue checks with any kind of efficiency,” she said. 
Schafer, who was secretary of agriculture under President George W. Bush, said he is very familiar with how difficult it is to change the entrenched bureaucracy in Washington.  
“It needs to be done,” Schafer said.
He said Trump “just breaking down the doors” was perhaps the only way to get it started. 
Schafer said his experience is that the people in government best positioned to save money are those who work on the front lines of the programs. 
“Unless you can encourage or enlist the people who are out in the street delivering the programs, you’re not going to find a sustainable situation,” Schafer said. 
Nearly 67% of North Dakota voters supported Trump in the 2024 election, his strongest showing in the state in his three presidential campaigns. A North Dakota News Cooperative poll released in March showed a 52% approval rating for Trump’s policies. 
Sandi Sanford, chair of the North Dakota Republican Party, said in a statement that Trump is delivering on his campaign promises, “from securing our borders to revitalizing the economy.”
“As new policies take shape under his administration, we are confident that North Dakota — and
America — will continue to prosper,” Sanford said. 
House Bill 1442 in the Republican-dominated North Dakota Legislature seeks to create a state version of DOGE. 
While DOGE is trying to make federal employees accountable, Indivisible seeks to do the same with elected officials. 
Loftus said the Indivisible group promotes reaching out to elected officials through phone calls, letters and meetings with the official or their staff. 
“Sometimes holding a protest outside an office if they’re not willing to meet with us,” Loftus said. “It’s about getting messages to the elected about what people care about.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)  A federal judge chose not to stop the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) from examining how or if it will institute President Donald Trump’s January executive order forbidding federal subsidizing of “gender ideology” when it comes to awarding grants. 
But Senior District Judge William E. Smith agreed with the arts organizations suing the federal government on several points, including that the NEA will likely violate the First Amendment if it goes through with broad, ideological restrictions on the projects it funds. Still he said it was too early to intervene as the agency plans to announce how or if it will follow the order on April 30.
“This is the rare case where the balance of the harms and equities plus the public interest caution against the extraordinary relief requested,” Smith wrote in his 47-page decision released Thursday night.
The four groups that brought suit — Rhode Island Latino Arts, The Theater Offensive, National Queer Theater, and Theatre Communications Group — all intended to apply for grants for LGBTQ+ projects. The plaintiffs were represented by the national American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the ACLU of Rhode Island in the case filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island.
“The opinion makes clear that the NEA cannot lawfully reimpose its viewpoint-based eligibility bar,” Vera Eidelman, an ACLU senior staff attorney, said in a statement Thursday. “Though it falls short of the relief we were seeking, we are hopeful that artists of all views and backgrounds will remain eligible for the support and recognition they deserve.”
The plaintiffs sought to stop the NEA from applying Executive Order 14168 to its grantmaking procedures. In early March, the NEA had initially implemented the order by requiring grant applicants to check a box confirming that their work did not promote gender ideology — an impossibility, the plaintiffs argued, given their organizations’ showcasing of LGBTQ+ narratives and performers. There was also the possibility that LGBTQ+ content might fail to meet eligibility criteria under the new laws and be barred categorically.
But the NEA quickly removed the allegiance checkbox, and by March 17 had issued a memo stating it would cease rollout of the order for the time being. It also extended the application deadline for the current grant cycle. The agency expects to complete its internal review of the order by April 16 ahead of its public April 30 announcement.
That doesn’t help plaintiffs, who needed to apply for the grant cycle’s new deadline of Monday, April 7, to keep their production timelines intact.
“The court’s decision will leave our clients in a state of censorial limbo,” Steven Brown, executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island, said in a statement Thursday. 
Judge notes separation-of-powers concerns
Emilya Cachapero, co-executive director of national and global programming at Theatre Communications Group, was “disappointed” by the decision, she said in a statement, and pointed to wider implications: “This moment is about more than a single grant cycle — it’s about the future of artistic freedom in this country.”
According to court documents, Rhode Island Latino Arts and Theatre Communications Group testified that they were considering axing LGBTQ+ themes from upcoming productions to better secure grant funding — effectively self-censoring to avoid the executive order’s mandates. 
“We shouldn’t need to negotiate for the right to support and uplift all artists — including transgender and nonbinary artists,” Marta V. Martinez, executive director of Rhode Island Latino Arts, said in a statement. “This order fails to bring us the clarity we need to apply for funds for projects that allow Latinx artists, especially those who are queer, trans, or nonbinary, to show up as their whole selves without fear of erasure or censorship.”
In his ruling, Smith wrote that maneuvering to stop the NEA during its administrative process meant that granting relief would be premature — and it would not soothe much for the plaintiffs, as they no longer “faced a potential harm of civil, criminal, or administrative penalties for making false statements” since the compliance pledge has been removed from the application.

“If the Court enjoins the NEA from imposing an eligibility bar at this juncture, it will in effect short circuit the ongoing administrative review process set to conclude in a matter of days,” Smith wrote. 
That would not be ideal, the judge thought, as it “would rob the NEA of the opportunity to make its own considered decision.” The agency may conclude that the executive order is incompatible with the statute that authorizes its existence and duties, and may need congressional approval to take effect within the NEA.
“For the Court to intercede and mandate this outcome would raise obvious separation-of-powers concerns,” Smith wrote.
“Once the NEA completes its process, Plaintiffs may well return to the Court for relief — or, if the NEA declines to adopt the EO in any way, they may drop the curtain on this action altogether,” the judge concluded in his ruling.
Plaintiff Giselle Byrd, executive director of The Theater Offensive, said in a statement she was ready to wait for the NEA’s decision — and return to court if necessary: “Time is our greatest ally. … If this executive order is reimposed, we will be back in court and fighting against the unlawful attack on the First Amendment. We do not walk away silently against injustice and silence will not protect us.”
Not vague, but all too clear
Smith’s refusal of the plaintiffs’ request was not exactly a siding with the federal defendants — something his thorough decision makes clear, with arguments from the March 27 motion hearing explored in detail by the judge.   
The attorneys had sparred over whether NEA-funded projects constitute private speech — which is guarded by the First Amendment — or government speech, which lacks such protections. Smith conceded that the law is dense and nuanced in cases that define what speech is or isn’t. But he agreed with the ACLU that the NEA subsidizes private works, and is not a vehicle for official sentiments.
LGBTQ+ theater groups have day in court over endangered arts funding

“It seems clear that the NEA’s grantmaking process was designed to facilitate private speech, and not to promote a governmental message,” he wrote. “NEA-funded art is therefore protected under the First Amendment; and where, as here, the government has imposed a viewpoint-based condition on the receipt of those funds, there is a clear First Amendment violation.”
But Smith did agree with the U.S. Department of Justice’s argument that NEA grants are competitive.
​​“Plaintiffs must make choices that hopeful grant applicants make all the time about what to propose in their application, to enhance their chances of success. The Court cannot make the process free of difficult choices,” Smith wrote.
The NEA also eschewed the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Smith agreed with the ACLU, when they initially adopted the executive order and created extra eligibility requirements for applicants. But he disagreed that the NEA was “arbitrary and capricious” in its carrying out of the order, as the ACLU had argued. 
The eligibility bar, Smith argued, is not problematic because of vagueness — it is problematic because it actively encourages the NEA to discriminate against certain kinds of applicants.
“If anything, the eligibility bar severely narrows the discretion of NEA personnel in deciding which projects to approve, and that is precisely why it likely violates both the APA and the First Amendment,” Smith wrote.

The Nurse Loan Repayment Program will provide up to $300,000 in tax-free funds to successful applicants to repay student debt for up to four years for those working at state psychiatric facilities or up to 10 years for individuals working at other eligible sites. There is about $9 million in funding available. 
Applicants will compete for two-year agreements from the program, and are  required to work a minimum of 40 hours per week for no less than 45 weeks per year at eligible nonprofit practice sites that provide nursing services. Full-time for nurses in public school settings or who teach at a school of nursing are also eligible.
“Nurses are the backbone of the health care system, providing essential care to patients in hospitals, clinics, schools and homes,” DHHS director Elizabeth Hertel said in a statement. “They are often the first point of contact for patients and play a critical role in patient education, advocacy and support. Health care facilities across the state are facing nursing shortages and this loan repayment program will help providers recruit and retain nurses to provide vital care to patients.”
According to the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration 74 of Michigan’s 83 counties are experiencing a shortage of primary care providers in at least part of the county. 
Nurses applying for the program must hold an active license as either a registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse. 



Nurses looking to apply to the program must also:

Hold U.S. citizenship.
Be committed to providing nursing services in an underserved community, priority site or teaching at a Michigan School of Nursing.
Have an agreement of employment at a non-profit practice site, with a start date no later than Oct. 1 following the current application period, before applying for the loan repayment program.
Confirm their employers will support their agreements since employers are required to continue employing the applicant during their two-year agreement.
Remain with their current employer throughout their two-year loan repayment agreement.
Learn and comply with the program’s requirements. 




Employers may not use payments from the Nurse Loan Repayment Program to offset participating employees’ salaries or other aspects of their compensation packages.
Applications and further information are available at Michigan.gov/NLRP. The deadline is Wednesday, June 4.

Underly at a rally in February. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction is reviewing a request by the Trump administration that state education agencies ensure they aren’t using diversity, equity and inclusion programs — or risk losing federal funding. 
According to WisPolitics, state Superintendent Jill Underly said the agency is looking at the U.S. Department of Education’s “justification and authority to request sign off from Wisconsin schools on the federal agency’s political beliefs.” 
“Now more than ever, Wisconsin’s students, educators and schools need support – not threats of federal funding cuts that are vital to their success,” Underly said in a statement. “As we stated in February, we remain confident Wisconsin schools and the DPI are in full compliance with the law and remain committed to providing the best education possible for our students.”
In a letter, the Department of Education said that state agencies need to certify their compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and the responsibilities outlined in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard — the landmark Supreme Court decision that said race-based programs in higher education violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and effectively ended consideration of race in admissions programs. 
“Federal financial assistance is a privilege, not a right,” Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor said in a statement. “When state education commissioners accept federal funds, they agree to abide by federal antidiscrimination requirements. Unfortunately, we have seen too many schools flout or outright violate these obligations, including by using DEI programs to discriminate against one group of Americans to favor another based on identity characteristics in clear violation of Title VI.” 
The request comes as a part of President Donald Trump’s ongoing attack on DEI efforts across the country.
State agencies were given 10 days to collect certification from local education agencies and respond, according to the release. 
Underly, who was reelected to a second term this week, also urged state lawmakers Wednesday to invest in Wisconsin’s public schools amid the threat of funding cuts by the federal government.
“An unprecedented number of our school districts have been forced to turn to referenda, asking their communities to raise property taxes just to compensate for the state’s underfunding. On top of that, the Trump administration’s reckless cuts threaten the critical federal funding that Wisconsin schools depend on,” Underly said at a public hearing held by the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee in Kaukana. Underly was not invited for an agency briefing before the committee, so she traveled to deliver her message at the public hearing.
Her requests for state investment include increasing the state’s special education reimbursement for schools, funding universal free school meals and investing in mental health supports for students.

(Jim Still-Pepper | iStock via Getty Images)West Virginia officials say they’re reviewing the impacts of potential cuts to a federal program that helped thousands of state residents pay for heating and cooling last year. 
The Trump administration, through the Department of Government Efficiency, has reportedly cut the entire staff of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Last year, the program provided utility assistance or aid for repairs to approximately 50,000 households throughout the state.  
“The West Virginia Department of Human Services is aware of discussions regarding federal funding for the Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIEAP),” Angel Hightower, a spokeswoman for the Department of Human Services, wrote in an email to West Virginia Watch. “At this time, we are reviewing any potential impacts on the program and will provide updates as more information becomes available.”
LIEAP is the state’s version of the federal program.
In fiscal year 2024, LIHEAP provided assistance to 45,270 West Virginia households, according to the state. In addition, 3,235 West Virginia households got help from Emergency LIHEAP, another 846 homes got assistance for heating system repairs and replacements, and 586 homes got weatherization services through the program.
Nationally, the program provided 5.9 million households with a total of $6.2 billion in funding in 2023, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
The layoffs at LIHEAP were part of Health and Human Services’ larger reduction in force of 10,000 employees that officials say will save taxpayers $1.8 billion per year. 
The restructuring will “streamline” functions of the department, consolidating 28 divisions into 15, including a new “Administration for a Healthy America.” The department will prioritize ending chronic disease by focusing on “safe, wholesome food, clean water and the elimination of environmental toxins,” the department said. 
“We aren’t just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic,” HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. said in a statement. “This department will do more — a lot more — at a lower cost to the taxpayer.”
When asked about how the restructuring will affect LIHEAP, HHS press secretary Vianca N. Rodriguez Feliciano wrote in an email that “HHS will continue to comply with [statutory] requirements, and as a result of the reorganization, will be better positioned to execute on Congress’s statutory intent.” 
She did not respond to a followup question asking for clarification.

Scott Cupps strolled into a Missouri Capitol hearing room wearing a sports coat made of old quilts and toting a hand-cranked Bingo ball spinner.  The jacket was a gift from friends back in his Shell Knob district, commissioned by his grandmother’s old quilt club. The Bingo spinner, procured from “the nuns at St. [&#8230;]","State Rep. Scott Cupps, a Republican from Shell Knob, speaks March 3 in the Missouri House (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).State Rep. Scott Cupps strolled into a Missouri Capitol hearing room wearing a sports coat made of old quilts and toting a hand-cranked Bingo ball spinner. 
The jacket was a gift from friends back in his Shell Knob district, commissioned by his grandmother’s old quilt club. The Bingo spinner, procured from “the nuns at St. Mary’s Hospital” in Jefferson City, was how Cupps planned to decide which bills would take another step toward becoming law — and which would continue to languish. 
Cupps is chair of the House’s legislative rules committee, a gig that historically acts as equal parts rubber stamp and bottle neck for legislation. It receives bills after they’ve cleared another legislative committee, checks them for possible errors, then shuffles them along to the calendar of bills eligible for debate by the full chamber or sends them back to their original committee for changes. 
Some bills glide through. Others get hung up. The chair, usually in consultation with the speaker of the House that appointed them, gets to decide. 
And after being appointed chair of the committee this year by fellow Republican House Speaker Jon Patterson, Cupps — fulfilling a promise made to his friends by always showing up to hearings donning his quilted “rules chair jacket” — has made it abundantly clear he’s not interested in being a rubber stamp.
“If they wanted someone that was going to go through the charade of what a rules chair has been in the past, of rubber stamping my friends’ stuff and not communicating with the committee at all, that’s not me,” Cupps said. “That’s just not my personality.”
 State Rep. Scott Cupps choses which bills will be approved on Wednesday in the House legislative rules committee while wearing his “rules chair jacket” (photo submitted by Rep. Keri Ingle).
So Wednesday, upset that his committee has so far only been assigned one Senate bill, Cupps announced he would allow only five House bills to progress for every Senate bill his committee was assigned. 
And to ensure he couldn’t be accused of playing favorites, he let the Bingo balls decide. 
“We’re going to do things just a little bit different than we have in the past,” Cupps told the committee at the start of the hearing, adding: “And because there’s some bills on our agenda that I like and some I just absolutely hate, but I don’t hate the sponsor, I figure let’s just give everybody an equal, fair shot.”
Cupps gave one bill, which targeted nondisclosure agreements in childhood sexual abuse cases, the “free space,” to use Bingo jargon, because it has bipartisan support and is too important not to move along. 
Five others were then chosen at random using the ball spinner. 
His motivation, he said, is that at this point in the session, with only six weeks left before the legislature adjourns for the year, most House bills are never going to get through on their own. 
They’ll likely only succeed as amendments to Senate bills. So why spend time vetting a bunch of House bills unless the committee is also doing its due diligence on the Senate bills they’ll be attached to? 
“​​I want to be in a spot where my committee, not me, but my committee, gets to have input on some of those discussions,” he said, “and it’s hard to have input on those discussions if you don’t have some of the Senate bills that could eventually end up on the governor’s desk.”
The reaction, Cupps said, wasn’t terribly surprising. 
Lobbyists were incredulous. Lawmakers were furious. Cupps was accused of making a mockery of the legislative process. 
Cupps said he’s trying to prove a point.
“Yeah, there’s been some shenanigans,” he said, “but I am just trying to keep trash off the (debate) calendar and really focus on bills that mean something to my colleagues and their constituents, not some out–of-state lobby group. And focus on the bigger picture of how they fit into Senate bills that will ultimately be how they become law.”
Not everyone is convinced of Cupps’ noble goals, though. 
He originally wanted to be named vice chair of the powerful House budget committee, an appointment that would put him in line to be the committee’s chair in two years. 
But Patterson went with state Rep. Bishop Davidson instead. 
Getting passed over didn’t sit particularly well with Cupps, and his disappointment seemed to manifest into legislation. 
In February, he began to file bills that would rename every bridge in the state after Davidson; change the name of Taum Sauk Mountain to the “Bishop Davidson Summit”; change the name of the Katy Trail to the “Bishop Davidson Trail”; and change the name of the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to the “Bishop Davidson Curriculum Distribution Department.”
So far, none of the bills have been assigned to a committee. 
“I’m just trying to get the guy the credit he deserves,” Cupps said, brushing off a question about whether he was acting out of frustration and noting that one of Davidson’s bills was among the five passed out of committee last week after being chosen using the Bingo ball spinner. 
“Proof that we’re just trying to be fair,” he said. 
State Rep. Keri Ingle, a Lee’s Summit Democrat who has served on the rules committee for seven years, said in an interview the day after the Bingo hearing that “it’s infrequent that I see something in this building that surprises me. And yesterday was rather surprising.”
There appears to be, Ingle said, “a lot of internal conflict within the Republican conference, specifically around some of the chairs of the committees, and I think that that is now spilling out into public.”
But the intent of the rules committee, Ingle said, seems to have always been to either slow down bad legislation or allow further negotiations. By that standard, Cupps’ “crazy displays” are unusual, but the outcome isn’t. 
“I remember my first two years when the rules chairs, Holly Rehder and Rocky Miller, ran rules in a very specific way and held Senate bills and House bills until the (prescription drug monitoring bill) was heard in the Senate,” she said. “And so I know that, historically, it has been used in such a way.”
And the committee has taken action on lots of bills this year, Ingle notes. According to the House website, Cupps’ committee has passed 103 of the 143 bills it has been assigned so far this year.

For his part, Cupps said the Bingo-ball method was not intended to be disrespectful. He considers Patterson a close friend and believes the speaker knew what kind of chairman he would be when he appointed him. 
“I sure am not going to speak for the speaker, because I do consider him a friend,” Cupps said. “But I will tell you, I believe that he knows me well enough that appointing me meant he wanted someone who was going to use the rules committee as a way to actually vet not only individual pieces of legislation, but what the legislation it actually potentially could turn into.”
Patterson may not have known “exactly what he was getting into,” Cupps said with a laugh,”but I don’t think he’s shocked and flabbergasted.”
Through a spokesman, Patterson declined comment. 
The rules committee is scheduled to meet again Monday. 
Unless the flooding in his district keeps him from making the trip , Cupps will be there with his “rules chair jacket” and Bingo ball spinner. He’ll convene the hearing using a gavel he’s dubbed “liberado” — another gift from longtime family friends, adorned with shotgun shells and rifle cartridge casings from his great-grandfather’s general store and held together by a cultivator shank that used to belong to his dad. 
The committee was assigned another Senate bill on Thursday, so five more House bills may very well continue on in the process. 
“We have the best committee in the House,” Cupps said. “It might sound like I am saying that in jest, but I really believe that. We communicate well together. We have people from very diverse backgrounds with knowledge in different areas. So when we’re talking about actual legislation that we might turn into law in the state of Missouri, hey, let’s allow us to be part of that conversation.”

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The state of Florida may enforce a law eliminating general education courses that teach “identity politics” at Florida’s institutions of higher education pending resolution of a lawsuit filed by professors, a federal judge has ruled.
In January, the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida filed suit on the professors’ behalf alleging that SB 266, a 2023 law limiting general education course classifications and funding for diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, harmed the professors’ academic ambitions. General education courses are required for students to graduate. 
Days after a preliminary injunction hearing in Tallahassee in front of U.S. District Chief Judge Mark Walker, he ruled Wednesday that the professors had not established theywould suffer any harm.
‘Viewpoint-discriminatory’ higher education law heard for preliminary injunction

“This ruling is disappointing, but also offers a clearer path forward to prove this law is unconstitutional,” said Bacardi Jackson, executive director of the ACLU of Florida in a news release. “The law is a blatant effort to control the content of higher education, muzzle Florida’s scholars, and erase perspectives the state finds politically inconvenient. We remain committed to fighting alongside faculty, students, and the broader academic community until this undemocratic law is struck down.”
Among the plaintiffs is University of Florida political science professor Sharon Austin, who complains she was denied funding to present at a 2024 conference hosted by Diversity Abroad, which the school had paid for her to present at in 2023. The school specifically cited SB 266 in refusing to pay for her to appear subsequently, the suit alleges.
“As for Plaintiff Austin, her declaration demonstrates that she has already suffered a denial of state funding to attend conferences in 2024. However, to obtain prospective relief, she must demonstrate an unambiguous intention to seek funding to attend conferences at a reasonably foreseeable time in the future. That she has not done,” Walker wrote. 
Professors who have had their courses removed from general education requirements, or fear it may happen, say their injury is chilled speech and potential repercussions in post-tenure review. 
“To the extent these Plaintiffs claim their classroom speech associated with courses for which they have no stated plans to teach at a reasonably foreseeable time in the future will be chilled, such a hypothetical future chill is both too remote and speculative to amount to a cognizable injury in fact,” Walker wrote. 
ACLU will continue
The plaintiffs allege viewpoint discrimination under the First Amendment; that the law is over-broad; and that it violates Florida’s Campus Free Expression Act.
State University System Chancellor Ray Rodrigues said in January that the law has helped address a Gallup poll that found “political agendas” as Americans’ Number One reason they have lost confidence in higher education.
Education Commissioner Manny Diaz Jr. said the law helps students who can be “overwhelmed by the number of courses that are out there,” and that students can take whatever classes they wish, “but the easier we can make it for them when it comes to general education and making sure that they’re getting what they need there I think is very important.”
Walker did not rule on merits of the underlying case and the ACLU said it will continue its challenge. 
“Plaintiffs’ evidence does not demonstrate that any Plaintiff faces an imminent injury — namely, chilled speech — that is traceable to any Defendant’s enforcement of the general education requirements,” Walker wrote. 
“For what it’s worth, Plaintiffs’ existential concerns about the survival of their academic departments and the future viability of their areas of expertise in the state of Florida are certainly understandable. However, these concerns, as described at length in Plaintiffs’ declarations, do not give rise to a concrete, imminent, and non-speculative injury in fact sufficient to permit Plaintiffs to seek a preliminary injunction against Defendants’ enforcement of the general education requirements.”

Included in the massive federal workforce cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services this week was the elimination of an office that runs a program over 100,000 Missouri families rely on to help pay their heating and cooling bills. 
The layoffs within the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which provides Congressionally-approved funds that are administered by Missouri’s social services department, leaves the program’s future in limbo. 
LIHEAP is designed to help those with few resources cover their home energy bills in the summer and winter. Since October, the program has helped offset utility costs for 100,839 households, according to a spokesperson for the Department of Social Services.
The state received over $136.4 million for the program in fiscal year 2023, and the average benefit for the heating and cooling program was around $675 per household.
The Department of Social Services has “not received any official updates regarding potential program reductions,” said spokesperson Baylee Watts, and the federal government hasn’t announced program cuts. But advocates fear that without the federal staff, the future allocation of funding is uncertain. 
“Any cuts to LIHEAP will be detrimental to Missourians who are already struggling to keep up with increasing electric and gas bills,” said Sandra Padgett, executive director of Consumers Council of Missouri, in a press release. 
States are still waiting for around 10% of their annual funding allocation for the federal fiscal year that began in October. That amount usually arrives in June. Watts said Missouri hasn’t been notified yet of what that amount is, but it was $8.1 million last year. 
Those funds aren’t expected to be needed until the fiscal year that starts in October, though, Watts said, based on the way Missouri has allocated funding.
“At this moment, DSS does not anticipate any impact on services,” Watts said.
At the same time, a bill adding a charge onto utility bills passed the state legislature and is awaiting the governor’s signature.

Jerry Moran seeks passage of bill offering $50 million annually for transportation projects assisting hosts of World Cup or Olympic competition.,"U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, filed bipartisan legislation to deliver as much as $50 million in federal transportation infrastructure grant funding to cities hosting 2026 World Cup events and Olympic competition in 2028 and 2034. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of U.S. Senate YouTube channel)TOPEKA — U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas reintroduced federal legislation to set aside $50 million annually for transportation infrastructure projects in support of cities hosting the 2026 FIFA World Cup, 2028 Summer Olympic Games and 2034 Winter Olympic Games.
Moran’s primary interest was a section of the bill earmarking funding to 11 U.S. cities, including Kansas City, selected to host Men’s World Cup competition next year.
“It was a tremendous feat to secure a spot as a host city during the 2026 World Cup, and I have no doubt that Kansas City will be a welcoming community for hundreds of thousands of soccer fans from around the world,” the Republican senator said. “Preparations are already underway for the games and this legislation will support local community and agency efforts to improve infrastructure to connect fans with businesses, hotels, the airport and other host cities during the World Cup.”
Other cities hosting World Cup competition are Seattle, Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York and New Jersey, Philadelphia and the San Francisco Bay area.
U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat and a member with Moran on the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, said the proposed federal funding would help communities safely and efficiently coordinate transportation for fans, workers and goods during World Cup and Olympic events.
“With less than 500 days until Seattle hosts its first 2026 World Cup game, we need the Department of Transportation to get in the game and support host cities as they work to showcase the best of American innovation and hospitality,” she said.
Under the Senate bill, host cities and surrounding communities would be eligible for grants to build roads, expand light rail, purchase buses, create bicycle lanes, improve existing roads and upgrade airport terminals for the World Cup as well as the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles and the 2034 Olympics in Salt Lake City. Text of the bill indicated funding also could be used for Paralympics, Special Olympics and women’s World Cup events.
Financial aid funneled through the U.S. transportation agency could be spread among host cities, states and tribes within 100 miles of the sports venues, the bill said.
“We are pleased to see this important transportation assistance legislation introduced in support of Kansas City’s World Cup efforts,” said Pam Kramer, chief executive officer of KC2026. “These investments and support will help us create sustained and lasting impact beyond the World Cup, improving mobility in the region well beyond 2026.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Moran-on-USAID-1-1024x524.png,,,2025-04-04 14:10:37.158120

(Photo by Alex Goodlett for Utah News Dispatch)Perhaps the most eloquent summation of America in the age of Donald Trump comes from the famous quote of eighteenth-century French Enlightenment philosopher and acerbic social critic François-Marie Arouet, known by his pen name as Voltaire. He wrote, “Those who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities.”
Trump has been dragging this country into a land littered with “absurdities” and non-reality since he rode down the escalator in 2015.  Now in his second term, teamed up with apex predator and wolf in DOGE clothing, Elon Musk, those absurdities are in full bloom as authoritarian, Nazi-saluting moral atrocities.
Public protests have sprung up throughout the country on almost every move Trump and Musk have made. One of the most important protest movements, but least publicized, is “Stand Up for Science.” I attended the rally in Salt Lake City on March 8 along with hundreds of other Utahns. But next time the attendance should be hundreds of thousands.
Two weeks ago, new director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Lee Zeldin, announced that EPA’s mission would be flipped on its head, i.e. it would no longer be to protect human life, public health and our air, water, and environment from contamination, but to “lower the cost of buying a car, heating a home and running a business.” Even from an economic standpoint this is an absurdity.
On average the economic benefits to EPA regulations established through the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act have been about 30 times the cost to industry of complying with those regulations.  Even the narrowest of interpretations of that equation finds a 3-to-1 benefit ratio. It is primarily thanks to EPA regulations on smoke stack and tail pipe emissions that Utah’s particulate pollution (PM2.5) has generally improved in the last 20 years (although that improvement is being eroded by more wildfire pollution).  A recent study from Utah scientists estimated that up to 8,000 Utahns die, and economic losses are up to $3.3 billion a year, due to current levels of pollution.
Voltaire would have cringed at Zeldin boasting the EPA will do its part to “power the great American comeback.” Comeback to what? More dead and sick Utahns and more economic losses?  Even if you assign no economic value to your own health, quality of life, or life expectancy, fossil fuel generated energy is now more expensive than clean energy.
On the EPA’s official website, Zeldin boasts, “We are driving a dagger through the heart of the climate change religion.” A MAGA cultist slandering the most important scientific reality in human history as a “religion” is right from the authoritarian play book: accuse your opposition of the very atrocities you’re committing.
Over 99.9% of climate research dating back to 1807, has confirmed an accelerating climate crisis from increasing atmospheric CO2.  It’s been declared the greatest public health threat of the 21st century by the world’s top 200 medical journals. Even the oil industry’s scientists identified looming catastrophic global warming with “shocking skill and accuracy” as early the 1970s.  As we all know, the industry betrayed their own science, deciding that saving humanity would not interfere with quarterly profits.
That Musk promotes himself as a scientific genius while spearing heading some of the most anti-science delusions infecting the Trump Administration is particularly galling. Trump’s entire cabinet, their party’s Congressional majorities, and even some Democrats have for years personified the scientific absurdity and moral atrocity warned about by Voltaire.
For their part, our legislature keeps telling themselves that Utah is the best managed state in the nation. The 25,000-80,000 Utahns that died in the last decade from our air pollution might think otherwise. Our legislature is also disconnected from the wishes of their undead constituency, with their ongoing determination to wrest control of public lands away from the federal government, and to immunize Utah against mythical “federal regulatory overreach.” 
A Colorado College annual poll found that 76% of Utahns want their leaders “to place more emphasis on protecting water, air, wildlife habitat, and recreation opportunities over maximizing the amount of land available for drilling and mining.” Fifty-seven percent “oppose giving state government control over national public lands,” such as forests, monuments, and wildlife refuges. Nearly two thirds support government action “to reduce carbon pollution that contributes to climate change.” Yet our leaders persist in doing the opposite.
For example, Utah has spent your tax dollars fighting the “Good Neighbor Rule” which would have required reducing pollution from our coal power plants that send death and disease over to Colorado, as if those lives mean nothing. How does anyone square that moral failure with the Parable of the Good Samaritan whose virtue so many of our legislators hear extolled in their church services?
If Voltaire targeted his pen on the vaunted “Utah Way” in the era of Donald Trump, I’m pretty sure he would say, “Yup, nailed it.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ScienceProtest_010-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-04-04 13:09:27.900307

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — After a year on hold, there’s still no end in sight for the criminal case against the co-founders of Epic Charter School.
Yet another delay emerged Friday as defendant David Lee Chaney, 45, requested that the judge in charge of the case recuse, said an attorney who attended a closed-door meeting where the request was made. Fellow co-founder Benjamin Scott Harris, 49, kept the case in limbo for much of the past year while pursuing the same tactic.
Harris and Chaney were charged in 2022 with racketeering and a litany of financial crimes. Prosecutors alleged the co-founders engineered a complex scheme to enrich themselves with millions of taxpayer dollars intended for Epic students.
The co-founders, who started Epic in 2011, deny that any of their business practices were illegal. Their attorneys said Harris and Chaney were successful businessmen following the advice of their legal counsel while their virtual charter school rapidly grew into the largest public school system in the state during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Epic cut all ties with the co-founders in 2021. The school educates nearly 31,000 students across Oklahoma, about half as many as it did during its peak enrollment in 2020.
Prosecutors from the Attorney General’s Office began laying out their case against Harris and Chaney in a preliminary hearing in March 2024. A judge would decide after the hearing concludes whether the state has collected enough evidence for the case to continue to trial.
A week wasn’t enough time for attorneys on both sides of the case to question witnesses and discuss evidence. Similarly, a year hasn’t been enough to resolve various conflicts that have blocked the hearing from proceeding.

On the day the preliminary hearing was meant to resume in May, attorneys representing the case’s star witness and co-defendant, former Epic CFO Joshua Aaron Brock, filed a request for Chaney’s lawyer to recuse.
Brock, 43, contended that Chaney’s attorney, Gary Wood, used to represent him, too. It would be unethical for Wood to cross-examine a former client, his filing stated.
Wood denied ever representing Brock.
Before the matter of Wood’s disqualification was resolved, an attorney representing Harris called for the judge in charge of the case to recuse last year. Defense attorney Joe White accused district Judge Susan Stallings of having bias in favor of the prosecution.
Stallings would preside over the co-founders’ trial, if the case ever gets that far, and she is tasked with deciding whether Wood should be disqualified.

Stallings refused to step down from the case, and White appealed the decision three times. 
His string of appeals came to an end in February when the Oklahoma Supreme Court declined to hear his arguments, instead opting to uphold lower court decisions that favored keeping Stallings on the case.
Now, Chaney has asked Stallings to recuse. His attorney, Wood, made the request in a confidential meeting with the judge on Friday. 
Afterward, Wood declined to comment on any matters discussed in the closed courtroom. The Attorney General’s Office also declined to comment.
Another attorney present in the meeting, Chris Box, who represents Brock, confirmed Wood asked Stallings to disqualify herself because a lawyer from the Attorney General’s Office represented her in the prior recusal appeals. Box said the judge will hear the disqualification request again in a public hearing at 2:30 p.m. May 2.

If the past year is any indication, it could take several months to resolve the dispute.
Attorneys requesting that a judge step down first do so in private, like what happened Friday. If the judge declines, the attorney could repeat the request in a public court hearing. 
If denied again, the attorney could appeal to the county’s chief district judge, a role the district judges accept on a rotating basis. Then, the matter could be elevated to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals and finally the state Supreme Court.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Wanted: investors to back $165 million for the sale of two Rhode Island hospitals with a troubled past and uncertain future, according to one major credit rating agency.
Sound appealing? 
Members of the state’s quasi-public financing agency hope so, noting that the borrowing is crucial to close the deal selling Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital to new, nonprofit owners. The Rhode Island Health and Educational Building Corp. authorized the sale of up to $165 million in taxable and tax-exempt bonds by a 4-1 vote Thursday.
Rescuing the pair of urban safety net hospitals from owner Prospect Medical Holdings has been a complicated and long-winding journey, even before Prospect filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January. The Centurion Foundation, an Atlanta-based nonprofit, emerged as the only interested and “viable” candidate two years ago. Its $80 million offer, backed by debt financing, with no direct equity investment of its own, raised alarm among hospital union workers.
But state regulators with the Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General and the Rhode Island Department of Heath ultimately signed off in June 2024, attaching a list of 85 conditions meant to protect hospital operations, workers and patients even if the new owner runs into financial trouble. Conditions included a separate $80 million capital injection — on top of the $80 million sale price — for the hospitals’ balance sheet, along with a separate, $66.8 million escrow fund that cannot be used for executive compensation or management fees. 
But S&P Global Ratings Agency was unconvinced by the credit stability of the CharterCARE Health of Rhode Island, the new Rhode Island subsidiary formed by Centurion. The credit ratings agency gave the bonds a BB- rating, which denotes a relatively high risk for a non-investment grade bond. S&P analysts in a corresponding March 25 report noted the “significant uncertainty” surrounding future financial, strategic and operating performance, anticipating a 33% chance of a rating downgrade within a year.
Meanwhile, Acacia Financial Group, a consultant for the quasi-public state financing agency, was unable to draw conclusions about the stability of the new CharterCARE subsidiary nor independently verify projections submitted by a separate consultant, VMG Health, according to the report submitted to the board, and obtained by Rhode Island Current.
Current owner Prospect’s Rhode Island subsidiary ended fiscal year 2023 with a $60 million loss for its Rhode Island hospitals and related physician groups, according to audited statements. VMG Health in a February 2025 feasibility study projected operating losses would continue for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025, but that the new owners would be back in the black by fiscal 2026 by more than $5 million, according to the report given to the board.
The alternative does not exist
Board members weighed the financial risk of the borrowing against the alternative: not issuing the bonds could jeopardize the sale, and in turn, the future of the hospitals.
“I know this is a difficult decision, but there is no alternative,” Jeffrey Liebman, CharterCARE CEO, said during the meeting. “I have watched other hospitals close, here, in Massachusetts and across the country. I don’t want you to think there is a long timeline here for these hospitals to survive if you don’t take this vote.”
The two hospitals, with 500 beds between them, account for more than 50,000 emergency room visits per year. Together they have 104 beds for behavioral health patients, representing more than 20% of behavioral health beds available statewide.
Lisa Andoscia, the only board member who voted against the bond sale, said it was “too risky.”
“Rhode Island needs to be resilient and deserves an experienced operator for Fatima and Roger Williams hospitals,” Andoscia said in an interview Friday. “They deserve an owner who brings financial stability and operational preparedness to make these essential hospitals financially viable in the future.”
Andoscia added, “I think it’s just a short-term stop to the hemorrhaging.”
Municipal leaders in Providence and North Providence, which host the pair of hospitals, are also not happy. Providence Mayor Brett Smiley, North Providence Mayor Charles Lombardi and the North Providence Town Council expressed concern in separate letters about financial losses when the sale goes through. Standing agreements between the municipalities and Prospect provide lump sum payments to the host communities instead of regular property taxes; without new, or continued agreements, the communities stand to lose a combined $8.5 million in fiscal 2026, Smiley and Lombardi wrote in a joint letter on Nov. 1, 2024.
“These unsustainable losses will lead to devastating cuts to our annual operating budgets,” Smiley and Lombardi wrote.
Smiley and Lombardi asked the board to require as part of its financing approval that the new owners honor the existing payment plans until they negotiate new ones with municipal leaders. But that’s outside the board’s purview, Dylan Zelazo, executive director, said in a written reply to Smiley and Lombardi on March 21.
Liebman said during the meeting that Centurion was willing to work with municipal leaders to set up new payment agreements. 
The pair of taxable and tax-exempt bonds are backed by mortgages on the hospitals and any revenue derived from their operations. The approved financing agreement also requires the borrowers to keep a reserve fund equal to 110% of annual debt service, and a minimum cash flow to cover 40 days of payments.
In addition to the pair of taxable and tax-exempt bonds, the new owners are also assuming the $43 million balance on a low-interest PACE loan Prospect took out in 2021, as well as its leases. 
Together, the new and existing debt payments require the new owners to spend $404 million paying off principal and interest through 2055, according to a projected payment schedule by Acacia Financial Group. The highest single-year debt payment comes in 2035, when the $67.5 million in taxable bond matures, requiring nearly $60 million in principal and interest payments on that bond alone.
The proposed timeline included in the report anticipates the sale will close on April 30, providing bankers can find investors to purchase the bonds.
Otis Brown, a spokesperson for CharterCARE, expressed gratitude for the board’s approval to authorize the bond financing.
We now look forward to securing funding to support our acquisition of these two critical hospitals and the preservation of 2,700 jobs and dedicated employees,” Brown said in an emailed response Thursday.
He did not respond to follow up questions regarding concern over credit and financial stability of the new ownership.

,DC,2025-04-04 16:54:24+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,'Really scared': Parents of kids with disabilities confront Education Department chaos,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/really-scared-parents-kids-disabilities-confront-education-department-chaos,,"WASHINGTON — As President Donald Trump takes drastic steps to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, disability advocates are worried about whether the agency can carry out its responsibilities to serve students with disabilities.Representatives of several disability advocacy groups cited “chaos,” “fear” and “uncertainty” in describing the situation to States Newsroom. They said there’s a lack of clarity about both proposed changes within the realm of special education services and the impact overall of sweeping shifts at the agency, calling into question whether the department can deliver on its congressionally mandated guarantees for students with disabilities.“It’s only been a few weeks since these things started happening, so I don’t think we’re seeing any of the effects trickle down right now, but we do have parents reaching out to us, calling and feeling really scared,” said Robyn Linscott, director of education and family policy at The Arc of the United States, an advocacy group for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.Among the department’s chief responsibilities is guaranteeing a free public education for students with disabilities through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, and enforcing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, part of which bars programs and activities receiving federal funding from discrimination on the basis of disability.The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act was enacted in 1975 under a different title and later renamed in 1990.IDEA “governs how states and public agencies provide early intervention, special education, and related services” to students with disabilities, per the department.The department notes that before the 1975 law, “many children were denied access to education and opportunities to learn” and in 1970, “U.S. schools educated only one in five children with disabilities.” According to the National Center for Education Statistics, 15% of all public school students in the country received services through IDEA during the 2022-2023 school year.In fiscal year 2024, $15.4 billion was appropriated for IDEA.Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 states that: “No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States ... shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.Closing the departmentTrump signed an executive order in March that called on Education Secretary Linda McMahon to “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure” of the agency to the maximum extent she’s permitted to by law.The department also announced earlier that month that it would be slashing more than 1,300 positions through a “reduction in force,” or RIF effort, sparking widespread concerns about how the department could deliver on its core functions.

For special education services, advocates question significant cuts to units like the Office for Civil Rights, which is tasked with investigating discrimination complaints, including those that are disability-based.Linscott said parents are asking questions such as: “‘What does this mean? Is my child still going to be able to have an (Individualized Education Program)? Is the state going to be required to uphold the IDEA? Or, I have a pending complaint with (the Office for Civil Rights), what does this mean for how long it’s going to take to settle this case or to investigate this claim?’”Heather Eckner, director of statewide education at the Autism Alliance of Michigan, said it’s been “all-consuming” trying to keep up with what she calls a “chaos factory,” noting that it’s a lot of work for advocacy groups and policy analysts “to try to sort through and figure out what’s real, what’s actually happening, what might happen, and where the impact might be.”“Ultimately, this is just having a significant destabilizing effect,” said Eckner, whose statewide organization focuses on expanding opportunities for people with autism.Moving special education services to HHSThat uncertainty also stems from Trump’s announcement in March that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services “will be handling special needs.”The proposal sparked concern and confusion among disability advocates, both for what that transfer would look like and the legality of the proposed move. The president offered little detail into the proposal, but HHS secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said on social media that the agency is “fully prepared” to take on that responsibility.Meanwhile, HHS is witnessing its own drastic changes and restructuring, including beginning to lay off 10,000 workers — further calling into question how that agency could take on the Education Department’s special education services.In response to a request for comment, HHS directed States Newsroom to Kennedy’s social media post regarding the proposed transfer but did not provide any further details.“We have a lot of concerns over both the legality of that, but also just what that means for kind of how we view the education of students with disabilities in general, and how do we view disability in this country, and then what those actual implications on students are,” Linscott said. Jennifer Coco, interim executive director at the Center for Learner Equity, told States Newsroom that any move to separate the education of students with disabilities from the education of all students “further pathologizes disability and is treating 15% of all the children in our public school buildings like they’re medical issues — they’re not.”“They are students who learn differently, a vast majority of whom could learn at the same grade level as their peers if they were provided appropriate instruction,” said Coco, whose national nonprofit focuses on ensuring students with disabilities have access to quality educational opportunities, including public school choice.Any transfer of responsibility for these federal laws, such as IDEA, would require an act of Congress — a significant undertaking given that at least 60 votes are needed to break through the Senate’s filibuster and Republicans, with their narrow majority, hold just 53 seats.The Education Department told States Newsroom that no action has been taken to move federally mandated programs out of the agency at this time.“As President Trump and Secretary McMahon have made clear, sunsetting the Department of Education will be done in partnership with Congress and national and state leaders to ensure all statutorily required programs are managed responsibly and where they best serve students and families,” Madi Biedermann, a spokesperson for the department, said in a statement shared with States Newsroom.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-04-04 13:09:27.900307

To receive public assistance in Idaho, state agencies are largely required to verify the lawful presence of adults applying for benefits. But Idaho law spells out exceptions for certain services, including emergency health care, immunization, communicable disease testing and treatment, prenatal and postnatal care, and food assistance for dependent children.
House Bill 135 removes some of those exceptions — requiring state agencies to verify someone’s immigration status for those services.
Under the bill, some emergency services remain exempt from the immigration status verification requirement. 
The new law takes effect July 1. 
Democrats cast the bill as cruel. 
“Have we as a society lost all respect for decency? I haven’t been able to answer that one yet. I think that question remains to be answered.

In January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order pausing federal grants and loans, alarming HBCUs, where most students rely on Pell Grants or federal aid. The order was later rescinded, but ongoing cuts leave key support systems in political limbo, said Denise Smith, deputy director of higher education policy and a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a left-leaning think tank.
Leaders worry about Trump’s rollback of the Justice40 Initiative, a climate change program that relied on HBCUs to tackle environmental justice issues, she said. And there’s uncertainty around programs such as federal work-study and TRIO, which provides college access services to disadvantaged students.
“People are being mum because we’re starting to see a chilling effect,” Smith said. “There’s real fear that resources could be lost at any moment — even the ones schools already know they need to survive.”
Most students at HBCUs rely on Pell Grants or other federal aid, and a fifth of Black college graduates matriculate from HBCUs. Other minority-serving institutions, known as MSIs, that focus on Hispanic and American Indian populations also heavily depend on federal aid.
“It’s still unclear what these cuts will mean for HBCUs and MSIs, even though they’re supposedly protected,” Smith said.
States may be unlikely to make up any potential federal funding cuts to their public HBCUs. And the schools already have been underfunded by states compared with predominantly white schools.
Congress created public, land-grant universities under the Morrill Act of 1862 to serve the country’s agricultural and industrial industries, providing 10 million acres taken from tribes and offering it for public universities such as Auburn and the University of Georgia. But Black students were excluded.
The 1890 Morrill Act required states to either integrate or establish separate land-grant institutions for Black students — leading to the creation of many HBCUs. These schools have since faced chronic underfunding compared with their majority-white counterparts.
 ‘None of them are equitable’

In 2020, the average endowment of white land-grant universities was $1.9 billion, compared with just $34 million for HBCUs, according to Forbes.
There are other HBCUs that don’t stem from the 1890 law, including well-known private schools such as Fisk University, Howard University, Morehouse College and Spelman College. But more than three-fourths of HBCU students attend public universities, meaning state lawmakers play a significant role in their funding and oversight.
Marybeth Gasman, an endowed chair in education and a distinguished professor at Rutgers University, isn’t impressed by what states have done for HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions so far. She said she isn’t sure there is a state model that can bridge the massive funding inequities for these institutions, even in states better known for their support.
“I don’t think North Carolina or Maryland have done a particularly good job at the state level. Nor have any of the other states. Students at HBCUs are funded at roughly 50-60% of what students at [predominately white institutions] are funded. That’s not right,” said Gasman.
“Most of the bipartisan support has come from the U.S. Congress and is the result of important work by HBCUs and affiliated organizations. I don’t know of a state model that works well, as none of them are equitable.”
Under federal law, states that accept federal land-grant funding are required to match every dollar with state funds.
But in 2023, the Biden administration sent letters to 16 governors warning them that their public Black land-grant institutions had been underfunded by more than $12 billion over three decades.
Tennessee State University alone had a $2.1 billion gap with the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
At a February meeting hosted by the Tennessee Black Caucus of State Legislators, Tennessee State interim President Dwayne Tucker said the school is focused on asking lawmakers this year for money to keep the school running.
Otherwise, Tucker said at the time, the institution could run out of cash around April or May.
“That’s real money. That’s the money we should work on,” Tucker said, according to a video of the forum.
In some states, lawsuits to recoup long-standing underfunding have been one course of action.
In Maryland, a landmark $577 million legal settlement was reached in 2021 to address decades of underfunding at four public HBCUs.
In Georgia, three HBCU students sued the state in 2023 for underfunding of three HBCUs.
In Tennessee, a recent state report found Tennessee State University has been shortchanged roughly $150 million to $544 million over the past 100 years.
But Tucker said he thinks filing a lawsuit doesn’t make much sense for Tennessee State.
“There’s no account payable set up with the state of Tennessee to pay us $2.1 billion,” Tucker said at the February forum. “And if we want to make a conclusion about whether [that money] is real or not … you’re going to have to sue the state of Tennessee, and I don’t think that makes a whole lot of sense.”
 Economic anchors

There are 102 HBCUs across 19 states, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands, though a large number of HBCUs are concentrated in the South.
Alabama has the most, with 14, and Pennsylvania has the farthest north HBCU.
Beyond education, HBCUs contribute roughly $15 billion annually to their local economies, generate more than 134,000 jobs and create $46.8 billion in career earnings, proving themselves to be economic anchors in under-resourced regions.
Homecoming events at HBCUs significantly bolster local economies, local studies show. North Carolina Central University’s homecoming contributes approximately $2.5 million to Durham’s economy annually.
Similarly, Hampton University’s 2024 homecoming was projected to inject around $3 million into the City of Hampton and the coastal Virginia region, spurred by increased visitor spending and retail sales. In Tallahassee, Florida A&M University’s 2024 homecoming week in October generated about $5.1 million from Sunday to Thursday.
Their significance is especially pronounced in Southern states — such as North Carolina, where HBCUs account for just 16% of four-year schools but serve 45% of the state’s Black undergraduate population.
Smith has been encouraged by what she’s seen in states such as Maryland, North Carolina and Tennessee, which have a combined 20 HBCUs among them. Lawmakers have taken piecemeal steps to expand support for HBCUs through policy and funding, she noted.
Tennessee became the first state in 2018 to appoint a full-time statewide higher education official dedicated to HBCU success for institutions such as Fisk and Tennessee State. Meanwhile, North Carolina launched a bipartisan, bicameral HBCU Caucus in 2023 to advocate for its 10 HBCUs, known as the NC10, and spotlight their $1.7 billion annual economic impact.
“We created a bipartisan HBCU caucus because we needed people in both parties to understand these institutions’ importance. If you represent a district with an HBCU, you should be connected to it,” said North Carolina Democratic Sen. Gladys Robinson, an alum of private HBCU Bennett College and state HBCU North Carolina A&T State University.
“It took constant education — getting folks to come and see, talk about what was going on,” she recalled. “It’s like beating the drum constantly until you finally hear the beat.”
For Robinson, advocacy for HBCUs can be a tough task, especially when fellow lawmakers aren’t aware of the stories of these institutions. North Carolina A&T was among the 1890 land-grant universities historically undermatched in federal agricultural and extension funding.
The NC Promise Tuition Plan, launched in 2018, reduced in-state tuition to $500 per semester and out-of-state tuition to $2,500 per semester at a handful of schools that now include HBCUs Elizabeth City State University and Fayetteville State University; Western Carolina University, a Hispanic-serving institution; and UNC at Pembroke, founded in 1887 to serve American Indians.
Through conversations on the floor of the General Assembly, and with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, Robinson advocated to ensure Elizabeth City State — a struggling HBCU — was included, which helped revive enrollment and public investment.
“I’m hopeful because we’ve been here before,” Robinson said in an interview.
“These institutions were built out of churches and land by people who had nothing, just so we could be educated,” Robinson said. “We have people in powerful positions across the country. We have to use our strength and our voices. Alumni must step up.
“It’s tough, but not undoable.”
Meanwhile, other states are working to recognize certain colleges that offer significant support to Black college students. California last year passed a law creating a Black-serving Institution designation, the first such title in the country. Schools must have programs focused on Black achievement, retention and graduation rates, along with a five-year plan to improve them. Sacramento State is among the first receiving the designation.
And this session, California state Assemblymember Mike Gipson, a Democrat, introduced legislation that proposes a $75 million grant program to support Black and underserved students over five years through the Designation of California Black-Serving Institutions Grant Program. The bill was most recently referred to the Assembly’s appropriations committee.

A federal judge has ordered the staff restated, but the federal government is appealing the decision.","The Science and Technology building  on the campus of Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute in New Mexico, one of the tribal schools that lost federal funding. (Photographer
Dennis Dye/courtesy USGS)After weeks of uncertainty, two tribal colleges have been told they can hire back all employees who were laid off as part of the Trump administration’s deep cuts across the federal workforce in February, part of a judge’s order restoring some federal employees whose positions were terminated.
Haskell Indian Nations University in Kansas and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute, widely known as SIPI, in New Mexico lost about 70 employees in mid-February amid widespread staffing cuts to federal agencies. While most of the nation’s 37 tribal colleges and universities are chartered by American Indian tribes, Haskell and SIPI are not associated with individual tribes and are run by the federal government.

This story about tribal colleges was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

About 55 employees were laid off and 15 accepted offers to resign, according to a lawsuit filed last month by tribes and students. The colleges were forced to cancel or reconfigure a wide range of services, from sports and food service to financial aid and classes. In some cases, instructors were hired by other universities as adjuncts and then sent back to the tribal colleges to keep teaching.
It was not clear this week when and if the workers would return, whether the employees who resigned would also be offered their jobs back, or if the government would allow colleges to fill vacancies. Both colleges said some employees had turned down the offers.
The Bureau of Indian Education, which runs the colleges, declined to answer questions except to confirm the laid-off workers would be offered jobs with back pay to comply with a judge’s order that the government reverse course on thousands of layoffs of probationary employees. But the agency also noted the jobs would be available “as the White House pursues its appeals process,” indicating possible turmoil if an appeals court reinstates the layoffs.
Both colleges said the bureau also has refused to answer most of their questions.
SIPI leaders were told last week that the positions were being restored, said Adam Begaye, chairman of the SIPI Board of Regents. The 270-student college lost 21 employees, he said, four of whom decided to take early retirement. All but one of the remaining 17 agreed to return, Begaye said.
The chaos has been difficult for those employees, he said, and the college is providing counseling.
“We want to make sure they have an easy adjustment, no matter what they’ve endured,” Begaye said.
The chairman of Haskell’s Board of Regents, Dalton Henry, said he was unsure how many of the 50 lost employees were returning. Like SIPI, Haskell was forced after the layoffs to shift job responsibilities and increase the workload for instructors and others.
Haskell was reviewed by accreditors in December, and Henry said he was worried how the turmoil would affect the process. Colleges and universities must be accredited to offer federal and state financial aid and participate in most other publicly funded programs. 
Henry declined to discuss his thoughts on the chaos, saying there was nothing the college could do about it.
“Whatever guidance is provided, that’s what we have to adhere to,” he said. “It’s a concern. But at this point, it’s the federal government’s decision.”
The Bureau of Indian Affairs declined to make the presidents of the two colleges available for interviews. 
Tribal colleges and universities were established to comply with treaties and the federal trust responsibility, legally binding agreements in which the United States promised to fund Indigenous education and other needs. But college leaders argue the country has violated those contracts by consistently failing to fund the schools adequately.
In the federal lawsuit claiming the Haskell and SIPI cuts were illegal, students and tribes argued the Bureau of Indian Education has long understaffed the colleges. The agency’s “well-documented and persistent inadequacies in operating its schools range from fiscal mismanagement to failure to provide adequate education to inhospitable buildings,” plaintiffs claimed.
Sen. Jerry Moran and Rep. Tracey Mann, both Kansas Republicans, said before Trump took office that they plan to introduce a bill shifting Haskell from federal control to a congressional charter, which would protect the university from cuts across federal agencies such as the Bureau of Indian Education. 
“[F]or the last few years the university has been neglected and mismanaged by the Bureau of Indian Education,” Moran said in a written statement in December. “The bureau has failed to protect students, respond to my congressional inquiries or meet the basic infrastructure needs of the school.”
The February cuts brought rare public visibility to tribal colleges, most of which are in remote locations. Trump’s executive orders spurred outrage from Indigenous communities and a flurry of national news attention.
“We’re using this chaos as a blessing in disguise to make sure our family and friends in the community know what SIPI provides,” said Begaye, the SIPI board president.
The uncertainty surrounding the colleges’ funding has left a lasting mark, said Ahniwake Rose, president and CEO of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, which advocates for tribal colleges. But she added she was proud of how the schools have weathered the cuts.
“Indian country is always one of the most resourceful and creative populations,” she said. “We’ve always made do with less. I think you saw resilience and creativity from Haskell and SIPI.”

Ed Setzler pitches his RFRA bill at an April 1 press conference. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp kicked off the final day of the 2025 legislative session by signing Senate Bill 36, also known as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), into law, appeasing some Georgian residents who have been calling for stronger protections under state law for free exercise of religion. 
The bill mirrors federal legislation that has been in place since 1993, and imposes new restrictions on state and local governments’ ability to “substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion” unless it is “in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest.” It gained final passage out of the House on April 2 in a 96-70 vote that fell largely along party lines.
Democrats in particular have opposed the bill, arguing that without statewide civil rights protections, a RFRA law would allow Georgians greater leeway to discriminate against LGBTQ people and religious minorities.
Establishing new religious protections under state law has been a goal of the Georgia GOP since shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage in 2015. The bill’s sponsor, Acworth Republican Sen. Ed Setzler, first introduced the legislation nearly a decade ago during the 2016 legislative session. The same year, a similar religious freedom bill passed out of the Georgia Legislature, but was ultimately vetoed by then-Governor Nathan Deal, who said he wanted to keep Georgia “a welcoming state.”
Prior to Deal’s veto, some of Georgia’s largest employers, including Coca Cola and Delta Air Lines, warned that the RFRA bill that the Legislature passed would create a law that made recruiting essential workers more difficult.
In a speech immediately after signing the bill, Kemp downplayed concerns that the bill could increase discrimination, drawing parallels between RFRA and legislation from previous sessions aimed at combating hate crimes in the wake of Ahmaud Arbery’s murder and heightening statewide protections against antisemitism.
“Today I signed SB 36, also known as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA, ensuring that once again at the state level, that Georgians are protected, including Georgians of faith,” he said. “I wanted to let everybody know that despite signing that legislation, Georgia still remains a state that has no place for hate, and I can assure all Georgians of that today.”

During the summer of 2024, countless transgender and gender expansive patients expressed to me fears about what might happen to their access to gender affirming medical care if a conservative administration were to win the White House. This worst-case scenario became reality in the first weeks of 2025, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order redefining legal gender identity as a strict binary of male and female — effectively erasing recognition of nonbinary and transgender individuals and interrupting federal funding to institutions providing gender-affirming health care.
As a transgender health program intern, I have seen providers try to reassure patients of their well-being and safety while they themselves fear how their job will be affected if the laws would drastically alter the way we practice medicine.
As a gay man about to enter the medical profession, I am afraid. The recent wave of anti-trans initiatives pushed by this administration is part of a much broader effort to dismantle diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) programs across the country under the guise of “restoring meritocracy” and “leveling the playing field.” But in health care, the playing field has never been level. Minority populations continue to face disproportionate health risks and barriers to care.
DEIB is the foundation of medical education. It teaches future physicians how to address these disparities and combat the structural inequities that put vulnerable patients at risk. Studies show medical students have felt unprepared to manage transgender and gender expansive patients upon graduation. One study even claimed that only 27% of students were confident in their knowledge of the health needs of transgender patients. Beyond that, they could not correctly answer questions about race-related medical history despite affirming that understanding historical context is important in medicine. This lack of education was always a problem, and efforts were underway to solve it. Eliminating DEIB would not only erode this progress but set us back behind where we were even before we started.
In 2020, the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) rolled out the Structural Competency Curriculum which aims to train providers “to recognize and respond to the impact of upstream, structural factors on patient health and health care.” Since then, medical schools around the country have adopted the values of this curriculum and incorporated it throughout the course of their students’ training. Health equity is a core pillar of medical students’ professional development and should be embedded into the culture of patient-centric care.
When DEIB is dismantled, programs like these disappear, and awareness of health disparities among marginalized patient populations fades from the culture of those whose job is to provide the proper care and treatment.
If physicians are not trained on specific health risks that directly impact transgender patients, how can we provide adequate care? If we are not taught about racial health disparities, how will we work to combat them? If we stop prioritizing inclusion, how can we ensure equal health care for all?
Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity. Legislation cannot change a person’s identity, but it will change their access to health care. Medical schools need to teach this, and we as students want to learn.
Future doctors like me are watching everything that is happening, and we are worried. When students apply to medical school, the number one question they are asked is, “Why medicine?” While the answer to this question can take many different forms, the bottom line is pretty simple: We want to help people. Medical schools can make a monumental difference in how future doctors navigate this political environment and provide care to patients. We urge medical schools to keep teaching us how to do that for all patients.

(Photo illustration by Namthip Muanthongthae / Getty Images)The U.S. government announced last week that two confidential informants and an FBI special agent based in New Mexico’s largest city discovered and seized hundreds of thousands of dollars in virtual currency that officials say was meant for Hamas.
On March 25, a special agent with the Albuquerque field office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation asked a federal court in Washington D.C. for permission to seize the virtual currencies. U.S. Magistrate Judge Matthew J. Sharbaugh signed the application.
According to the agent’s sworn statement attached to the application, in February, FBI Albuquerque “identified a terrorist financing network soliciting donations to the al-Qassam Brigades,” Hamas’ military wing. The U.S. has designated Hamas a terrorist organization.
The FBI agent wrote in the warrant application that he believes the funds are “traceable to, and involved in, a scheme to solicit donations of virtual currency to” Hamas, and to launder those donations on the group’s behalf.
The warrant and associated documents indicate they were filed in the court under seal, meaning they are not publicly available. Source NM searched online federal court records for the case number associated with the warrant but could not find anything.
But the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia attached the records to a March 27 news release in which the government said it disrupted “an ongoing terrorist financing scheme” by seizing approximately $201,400 worth of virtual currency held in wallets and accounts intended to benefit Hamas.
It is unusual for federal prosecutors to publish an otherwise sealed search warrant before actually charging someone with a crime, two sources with knowledge of the federal criminal legal system who asked to remain anonymous told Source NM.
A case usually doesn’t get opened until after someone is formally presented with the charges against them in court, the sources said.
One of the sources suggested that the reason why the DOJ is publicly talking about the case before any charges is that Ed Martin, President Donald Trump’s appointed interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Washington D.C., is “trying to make political hay out of an otherwise normal investigation, in an incredibly irregular way.”
Adam Schiff, a Democratic U.S. senator from California, on Tuesday placed a hold on Martin’s permanent confirmation as D.C.’s top federal prosecutor, alleging Martin had “abused” his role.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia did not return an email seeking comment on the case.
The seized funds were traced from fundraising addresses allegedly controlled by Hamas that were used to launder more than $1.5 million in virtual currency since October 2024, the DOJ said.
FBI Albuquerque is investigating the case alongside the FBI Counterterrorism Division and Cyber Division, according to the news release.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
While the FBI agent’s affidavit only reveals some of what the U.S. government knows about the investigation, it appears to show that the agent’s involvement began when an FBI confidential informant in the U.S. on Feb. 6 alerted them to a post on the instant messenger service Telegram asking supporters to contact an email address allegedly associated with al-Qassam in order to donate. Four days later, the informant sent a message to the email address and received a response a few hours later containing instructions on how to donate, according to the translation included in the warrant.
Another informant on Feb. 17 alerted the agent to seven more places to donate virtual currency that the informant allegedly received by emailing al-Qassam.
The cryptocurrency was held on two platforms based outside of the United States, Binance and Tether, according to the warrant application. In October 2023, U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and U.S. Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.) wrote a letter asking the DOJ to criminally prosecute Binance and Tether.
“We urge the Department of Justice to carefully evaluate the extent to which Binance and Tether are providing material support and resources to support terrorism through violations of applicable sanctions laws and the Bank Secrecy Act,” Lummis and Hill wrote. “To that end, we strongly support swift action by the Department of Justice against Binance and Tether to choke off sources of funding to the terrorists targeting Israel.”
Tether, at the request of federal law enforcement, on March 12 agreed to freeze about $90,000 worth of virtual currency until the FBI could serve the warrant, according to the application.
The agent wrote that Binance “took independent action” to freeze other related accounts, and provided records to the agent about two accounts owned by Palestinians whom the agent believes are “financiers enabling a virtual currency donation network to support Hamas.”
In announcing the seizures, FBI Albuquerque Special Agent in Charge Raul Bujanda said in the news release that “countering terrorism remains the FBI’s number one priority.”
“By successfully disrupting access to funds, we weaken their ability to function,” Bujanda said. “This success demonstrates that financial warfare is a critical component to fight terrorism. We will continue to do everything in our power to protect the American people and pursue justice by depriving terrorist organizations of the resources they need to continue their illicit activity.”
In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for FBI Albuquerque told Source NM that the investigation is ongoing and declined to answer questions about how the case is connected to New Mexico, and whether anyone has been charged with a crime related to the seized money.
“The FBI investigates many different cases across all of our 55 field offices,” spokesperson Margot Cravens wrote. “We pursue cases based on well-defined investigative strategies. As with all of our investigations, we adjust and refine that strategy based on the results of ongoing leads.”

DemasThe Michigan Supreme Court has declined to take on a lawsuit filed by the Democratic-run state Senate seeking to force the Republican-controlled state House to send a batch of already-passed bills to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer for her signature.
The opinion, issued late Wednesday, instead ordered the Michigan Court of Appeals to “expedite its consideration and resolution of this case”, which arose when Michigan Senate Democrats filed a lawsuit to the Court of Claims in February to compel GOP House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Twp.) to send nine bills the Legislature passed in the 2023-24 session to the governor for final approval.
The legislation in question was passed during a tumultuous lame duck session late last year when Democrats still had majorities in both chambers — before Republicans took control of the House on Jan. 1 following their victory in the November election. However, the bills were never sent to Whitmer’s office by outgoing House Democrats, who have yet to articulate why they failed to follow through.
 The bills, which Hall refuses to send to the governor, include measures to levy taxes to fund Detroit-area museums, expand eligibility for the State Police Retirement System and increase the amount public employers have to pay towards employees’ health insurance.
In its order, the Michigan Supreme Court said it was “not persuaded that the questions presented should be reviewed by this court before consideration by the Court of Appeals.”
An initial ruling from Court of Claims Judge Sima Patel determined that while the state Constitution required House leadership to forward the bills to the governor, it doesn’t specify the entity responsible for carrying that task out. As state courts have declined to enforce legislative rules in the past, Patel declined to order the bills be sent for signing.
While both the House and Senate appealed portions of Patel’s decision to the Court of Appeals, Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) had asked the state’s Supreme Court to bypass the lower court and take the case directly. Wednesday’s opinion cut that maneuver off.  
Requests for comment were sent to both Brinks and Hall, but have yet to be returned.

An exterior wall capturing with paint strokes the dominance of crop, livestock and energy industries in downtown Medicine Lodge and a doorway in Beloit depicting life in an underwater environment accomplish the same objective.

“Public art is a powerful tool for rural revitalization and bringing vitality and prosperity to all regions of our state,” said Lt. Gov. David Toland, who also serves as secretary of the state Department of Commerce.
Trisha Purdon, director of the Office of Rural Prosperity, said the grant program supported 12 mural projects in 2024.
In 2025, she said, the maximum grant award would be $7,500 and would require a 100% match. One-fourth of the match must be in cash, but the remainder could be covered with in-kind contributions.

(Getty Images)Our law school prides itself on graduating “practice ready” attorneys, poised to zealously and ethically represent their clients. But in the first few months of this administration, the practice of law has changed in disturbing ways, and we struggle with how to explain this to our students. Lawyers take an oath to support the Constitution — yet all around us, lawyers are making a mockery of that oath.
Recently, the law firm Paul Weiss capitulated to Donald Trump in a way so brazen and self-defeating that it rattled even those of us already poised to expect cowardice from Big Law. Trump began his campaign of retribution against private law firms that represented clients adverse to him or his allies by revoking the firms’ security clearances and threatening to cancel their clients’ government contracts. A judge halted the first order, directed at the law firm Perkins Coie, stating that it was likely unconstitutional. Nonetheless, Trump then issued a nearly identical order targeting Paul Weiss, and instead of fighting it, Paul Weiss folded.
The firm agreed to give Trump sway over the recipients of $40 million in pro bono services, and, per Trump’s press release, “conduct a comprehensive audit of all its employment practices” and “not adopt, use, or pursue any DEI policies.” Most chillingly, Trump reported that Paul Weiss “acknowledged the wrongdoing” of former partner Mark Pomerantz, who had worked as a prosecutor in the Manhattan DA’s office on the Trump hush money case.
It is bad enough that Trump is waging this campaign of bald political retribution. It is a different kind of betrayal entirely that Paul Weiss capitulated, especially when the order is likely illegal. Like Skadden and Millbank, which recently negotiated similar deals, Paul Weiss probably believes it is saving its business, but who will employ lawyers in a society devoid of the rule of law?
Lawyers working in this administration would earn failing grades if they were our students. U.S District Court for the Western District of Washington Judge John Cougheneour, granting an injunction against the executive order purporting to end birthright citizenship, said: “Frankly, I have difficulty understanding how a member of the bar would state unequivocally that this is a constitutional order. It just boggles my mind.”
Lawyers appearing before U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Judge James Boasberg made representations about the expulsion of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador that the judge deemed “woefully inadequate.” Judge Boasberg has since faced baseless calls for impeachment.
These attacks on the legal profession, the judiciary, and the rule of law are escalating and relentless. Meanwhile, applications for law school are skyrocketing. We’d like to celebrate. Being a lawyer is a wonderful career, full of opportunities to help people and institutions, enable progress, and solve problems. But how can we defend our profession when so many attorneys are aiding this administration’s assault on the rule of law and enabling this constitutional crisis?
For solace, we look to lawyers who are still doing the right thing in the face of these attacks on our profession. Jenner & Block and WilmerHale have both filed suit against the executive orders targeted at them. Other Big Law associates have protested their firms’ silence in the face of Trump’s executive orders targeting firms. Attorneys remaining in the federal government continue to labor in service to the American people, even though Elon Musk and his allies are deriding them as deadweight and decimating their agencies. Others have taken the brave step of resigning when their ethics have been compromised.
Future lawyers have a role to play, too. Our first-year students are preparing their annual moot court arguments, and have practiced how to be persuasive without misleading the court. Upper-level students know to call out and correct the misinterpretation of legal authorities and the misstatement of facts. Outside the classroom, students have been working to connect immigrants to legal resources. Others have used their developing legal expertise to testify for the first time about legislation in the New Hampshire State House.
Our students are a credit to the future of our profession. No matter their political affiliation or philosophical differences, they will swear fealty to the Constitution. Shame on the lawyers currently making a mockery of that oath. The rest of us will continue to fight for the rule of law, because that’s what we promised to do.

Pat Proctor plans to file as a candidate for secretary of state — a post now held by GOP Secretary of State Scott Schwab.,"Rep. Pat Proctor, R-Leavenworth, said he would seek the Republican Party's nomination in 2026 for secretary of state. The job would be vacant assuming Secretary of State Scott Schwab runs for the GOP nomination for governor. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Rep. Pat Proctor, a retired U.S. Army officer who entered the Kansas Legislature in 2020, launched a campaign for the Republican nomination for secretary of state.
Proctor, of Leavenworth, serves as chairman of the Kansas House elections committee. If elected in November 2026, he would become the state’s top election administrator. The position would be open assuming Secretary of State Scott Schwab continued with a plan to seek the GOP nomination for governor.
Proctor has been among the Legislature’s advocates for election reform bills associated with President Donald Trump’s unproven assertion his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden was fraudulent. Schwab has generally welcomed modernization of state election law, but maintained Kansas elections were fair and secure.
Proctor, 53, announced his candidacy Thursday during an event at a restaurant in Leavenworth.
“Voter confidence that the results of our elections reflect their will is at the core of our form of government and our way of life,” Proctor said. “The best way to restore that confidence is to increase transparency and ensure that only citizens vote in Kansas’ elections.”
Proctor said he played a role in the process of making Kansas “the gold standard for safe and secure elections,” and would continue that work as secretary of state.
During the 2025 legislation session, he supported a bill eliminating the state’s three-day grace period for advance mail-in ballots. Gov. Laura Kelly vetoed the bill, because she felt it was important to count ballots postmarked by Election Day that arrived up to three days late through the U.S. Postal Service. Proctor was part of the House supermajority that voted to override the Democratic governor.
The voting rights organization Loud Light Civic Action recently released video of a private Zoom meeting last year in which Proctor vowed to push through a bill dropping the three-day grace period.
On the same call organized by House Majority Leader Chris Croft with Johnson County Republicans and invite-only guests, Proctor said he would prefer Kansas ended the practice of advance voting.
Proctor has taken a central role among Republicans as the Legislature worked to limit authority of the Kansas Governmental Ethics Commission to engage in inquiries of campaign finance violations and election misconduct. That legislative push coincided with the commission’s complex investigation of Republican legislators and campaign workers.
He endorsed Senate Bill 105, which became law without the Kelly’s signature, requiring a Kansas governor to appoint a person to fill vacancies in the offices of U.S. senator, state treasurer and commissioner of insurance from a list of names recommended by the Legislature. The power grab by the Legislature was crafted to prevent Kelly from appointing a Democrat to a vacancy after resignation of a Republican.
Proctor said Kelly unexpectedly signed Senate Bill 6 to forbid the state to take part in ranked-choice voting, which would allow voters to list their candidate preferences in order on the ballot. The process involved tabulating votes in multiple rounds with the elimination of the lowest vote-receiving candidate after each round until a candidate received a majority.
“I am pleasantly surprised that the governor signed SB6, a bill I carried to passage on the House floor to ban ranked-choice voting, into law,” Proctor said. “Nothing is more corrosive to voter confidence than a voting method that requires a two-page explainer to explain to voters.”
In 2023, Proctor was criticized by a Leavenworth family for publishing without permission in his political newsletter a photograph of an elementary school student’s drawing of a rainbow flag. Proctor alleged the drawing was evidence educators in schools were indoctrinating children on LGBTQ politics. Proctor asserted the artwork was part of a “radical, woke agenda.”
Proctor retired from the U.S. Army as a colonel following 25 years of military service that coincided with wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Kelly Ayotte speaks with reporters on Election Day, Nov. 5, 2024. (Photo by Will Steinfeld/New Hampshire Bulletin)Public safety and corporate accountability must be at the top of the list for our next attorney general. John Formella is our attorney general now and his term ends soon. Gov. Kelly Ayotte will nominate a successor for confirmation by the Executive Council; her pick should be someone for whom accountability on the costs of climate change is a priority.
We can thank Formella for holding opioid manufacturers accountable and winning a $40 million settlement to the public benefit of New Hampshire. Quite rightly, his lawsuit called out the manufacturer for creating a public nuisance that interfered with public health and safety. The lawsuit also claimed the manufacturer deceived the public by misrepresenting the safety of its products.
Deception and risks to the public were central to New Hampshire’s 2003 lawsuit against Exxon and other fossil fuel manufacturers over an additive in gasoline, and cited negligence and failure to provide adequate warnings regarding dangers associated with their product. After a decade of litigation, several New Hampshire attorneys general (Ayotte among them) and a three-month-long trial in 2013, the jury needed less than two hours to arrive at a guilty verdict. Exxon paid New Hampshire $236 million; the award is being used today for projects related to cleaning up and protecting drinking water. 
These two lawsuits illustrate New Hampshire at its best: serving under parens patriae, the principle that the state carries with it the responsibility for the protection of its citizens. New Hampshire can rely on this principle to sue fossil fuel companies for their role in climate change. 
Science has determined the causes of climate change. The evidence illustrates that Exxon’s own scientists understood the link between burning fossil fuels and global warming as far back as 1977. Yet Exxon’s leadership chose not to confront the challenge, but instead chose to deny, deceive, and delay, and reap hundreds of billions of dollars in profits. The paper trail is there for all to see.  
Peer-reviewed science has also determined with some precision the role fossil fuel companies have played in contributing to climate change. Published science finds that heat-trapping emissions traced to the world’s largest fossil fuel producers have contributed to nearly half of the rise in temperature and nearly one-third of the observed sea level rise.  
Science now plays a key role in litigation. Today over 30 U.S. cities, counties, and states are suing to hold accountable Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, and others to pay their fair share of the costs of climate change. 
Five New England states are suing fossil fuel companies using various consumer protection laws related to consumer fraud, deception, and damages. Climate impacts ignore political borders; it is time for New Hampshire to join Maine, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont. 
Gov. Ayotte’s positions on clean energy and climate have evolved in the right direction since she was our attorney general. As a U.S. senator, Ayotte listened to businesses and scientists. In 2015, in supporting the U.S. EPA’s plan to reduce carbon pollution, Sen. Ayotte explained, “I have decided to support the Clean Power Plan to address climate change through clean energy solutions that will protect our environment.”  
Addressing climate change will protect the environment and businesses, and business leaders in New Hampshire know this. Here are a few comments from a private meeting of 100 business leaders convened in 2014 to address risk and resilience and a changing climate:

“We seem to be getting into a period of climate that some of these storms will not have easy fixes.” — Technology provider
“I had three 100-year storms in five years. Where do you go with that?”— Utility official
“These major storms shut down trucking to various parts of the state and shut down commerce.” — Manufacturer
“Our cost to maintain roads in the woods has about doubled and are today unpredictable.” — Forest products supplier
“Property insurance is increasingly difficult to get on coastlines and you’re going to have to deal with that.” — Financial adviser

The costs to businesses and schools, to towns and cities, to residents and to public health are becoming overwhelming. An expensive new bridge spanning Hampton Harbor is designed for 4 feet of sea level rise; crop losses and washed-out roads occur in every county. Our taxes are already paying for mitigation and repair. It is time for New Hampshire to protect its citizens once again. 
Holding fossil fuel companies accountable for climate damages is consistent with the legal doctrines New Hampshire has relied on in the recent past against opioid manufacturers and polluters. Holding fossil fuel companies accountable needs to be on the short list for the next attorney general, and through her consideration and subsequent nomination Gov. Ayotte has a generational opportunity to make that happen.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ayotteshadows-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-04 12:23:21.259606

President Donald Trump unveiled a sweeping new tariff plan on April 2, 2025, to reshape U.S. trade and boost domestic industry. 
Framing the announcement as “Liberation Day,” he proposed a 10% tariff on essentially all imports, with steeper rates for major trade partners, including 34% on Chinese goods and 20% on those from the European Union. Starting April 3, a 25% tariff on all foreign-made cars and auto parts will take effect – a move that he says will revive U.S. manufacturing and reset America’s trade agenda.
But the fanfare surrounding the announcement masks a much larger gamble. What’s really at stake is trust – America’s long-standing reputation as a stable and predictable destination for global investment. And once that trust is lost, it’s incredibly hard to win back.
The strategy is presented as a robust defense of American manufacturing and the middle class. But foreign direct investment – when overseas companies build factories or expand operations in the U.S. – depends on more than just opportunity. It depends on certainty.
If global investors start to worry that U.S. trade policy can shift abruptly, they may relocate their capital elsewhere. As such, the administration’s aggressive approach to tariffs risks undermining the very confidence that has long made the U.S. a top destination for global capital.
 Auto tariffs as a case in point

Nowhere is this risk more visible than in the auto industry.
In 2023 alone, the United States attracted over US$148 billion in foreign direct investment, with nearly $42.9 billion tied to manufacturing, including in the automotive sector. Over the past few decades, major global automakers such as Toyota, BMW and Hyundai have established expansive plants in states including Alabama, Ohio and Kentucky.
These facilities – many of which have seen significant reinvestment and expansion in recent years, especially in response to the shift toward electric vehicles – employ thousands of Americans and contribute significantly to local economies.
Trump’s tariff push aims to get automakers to manufacture more vehicles on U.S. soil to overcome rising import costs. It’s a strategy with precedent. During his first term, the threat of auto tariffs, alongside existing plans, helped spur Toyota’s $1.6 billion investment in a North Carolina plant and Volkswagen’s expansion of its operations in Tennessee. It’s not far-fetched to imagine Honda or Mercedes following suit with new factories in Indiana or Texas.
But here’s the catch: “Made in the USA” doesn’t always mean “made for less.” American auto plants often face productivity and efficiency gaps compared with foreign competitors. Labor costs are higher. Assembly lines move more slowly, partly due to stricter labor protections, less automation and aging infrastructure. And U.S. automakers such as Ford and GM still depend heavily on global supply chains. Even for vehicles assembled in America, about 40% of the parts, such as engines from Canada and wiring harnesses from Mexico, are imported.
When those parts are taxed, production costs go up. Moody’s estimates that pickups such as the Ford F-150 and Chevy Silverado could cost $2,000 to $3,000 more as a result. Goldman Sachs projects price hikes of up to $15,000, depending on the vehicle. Automakers then face a dilemma: raise prices and risk losing customers or absorb the costs and cut into their margins.
 A ripple effect across the economy

Tariffs may protect one industry, but their ripple effects reach much further. They raise costs for other sectors that rely on imported inputs, slow down production by making supply chains more expensive and less efficient, squeeze profit margins, and leave businesses and consumers with harder choices.
Factories represent billion-dollar investments that take years to recoup their costs. Mixed signals, such as the president calling tariffs “permanent” one moment and negotiable the next, create a climate of uncertainty. That makes companies more hesitant to build, hire and expand.
And investors are watching closely. If building in the U.S. becomes more expensive and less predictable, is it still a smart long-term bet? When a company is deciding where to build its next battery plant or chip facility, volatility in U.S. policy can be a deal breaker.
The consequences could surface soon. Goldman Sachs has already lowered its 2025 U.S. GDP growth forecast to 1.7%, down from an earlier 2.2%, citing the administration’s trade policy risks. Consumers, still grappling with inflation and high interest rates, may begin to delay big-ticket purchases, especially as tariffs push prices even higher.
 The international fallout

America’s trading partners aren’t standing still. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says his country “will fight back – with purpose and with force.” The European Union is exploring duties on American tech firms. Japan, a longtime ally, is signaling unease. If these countries redirect investment to other countries, the U.S. could lose its competitive edge for years to come.
And while roughly 1 million Americans work in the auto manufacturing industry, more than 150 million make up the total American labor force. When tariffs drive up input costs, it can trigger a chain reaction, hurting retailers, stalling service-sector jobs and slowing overall economic growth.
Consumers will feel it too. Higher prices mean lower sales, reduced tax revenues and shrinking profits. All of that weakens the economy at a time when household budgets are already strained.
 Lessons from history

The U.S. has seen how trade policy can shape investment decisions – just in reverse. In the 1980s, Japanese automakers responded to U.S. import quotas not by withdrawing but by building plants in the United States. That response was possible because policies were clear and negotiated, not abrupt or adversarial.
Today, the story is different. Volatile, unilateral tariffs don’t build trust – they erode it. And when trust erodes, so does investment.
Yes, a factory in Indiana or Kentucky might reopen. Yet if that comes at the cost of deterring billions of dollars in long-term investment, is it worth it?
So while the president may celebrate April 2 as Liberation Day, markets may come to see it as the tipping point – when global confidence in the U.S. economy began to falter in earnest.

(Photo by Lance Cheung/U.S. Department of Agriculture)Veterinary experts nationwide have a variety of hypotheses for new and puzzling test results from cow milk being analyzed for avian influenza.
March marked one year since officials first reported Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza — H5N1 — among dairy cattle. Since then, bird flu has infected 996 herds across the country, including 19 cases in the last month in California and Idaho.
New Mexico reported nine dairy herds in Curry County tested positive last April, and began milk testing its cattle in February following the rollout of a federal program.
The most recent results from milk-testing programs revealed that while more than 95% of the 93 cow herds in the state tested negative, a small set of inconsistent positives — all from three Curry County herds infected last year — remain, according to New Mexico State Veterinarian Samantha Holeck.
Enter the mystery: The cows themselves do not test positive, nor do they demonstrate the symptoms documented in the earlier avian flu outbreak, she said, such as huge drops in milk production.
“It’s been a real challenge to try to understand how it continues to circulate in some of these herds,” Holeck said.
New Mexico is partnering up with veterinarians in the U.S. Department of Agriculture to research the viral fragments found in the milk and sent samples to the federal National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa.
“I know we’re a year into this situation now,” Holeck said, “but it seems like there’s still just so much to try to understand.”
New Mexico isn’t alone in experiencing the viral fragments, said Michael Payne, a food animal veterinarian at University of California, Davis, who noted there have been reports of similar persistent positives in quarantined herds there.
“I wouldn’t diminish the importance of it being small,” Payne said. “Yes, we’re talking about low levels of virus and yes, we’re talking about cows not getting sick, but it’s important that we’re not exactly sure where it’s coming from, and that in and of itself merits examination.”
He said more than $2 million dollars of research is being conducted in California on avian flu transmission across a dozen projects; including examining if it’s transmitted by flies; blowing in from dust storms; or carried by birds outside of waterfowl.
“It will be critical that we figure out how the disease is moving and how it’s changing,” Payne said.
‘Science is still very much in its infancy’
While scientists need to perform more research, Payne posited some possibilities for the detection of viral fragments: they could signify a different and less potent version of the virus; cooler weather might allow more viral fragments to survive in the bulk tanks, compared to the triple-digit temperatures in the fall; cows may have developed “herd immunity” against the virus.
“It could be that much smaller numbers of cattle are being exposed and are becoming infected, which has resulted in a much, much lower level of virus that’s being detected inside the bulk tanks,” Payne said. “It’s an area of active research.”
Veterinarian Andrew Bowman, a molecular epidemiologist at Ohio State University, said laboratory tests’ sensitivity could also be a factor: They may be picking up positives from environmental contamination in the tanks or on the farms.
“It doesn’t take much; we’re talking a few copies of the viral genome to be present in a sample to send it positive,” Bowman said. “We can pick up a positive that’s likely not a viable virus.”
Since the development of HPAI in cows is so new, as is the method of transmission — where the virus replicates in the mammary glands that produce milk — he said the basic questions of the interactions between the virus, the host and the environment still need answers.
“Science is still very much in the infancy of what we know about avian influenza in cattle,” Bowman said.
Offering reassurances
While scientists say it’s important to unravel the mystery of the viral fragments to better understand how the virus might change or spread in dairy cows, they also emphasize that risk to the public from avian influenza remains low.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports transmission of avian flu can occur from contact with milk from infected cows; eating, drinking or inhaling droplets contaminated with live virus; touching the live or dead bodies of infected animals. Thus far, the CDC has no documented human-to-human transmission. As of April 1, 70 people had contracted H5N1, mostly California farmworkers.
Most milk sold in the U.S. is heated to a temperature to kill bacteria and viruses, called pasteurization. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration tested milk products in 17 states and, finding no live viruses, reported that “pasteurization is effective at inactivating H5N1, and that the commercial, pasteurized milk supply is safe.”
Federal officials, however, warn that unpasteurized milk, also called raw milk, is unsafe to drink. Research from the National Institutes of Health in June using infected raw milk from New Mexico found that the H5N1 virus had survived for at least five weeks in refrigerated conditions. Further, mice that consumed the raw milk showed signs of illness, which researchers suggest indicates drinking raw milk can transmit the virus to other organisms.
Holeck emphasized that New Mexico milk is safe.
“For dairies, it’s standard routine if they have sick cows for any reason, not just [avian flu], that milk is always diverted out from the milk supply, it doesn’t enter commerce,” she said.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dairy-cows-USDA-photo-by-Lance-Cheung-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-04 11:09:16.864129

Larry Rhoden speaks to reporters during a press conference on March 31, 2025, at the state Capitol in Pierre. (Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)During the recently completed legislative session, there were a couple of discussions in a House State Affairs Committee meeting that may have a direct bearing on South Dakota’s future.
One topic was what to call a tax that has never before been implemented. At issue was House Bill 1138 which would have created a tax on advertising with the revenue to be used for property tax relief. Currently advertising is exempt from taxation.
Sen. Taffy Howard, a Rapid City Republican and a sponsor of the legislation, looked into the future and saw that opponents of the bill would call it a new tax. Howard testified that she preferred to call it a “tax shift” that was undoing an earlier tax shift that put the advertising tax on the exempt list.
Howard’s prediction was correct as Steve Willard, president of the South Dakota Broadcasters Association, said it was a new tax since no one has ever had to pay it. “It’s brand new to them,” Willard said of the advertisers who would have to pay the tax. “They went from not having one to having one, which to me seems new.”
Governor proposes county sales tax option to reduce residential property taxes

The other discussion came just prior to the vote on the bill, while committee members listed their reasons for voting against it. Never mind that no other state in the union has a tax on advertising or that implementing the tax would certainly mean adding more personnel to the Department of Revenue. Lawmakers didn’t seem put off by the constitutional argument that a tax on advertising is a tax on free speech.
What put them off was that they had not yet given enough consideration to making budget cuts. Rep. Bethany Soye, a Sioux Falls Republican, said legislators had two choices when it came to property tax relief: cut spending or increase taxes. If lawmakers insisted that taxes shouldn’t go up, Soye said, then there needed to be cuts made.
Her thoughts were echoed by Rep. Jon Hansen, a Dell Rapid Republican who serves as speaker of the House. Hansen said the driver behind high property taxes was excessive growth in government and excessive spending. “We owe it to the people to look first to the cuts,” Hansen said.
This conversation reflected comments made later in the session by House Majority Leader Scott Odenbach, who said that property taxes were too high due to excessive spending by counties and schools.
In a South Dakota Searchlight story the Spearfish Republican said, “You’re not going to get property tax relief until you look at the spending done by our public school system and our counties, because that’s where local property taxes go.”
The story noted that this was a change in tone for lawmakers who, two years ago, conducted a summer study about ways to help cash-strapped counties. After the summer study, the Legislature spent $10 million to help local governments with cybersecurity and the cost to counties for public defenders or court-appointed attorneys.
These conversations point to a hard road ahead for Gov. Larry Rhoden, who proposed an optional half-percent county sales tax with the revenue to be used for reducing property taxes for homeowners.

Rhoden has already shepherded a property tax bill through the Legislature. The multifaceted law includes temporary caps on countywide increases in residential assessments, and on the amount local governments can grow their property tax collections based on new construction. By choosing a cap rather than budget cuts, and now by offering counties a sales tax, Rhoden has cast himself as a leader who would rather not disrupt county and school budgets.
Like Howard and her “tax shift” advertising tax, Rhoden is seeking a way to explain his proposal that doesn’t include the words “new tax.” Like Howard, he’s struggling. In a South Dakota Searchlight story, the governor said tourists were likely to pay some of the county sales tax. “Realistically, it’s a tax decrease for the citizens of the state,” Rhoden claimed. Only in the world of politics does a new tax equal a “tax decrease.”
However Rhoden explains his county sales tax for property tax relief, he’s certain to run up against a budget-cutting crowd of lawmakers who believe that counties and schools aren’t doing enough to restrain spending.
Rhoden has shown real political skill during his short time as governor, including his successful effort to get his property tax bill through a crowded field of competing legislation. Let’s see if those skills can handle selling a new revenue source for counties to tax-shy, budget-cutting Republican lawmakers.

In January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order pausing federal grants and loans, alarming HBCUs, where most students rely on Pell Grants or federal aid. The order was later rescinded, but ongoing cuts leave key support systems in political limbo, said Denise Smith, deputy director of higher education policy and a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a left-leaning think tank.
Leaders worry about Trump’s rollback of the Justice40 Initiative, a climate change program that relied on HBCUs to tackle environmental justice issues, she said. And there’s uncertainty around programs such as federal work-study and TRIO, which provides college access services to disadvantaged students.
“People are being mum because we’re starting to see a chilling effect,” Smith said. “There’s real fear that resources could be lost at any moment — even the ones schools already know they need to survive.”
Most students at HBCUs rely on Pell Grants or other federal aid, and a fifth of Black college graduates matriculate from HBCUs. Other minority-serving institutions, known as MSIs, that focus on Hispanic and American Indian populations also heavily depend on federal aid.
“It’s still unclear what these cuts will mean for HBCUs and MSIs, even though they’re supposedly protected,” Smith said.
States may be unlikely to make up any potential federal funding cuts to their public HBCUs. And the schools already have been underfunded by states compared with predominantly white schools.

Congress created public, land-grant universities under the Morrill Act of 1862 to serve the country’s agricultural and industrial industries, providing 10 million acres taken from tribes and offering it for public universities such as Auburn and the University of Georgia. But Black students were excluded.
The 1890 Morrill Act required states to either integrate or establish separate land-grant institutions for Black students — leading to the creation of many HBCUs. These schools have since faced chronic underfunding compared with their majority-white counterparts.
 ‘None of them are equitable’

In 2020, the average endowment of white land-grant universities was $1.9 billion, compared with just $34 million for HBCUs, according to Forbes.
There are other HBCUs that don’t stem from the 1890 law, including well-known private schools such as Fisk University, Howard University, Morehouse College and Spelman College. But more than three-fourths of HBCU students attend public universities, meaning state lawmakers play a significant role in their funding and oversight.
Marybeth Gasman, an endowed chair in education and a distinguished professor at Rutgers University, isn’t impressed by what states have done for HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions so far. She said she isn’t sure there is a state model that can bridge the massive funding inequities for these institutions, even in states better known for their support.
“I don’t think North Carolina or Maryland have done a particularly good job at the state level. Nor have any of the other states. Students at HBCUs are funded at roughly 50-60% of what students at [predominately white institutions] are funded. That’s not right,” said Gasman.
“Most of the bipartisan support has come from the U.S. Congress and is the result of important work by HBCUs and affiliated organizations. I don’t know of a state model that works well, as none of them are equitable.”
Under federal law, states that accept federal land-grant funding are required to match every dollar with state funds.
But in 2023, the Biden administration sent letters to 16 governors warning them that their public Black land-grant institutions had been underfunded by more than $12 billion over three decades.
Tennessee State University alone had a $2.1 billion gap with the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
At a February meeting hosted by the Tennessee Black Caucus of State Legislators, Tennessee State interim President Dwayne Tucker said the school is focused on asking lawmakers this year for money to keep the school running.
Otherwise, Tucker said at the time, the institution could run out of cash around April or May.
“That’s real money. That’s the money we should work on,” Tucker said, according to a video of the forum.
In some states, lawsuits to recoup long-standing underfunding have been one course of action.
In Maryland, a landmark $577 million legal settlement was reached in 2021 to address decades of underfunding at four public HBCUs.
In Georgia, three HBCU students sued the state in 2023 for underfunding of three HBCUs.
In Tennessee, a recent state report found Tennessee State University has been shortchanged roughly $150 million to $544 million over the past 100 years.
But Tucker said he thinks filing a lawsuit doesn’t make much sense for Tennessee State.
“There’s no account payable set up with the state of Tennessee to pay us $2.1 billion,” Tucker said at the February forum. “And if we want to make a conclusion about whether [that money] is real or not … you’re going to have to sue the state of Tennessee, and I don’t think that makes a whole lot of sense.”
 Economic anchors

There are 102 HBCUs across 19 states, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands, though a large number of HBCUs are concentrated in the South.
Alabama has the most, with 14, and Pennsylvania has the farthest north HBCU.
Beyond education, HBCUs contribute roughly $15 billion annually to their local economies, generate more than 134,000 jobs and create $46.8 billion in career earnings, proving themselves to be economic anchors in under-resourced regions.
Homecoming events at HBCUs significantly bolster local economies, local studies show. North Carolina Central University’s homecoming contributes approximately $2.5 million to Durham’s economy annually.
Similarly, Hampton University’s 2024 homecoming was projected to inject around $3 million into the City of Hampton and the coastal Virginia region, spurred by increased visitor spending and retail sales. In Tallahassee, Florida A&M University’s 2024 homecoming week in October generated about $5.1 million from Sunday to Thursday.
Their significance is especially pronounced in Southern states — such as North Carolina, where HBCUs account for just 16% of four-year schools but serve 45% of the state’s Black undergraduate population.
Smith has been encouraged by what she’s seen in states such as Maryland, North Carolina and Tennessee, which have a combined 20 HBCUs among them. Lawmakers have taken piecemeal steps to expand support for HBCUs through policy and funding, she noted.
Tennessee became the first state in 2018 to appoint a full-time statewide higher education official dedicated to HBCU success for institutions such as Fisk and Tennessee State. Meanwhile, North Carolina launched a bipartisan, bicameral HBCU Caucus in 2023 to advocate for its 10 HBCUs, known as the NC10, and spotlight their $1.7 billion annual economic impact.
“We created a bipartisan HBCU caucus because we needed people in both parties to understand these institutions’ importance. If you represent a district with an HBCU, you should be connected to it,” said North Carolina Democratic Sen. Gladys Robinson, an alum of private HBCU Bennett College and state HBCU North Carolina A&T State University.
“It took constant education — getting folks to come and see, talk about what was going on,” she recalled. “It’s like beating the drum constantly until you finally hear the beat.”
For Robinson, advocacy for HBCUs can be a tough task, especially when fellow lawmakers aren’t aware of the stories of these institutions. North Carolina A&T was among the 1890 land-grant universities historically undermatched in federal agricultural and extension funding.
The NC Promise Tuition Plan, launched in 2018, reduced in-state tuition to $500 per semester and out-of-state tuition to $2,500 per semester at a handful of schools that now include HBCUs Elizabeth City State University and Fayetteville State University; Western Carolina University, a Hispanic-serving institution; and UNC at Pembroke, founded in 1887 to serve American Indians.
Through conversations on the floor of the General Assembly, and with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, Robinson advocated to ensure Elizabeth City State — a struggling HBCU — was included, which helped revive enrollment and public investment.
“I’m hopeful because we’ve been here before,” Robinson said in an interview.
“These institutions were built out of churches and land by people who had nothing, just so we could be educated,” Robinson said. “We have people in powerful positions across the country. We have to use our strength and our voices. Alumni must step up.
“It’s tough, but not undoable.”
Meanwhile, other states are working to recognize certain colleges that offer significant support to Black college students. California last year passed a law creating a Black-serving Institution designation, the first such title in the country. Schools must have programs focused on Black achievement, retention and graduation rates, along with a five-year plan to improve them. Sacramento State is among the first receiving the designation.
And this session, California state Assemblymember Mike Gipson, a Democrat, introduced legislation that proposes a $75 million grant program to support Black and underserved students over five years through the Designation of California Black-Serving Institutions Grant Program. The bill was most recently referred to the Assembly’s appropriations committee.

(Helaina Thompson/Courtesy of Over the Moon Farm)Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
A mixed response from the states
The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.
“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
Creating a new food system
In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

(Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — With gender-affirming care for minors now banned in Kansas, the weight of their transgender care falls largely on mental health providers.
Providers at Interpersonal Psychiatry in Lawrence say the new Kansas law coupled with national anti-trans efforts by President Donald Trump paint a grim picture for the next four years.
Ruby Mae Johnson, CEO of Interpersonal Psychiatry, said the practice is expecting an influx of therapy appointments for LGBTQ+ patients, especially transgender patients.
“Everybody I know in the trans community in particular has, if they have access to it, increased their own therapy,” Johnson said. “As a transgender woman myself, I’m feeling empathy. I’m feeling the same things that our patients are feeling. There’s simply just a lot of fear — not just about what’s in the statute, but what it might signal going forward.”
Senate Bill 63 bans gender-affirming puberty blockers, hormone therapies or surgeries for minors. State employees are not allowed to “promote” social transitioning or gender-affirming medical care.
Interpersonal Psychiatry is a private practice and doesn’t receive any state funding. Johnson expects more transgender minors in Kansas to look at private mental health practices for care, because she sees state-funded practices as vulnerable to funding cuts or future bans.
“That’s going to increase the need for services, and more costly interventions, too,” Johnson said. “Without support, people will die. This will cost lives. We know that one of the surest ways to prevent death by suicide among queer youth in general and transgender youth specifically, is simply to support and acknowledge who they are. And when the political fabric of the state or the country is dedicating a pretty significant amount of energy to saying, ‘No, you’re not that person,’ that’s going to cost lives.”

Emily Feingold is a therapist at Interpersonal Psychiatry. She says that while the new law will have detrimental mental health effects on the LGBTQ+ population, it lacks “teeth.”
The law outlines repercussions for medical providers who provide gender-affirming care, but Feingold says nobody can police what a therapist talks to their client about.
“Nobody is controlling what I do with my clients. And in terms of insurance coverage, it all has to do with what I write in my notes. I’m going to continue to meet the needs of my clients,” Feingold said.
Feingold said while she’s no longer allowed to recommend medical care, the symptoms of gender dysphoria still exist.
“Instead of treating these kids with hormones, we’re going to treat them with psychotropic meds,” Feingold said. “Do we want that? Is that better? We’re just kicking the can farther down the road, because that person’s gender identity is not going to change.”
Johnson said trans kids will deal with the impact for the rest of their lives: “It sucks to have never looked in the mirror and seen a young woman.”
The law was passed after a years-long effort as a result of the expanded Republican supermajority. After Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly vetoed it, her veto was overridden 85-34 in the House and 31-9 in the Senate.
Rep. Mark Schreiber of Emporia was the only Republican who supported Kelly’s veto. Schreiber’s daughter was born with birth defects, and while she’s not transgender, Schreiber said he empathized with parents of transgender minors.
“A parent that has a child that needs specialized care of any kind will go to great lengths to see that the child gets that care, whether it’s physical, mental, whatever it might be,” Schreiber said. “I don’t think trans kids are any different than our daughter.”
Schreiber voted against the law when it first came to the House floor, then again in support of Kelly’s veto. Schreiber said that after his first vote, he heard feedback from Kansans.
“The first thing that they conveyed to me was fear that they’re not going to be able to provide care for their child,” Schreiber said. “As a parent of a child that had major medical difficulties, I cannot fathom that.”
Wichita Republican Sen. Renee Erickson, who introduced the bill, told Kansas Reflector she’s “not interested in talking to anyone” about the law.
In 2023, Erickson supported Senate Bill 180 — which defines a person’s gender as “biological sex, either male or female, at birth.” She also championed legislation that banned transgender athletes from school sports, and a proposed law this year that would police the use of preferred pronouns in schools.
The city of Lawrence responded to attacks on the transgender community by passing an ordinance declaring Lawrence as a transgender safe haven. Johnson, the Interpersonal Psychiatry CEO, testified in support of the ordinance, crediting the Lawrence community with providing a space comfortable for her transition.
After the 2024 presidential election, Johnson worried her gender identity would make Interpersonal Psychiatry a target. She considered leaving the country but decided to stay — in large part because of the LGBTQ+ community in Lawrence.
“We have always been committed to the LGBT+ population,” Johnson said. “We are just going to double down on our commitment to show up for our communities.”
The practice sponsored an LGBTQ+ prom, and Johnson is running for Lawrence City Commission.
“I won’t say it gets better, because I never tell anybody that anything will be OK — because I don’t know. But I will say, we’re all here,” Johnson said. “We’ve got your back.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ruby-and-Emily-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-04 10:04:41.823180

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska House of Representatives on Thursday approved a bill that seeks to solve a nearly $200 million state budget deficit, but legislators failed to approve spending from a state savings account, something needed to fix the deficit.
House Bill 56, which passed on a 21-19 vote, is a “fast-track supplemental” budget bill designed to address the current fiscal year, which ends June 30.
Because of lower-than-expected oil prices and higher-than-expected costs, there isn’t enough money in the budget to pay for spending through the end of the year. That’s caused lawmakers to turn to the Constitutional Budget Reserve, the state’s principal savings account.
“The vote we’re taking today is just about paying for what we’ve already authorized,” said Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage and co-chair of the House Finance Committee, before the vote. “These items we’ve already authorized are for these immediate-term priorities like disaster relief, fire protection and ongoing lawsuits that were brought to us by the governor.”
Spending from the reserve requires three-quarters of the 40-person House and three-quarters of the 20-person Senate, plus the assent of the governor.
But on Thursday, only 21 members of the House voted in favor of the clause that unlocks the budget reserve. All of the “no” votes came from members of the House’s Republican minority caucus. All of the “yes” votes came from the House’s multipartisan majority.
If the bill fails to pass the Legislature, Gov. Mike Dunleavy would be forced to make unilateral cuts to the state budget, impounding funding for various programs.
For the moment, that’s a distant prospect.
Despite the failed budget reserve vote, HB 56 will advance to the Senate — 21 votes is the minimum needed to advance a bill from the House to the Senate — but the failed vote means that the House will need to revote on the budget reserve clause once the Senate acts.
“We’re still early in the process,” said House Minority Leader Mia Costello, R-Anchorage.
Historically, members of the House minority have withheld support for the CBR vote until after the Senate approves the bill.
By waiting, the minority preserves its negotiating leverage, Costello said. That makes it less likely that minority-opposed provisions will be added to the bill.
In addition, it’s possible that the fast-track budget bill will later be combined with the budget bill for the next fiscal year, which starts July 1. So-called “turducken” budget bills have previously included one budget reserve vote for both fiscal years.
Rep. Kevin McCabe, R-Big Lake and a member of the minority caucus, said before Thursday’s vote that the fast-track bill lacks minority input and that as a result, he could not support it. 
As currently written, the bill would use savings to pay for more than $111 million in previously unforeseen spending, including millions for wildfire response, Medicaid and disaster aid. Those additions were requested by the governor to meet state needs. 
One late-adopted amendment, approved Thursday by the House, restored a funding request for village public safety officers, who serve a police and lifesaving role in rural Alaska communities.
On top of the additional spending, revenue is down about $80 million from what had been expected last year. 
The Senate Finance Committee has already scheduled hearings for HB 56, indicating that it may move quickly toward a vote of the full Senate.
Even if the fast-track supplemental budget is adopted in time, lawmakers still must resolve an expected deficit in the 2026 fiscal year, which starts July 1. The House is expected to begin debate on a budget bill for that fiscal year next week.

Compared to last year, DCNR reports a nearly 30% increase in campsite reservations for the summer. As of March 31, 24% of campsites for the state’s 124 parks and 20 forests have already been reserved for its “peak season” between Memorial Day and Labor Day.
“Pennsylvanians and visitors alike are embracing the outdoors like never before,” said DCNR Secretary Cindy Adams Dunn. “With increased demand for camping, we encourage everyone to plan ahead and take advantage of the many beautiful sites still available.”
DCNR also cites some federal campgrounds closing  due to staffing shortages as one reason behind the boost in campsite reservations.

Prince Gallitzin, Bald Eagle, Greenwood Furnace, and Trough Creek state parks are currently the most popular locations with large lakes for boating, fishing, and swimming. Trough Creek, located in Huntingdon County, saw the largest increase with a 189% boost in reservations in March 2025 in comparison to the same time last year, according to DCNR.
In February, the Trump administration fired approximately 1,000 newly hired National Park Service employees as a result of efforts from the Department of Government Efficiency.
All state parks in Pennsylvania offer free entrance year round.
In an effort to promote camping in the state, DCNR has also relaunched its gift certificate program, which can be used for reservations on campsites, cabins, picnic pavilions, and state-operated retail purchases. DCNR’s website also provides a calendar of events on public lands. 
Reservations can be made for campsites and lodging at visitPAparks.com or by calling 888-PA-PARKS (888-727-2757), Monday through Saturday, 7:00 AM – 5:00 PM.

(George Frey/Getty Images)Lawmakers were split on what to do with a proposal to ban the possession of large-capacity magazines, defined as having more than 10 rounds of ammunition. 
During a work session Thursday evening, Rep. David Sinclair (D-Bath) asked the bill sponsor if it would defeat the intent of the bill to focus on the trafficking of those magazines and increase the limit to 20 rounds, rather than criminalize possession.
“Instead of making the substantial progress I would hope to make with the bill, that would be incremental progress,” said Rep. Matthew Beck (D-South Portland), who introduced LD 1109 to address what he described as a “common denominator” among many of the deadliest mass shootings. 
The Legislature’s Judiciary Committee was divided on the bill, with seven members voting against it, including two Democrats, and five supporting amended versions. Two members were absent for the vote. 
The majority of Democrats on the committee were split between Sinclair’s proposal to focus on trafficking and an amendment from committee co-chair Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland) to mimic Vermont law by limiting magazines to 10 rounds for long guns and 15 for handguns. Carney’s changes would also provide a way to grandfather in magazines people already lawfully own. 
Beck’s version of the bill would apply retroactively to magazines people currently own and give them 180 days to dispose of or alter them to meet the new requirements. 
In response to questions about how the state would determine which guns would be grandfathered in, Carney added language requiring Maine State Police to develop a process. Two other Democrats joined Carney on her amended proposal. 
While Carney said she is sympathetic to the concerns about criminalizing items people purchased legally, Rep. Jennifer Poirier (R-Skowhegan) criticized the bill for penalizing law-abiding citizens. She argued that people with ill intent will find a way to possess illegal firearms, regardless of what laws are on the books. 
Rep. Dylan Pugh (D-Portland), who was the only member to back the amendment proposed by Sinclair, pushed back on the argument that focusing on trafficking wouldn’t stop mass shootings and said that criminalizing guns that people already own would be an overly-broad encroachment of one’s rights. 
The committee also worked on bills related to the definition of machine guns and requiring serial numbers on ghost guns, but those were tabled for further discussion without a vote.

About 200 people turned out in rainy weather to rally outside UPMC headquarters in downtown Pittsburgh Thursday evening. Standing under rainbow umbrellas and waving trans pride flags, they rebuked the health care giant for rolling back young people’s access to gender-affirming care.
Advocacy groups including TransYOUniting, the Pennsylvania Youth Congress and others organized the action after learning that UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh had stopped providing gender-affirming health services to LGBTQ+ kids. They viewed the move as a capitulation to the Trump administration’s plan to exclude trans people from public life.
Several children were in attendance, including Oliver, 10, of Lawrenceville who waved a “Protect Trans Kids” sign while chanting slogans with the crowd. “I’m mad because I’m transgender,” they said.
PublicSource is withholding Oliver’s last name at the request of their parent, K.T. Fishbein, an echocardiographer at Children’s Hospital. Like most trans and nonbinary children, Oliver isn’t seeking gender-affirming care yet. But Fishbein “was pretty upset” by their employer’s decision to deny care to the children who need it, and worries that Oliver and others may not have access in the future.
“I love what I do at Children’s. I love my community there,” Fishbein said. “But this makes you feel really let down.”

During the rally, organizers attempted to deliver a letter signed by Mayor Ed Gainey and 14 other state and local officials to UPMC leadership. It wasn’t accepted, but it called on the executives to:

Immediately restore access to gender-affirming care at Children’s Hospital
Establish an advisory committee that includes trans youth to oversee administration of care
Fund alternative providers if a court order bars it from providing gender-affirming care, among other demands.

“… You are choosing to send a devastating message to the entire trans community that their health and futures are negotiable under political pressure,” they wrote to UPMC executives. “Continuing to provide comparable medical care to cisgender young people but not transgender youth is discrimination.”
In a speech, Gainey told rallygoers to “stand up and force UPMC to do the right thing.” Asked if the city has the leverage to pressure UPMC to restore access to gender-affirming care, he wrote, “the City of Pittsburgh has laws on the books to ensure people have equal access to health care regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation.”
“My administration’s law department is examining legal avenues to enforce our city’s non-discrimination policies, and we expect health systems that operate here to follow the law,” he said in a statement to PublicSource after the rally.
Rallies were also held today in Erie, Altoona, Lancaster, and Lewisburg — all cities where UPMC operates.

In January, President Donald Trump issued an executive order that threatens to pull federal funding from hospitals, medical schools and other institutions that provide gender-affirming care to minors, which it defines as those under age 19. The order’s language specifically mentions puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgery — all of which are medically necessary for those who suffer from gender dysphoria, according to a consensus among major medical associations.
A federal judge in Maryland extended a nationwide injunction last month that blocks enforcement of the order. The White House didn’t immediately respond to a question about its compliance with the court, though it said in February that the order is “already having its intended effect.” The statement listed six hospitals, including one in Philadelphia, that were pausing or reviewing gender-affirming services for minors.
Some large health systems quickly bent to the pressure and began turning young LGBTQ+ patients away just days after Trump signed the executive order. UPMC may have waited longer before quietly changing its policies around gender-affirming care for minors. Patients and their families told reporters last month that its providers had stopped prescribing puberty blockers and hormones. And it canceled an 18-year-old’s top surgery, which was scheduled for March 24.

A spokesperson wrote that UPMC is monitoring federal directives that affect its ability to provide “specific types of care” to patients under 19. “We continue to offer necessary behavioral health and other support within the bounds of the law. We empathize with the patients and families who are directly affected by these ongoing changes.”
The spokesperson didn’t answer detailed questions about UPMC’s rationale for denying young patients who need gender-affirming care, the role federal funding may have played in that decision, and the specific services it chose to eliminate.
Advocates characterized UPMC’s actions as a shocking and premature indulgence of the administration’s anti-trans agenda. They pointed to lawsuits arguing the executive order is unconstitutional, the nationwide injunction blocking its enforcement and the City of Pittsburgh’s sanctuary laws shielding providers from criminalization.
“What UPMC is doing is preemptive and there’s no basis for it,” said Dena Stanley, a lead organizer of the rally and the executive director of TransYOUniting. The nonprofit serves LGBTQ+ and HIV-positive people, and helps run the QMNTY Center, a safe haven for the community on the North Side.
“We all understand what Trump is trying to do, but they also have power,” she said, noting that UPMC has the legal resources to “stand up and fight back.”
Stanley pointed out that UPMC is a major provider of gender-affirming surgeries in Western Pennsylvania. Its domination of the regional market leaves young people who need top surgeries with few alternatives unless they can afford to travel. “These children are just devastated,” she said. “And their families are devastated.”
Allegheny Health Network, the region’s other big health system, offers gender-affirming care at its Center for Inclusion Health, a low-barrier clinic on the North Side. Its Transgender Health Program provides primary care and surgical services including facial feminization and chest reconstruction.
“AHN remains committed to supporting the comprehensive needs of these patients, including primary care, surgical care and mental health support, while complying with all applicable laws,” a spokesperson wrote in response to detailed questions.
Some independently owned clinics are opening their doors to the young trans and queer patients who were denied care by UPMC. About two weeks ago, providers from Children’s Hospital started referring these patients to Allegheny Reproductive Health Center— an East Liberty clinic offering a range of gender-affirming services, according to Sheila Ramgopal, the center’s chief executive and an obstetrician and gynecologist.
Ramgopal said the providers were distraught while they spoke with the center’s staff, explaining they had been pulled into “a closed-door meeting” with UPMC executives. The executives reportedly told them they could no longer provide gender-affirming services to LGBTQ+ children, including hormone therapy and surgical services.

“We’re getting emails and messages from these providers who are desperately trying to find their clients care … My hats off to them for really trying to find places where people can go and still be safe, and hopefully they don’t get in trouble for doing that.”
If UPMC continues this policy in the long-term, Ramgopal predicted that some gender-affirming care providers will leave its system to treat young patients elsewhere. But non-compete agreements may bar them from working for other employers in the county, which means the region would lose their medical expertise unless UPMC agrees to not to enforce those agreements, they said.
Ramgopal said there’s precedent: UPMC allows abortion providers to leave its system for jobs at Allegheny Reproductive Health Center, Planned Parenthood of Western Pennsylvania and other independent facilities in the county. But they’re still barred from joining the AHN system.
“My hope is this would be a negotiable issue with UPMC,” they said. “There’s a lot of providers who live and work in Pittsburgh who want to continue to do this work here.”
A spokesperson didn’t answer a question about UPMC’s flexibility around non-compete agreements.

Greg Gianforte has made it clear that he wants the Legislature to pass income tax cuts for the third time since his election in 2020. 
This session, he wants to lower the state’s top tax rate — the rate most Montanans pay — by a full percentage point during the next two years. 
But the legislation he is backing — touted in his budget proposal last year, his State of the State address in January, and in multiple press conferences throughout the legislative session — has stalled in the Senate, while different proposals that take a narrower focus of lowering taxes for middle-income earners have received bipartisan support from lawmakers. 
The governor’s preferred proposal, Senate Bill 323, carried by Sen. Josh Kassmier, R-Fort Benton, had a hearing before the Senate Taxation Committee earlier this week. The bill would lower the top tax bracket (Montana has two brackets) from 5.9% to 5.4% next year, and down to 4.9% the following year. It would also expand the earned income tax credit from 10% to 15%.
 The bill was tabled in committee.
On Wednesday, Kassmier made a motion to blast the bill out of committee to the floor in order to let the entire Senate debate its merits, but the motion failed. 
“While I join all Montanans in being disappointed with the Senate’s vote yesterday, I am optimistic that by working together, we can get (income tax cuts) done for the Montanans who sent us here. And we must,” Gianforte said at a press conference on Thursday.

Meanwhile, two competing proposals that were also tabled in committees, Senate Bill 203, brought by Sen. Mike Yakawich, R-Billings, and Senate Bill 546, brought by Sen. Dave Fern, D-Whitefish, were blasted to the floor on Wednesday. 
Yakawich’s bill passed an initial Senate vote earlier this week 47-3 before the Senate Finance and Claims Committee tabled it. 
Sen. Greg Hertz, R-Polson, who leads the taxation committee, said he supported the “good bipartisan bill” coming back to the floor for a final vote, drawing contrasts to Kassmier’s bill.
“We know 323 was tabled. And the reason why? It started at the top,” Hertz said. “We’re starting at the bottom here. It’s a middle class tax cut. If you don’t want to bring this to the floor, you’re voting against a middle-class tax cut.”
Rather than cut the top tax bracket rate, SB 203 would expand the lower bracket — taxed at 4.7% — to include individuals making as much as $100,000. For married couples filing jointly the bracket delineation would be at $200,000, which Yakawich has said will cover up to the 90th percentile of earners. 
SB 203 passed the Senate in a final vote Thursday 31-19 and was sent to the House.
In convincing the Senate to hear SB 546 on the floor, Fern called it the “largest middle-class tax cut that’s being presented.”
“I have one of the best kept secrets in this chamber. This is great competition for middle class tax cuts. And I would love the opportunity to present this innovative, interesting, out of the box bill to all of you.”
The blast motion was successful, and the Senate debated the measure during Thursday’s session. 
Rather than tinker with the income tax rates, Fern’s proposal would create an income-based tax credit targeting exclusively the lower and middle income taxpayers. 
While he called the text a “mouthful,” Fern said the Middle Income Tax Reduction, MITR, would subtract a percentage of a filer’s tax liability, starting at 4.7% of taxable income and stepping down a percentage for additional income. 
Using a teacher filing jointly as an example, with a Montana taxable income of $70,000, Fern said those folks would receive about $930 as a tax credit.
“I suggest that MITR is the best bill that targets what I call a silent majority of our citizens and taxpayers. The MITR assures savings and spending so that dollars stay at home,” Fern said. “We’re not treating our middle class taxpayers, I think, with the respect they deserve.”
Speaking in opposition to the bill, Hertz said that lawmakers faced a decision over two bills that both cost $200 million a year. 
“(We) can’t have both of them. We’re going to have to choose one or the other. Although we might be able to do a hybrid method.”
He said Fern’s bill was too complicated by essentially creating “50 new tax brackets” due to the percentage-graded credit. He also expressed concern that it would make it harder for tax software companies to tailor their products for Montana, which presents a small portion of their customer base. 
“It doesn’t meet my simplification test,” he said. 
In support, Minority Leader Pat Flowers, D-Belgrade, said he was happy to see Democrats bring forth an income tax bill — which the party traditionally has opposed — specifically one so focused on lower-income earners. 
“For years, the income tax reduction proposals that have come here have done the same thing. They’ve primarily benefited taxpayers at the highest level,” Flowers said. “And who needs an income tax reduction? Is it somebody making $500,000 a year? No.”
Fern said that the bill could be amended to mesh with Yakawich’s, if the Legislature found that to be the best compromise on policy. 
The chamber passed the bill 28-21.

The other major income tax cut bill moving through the Legislature is House Bill 337, introduced by Speaker of the House Brandon Ler, R-Savage.
Ler’s bill falls in between the Yakawich proposal and the governor’s plan, It contains both a slight reduction in the top tax rate from 5.9% to 5.4%, and an expansion of the lower, 4.7% bracket up to $70,000 for individual filers, and $100,000 for joint filers. 
Tax day is less than two weeks away, and on the House floor Monday, Ler said he’d heard from many folks who were getting hit on their taxes from last year. His bill, he said, would benefit everyone. 
“This bill is aimed to lowering all income tax brackets. This will help all Montanans whether you’re low income or high income,” Ler said. 
The measure passed along party lines. 
In his press conference Thursday, Gianforte said that proposals aimed at expanding the lower tax bracket “only benefit a portion of Montanans.”
“Carving out special groups and giving special breaks to special interests or special groups of Montanans is just not fair,” the governor said. 
Pushed by reporters whether he was concerned that higher income Montanans wouldn’t receive a tax cut, Gianforte reiterated that his ultimate goal was to create a single, flat-tax rate for everyone.
 “It’s just basically fair,” he said. “You have a fairer system because everyone shares the burden based on their income level.”
He said that while his goal was to get a full 1% decrease in the top tax rate, “there can be honest debate about how much to reduce the top rate.”
He added that no lawmakers had approached him to discuss alternate tax plans. 
“If there’s a concern in the Legislature, let’s have a discussion,” he said. “None of those legislators have come to me to talk to me about an alternative proposal, so I would welcome the discussion. Let’s get around the table and figure this out for the people of Montana.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1040-forms-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-04 09:02:54.657037

Michael Johnson, R-Tega Cay, speaks Tuesday, April 1, 2025, at a subcommittee hearing on a bill that would permit betting on horse racing through online apps. (Screenshot of SCETV legislative livestream)COLUMBIA — Members of the state’s struggling equestrian community say legislation allowing South Carolinians to bet on horse racing through an app on their phone could revive a once-thriving industry.
Discussion opened this week in a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on a bipartisan proposal led by Sen. Michael Johnson, R-Tega Cay.
No vote was taken. There could be several more meetings before that happens.
It’s one of several bills filed this year to allow gambling in some form.
Advocates contend South Carolina misses out on millions in potential revenue from betting as it becomes more prominent — both legally and illegally.
Of the proposals, the bill dubbed the Equine Advancement Act likely has the best odds of passing.
However, even with the backing of one of the Legislature’s most powerful players — Senate Finance Chairman Harvey Peeler of Gaffney — it’s far from a sure bet in a Legislature that has historically avoided any change to the state’s anti-gambling laws. Nonprofit raffles didn’t become legal until 2015.
The proposal would allow gambling on horse racing on approved apps while specifying that other forms of gambling, such as slot machines or video poker, remain illegal.
That’s an attempt to quell concerns about re-opening the door to an industry that went gangbusters on the authority of a little-noticed clause slipped into the state budget in 1986.
“This bill is very narrowly tailored,” Johnson said. “The goal is to take the proceeds from this and pump that directly into our equine industry — horse training, horse farms, horse racing, all of those things — so that they have an opportunity to compete with the other states that already have this.”
His legislation — which is going through Peeler’s committee — will likely advance to the floor.
That would follow the recent precedent of two similar bills sponsored by former GOP Sen. Katrina Shealy of Lexington. Those bills advanced through her committee to reach the floor in 2022 and 2024, but neither ever got a vote in the chamber.
It’s unclear whether the gambling foes in the Senate can still block debate, or whether there’s been enough of a sea change in the chamber’s mindset that it actually has a chance. Few senators are left who participated in the Legislature’s fight to get rid of video poker and vowed not to allow a repeat.
After all, it’s been 25 years since a state Supreme Court ruling made video poker illegal.
Notably, November brought 13 new senators, the largest freshman class in the 46-member Senate in at least a generation. They include former Rep. Russell Ott, who was the chief sponsor of the horse race betting bill that the House passed on a 55-46 vote in 2023.
Should senators open floor debate on the latest proposal, Sen. Chip Campsen said he’ll be providing the uninitiated a lengthy history lesson.
“We have a terrible history when it comes to gambling in South Carolina, and I don’t want my children or my grandchildren raised in a place like South Florida,” said the Isle of Palms Republican, who was in the House when the multibillion-dollar video poker industry overplayed its hand with a lawsuit that backfired.
“You want to go gamble, gamble in Florida, but don’t make us Florida. Don’t make us Las Vegas,” Campsen said.
Representatives of both the Palmetto Family Council and the South Carolina Baptist Convention, which have successfully lobbied against gambling bills in the past, told the SC Daily Gazette they will continue to fight the proposals.
“When you use something like a vice to promote income or revenue, you always have to have more of it,” said Tony Beam, a lobbyist for the Baptist Convention. “It doesn’t do anything to make a state better.”
Even if a pro-gambling bill manages to make it to Gov. Henry McMaster’s desk, it faces an almost guaranteed veto from the Republican who has opposed gambling over his entire career.
“Once you start letting gambling into the house, it will grow,” McMaster said Tuesday, making clear his position hasn’t changed.
“Gambling is bad for our culture,” he continued. “It’s not part of our heritage and there are better ways to make money, to give jobs, to generate tax money, to generate a thriving economy.”
The argument for apps
The horse industry brings in $2 billion annually and is responsible for nearly 29,000 jobs, according to a 2019 state-commissioned study from the Department of Agriculture.
Advocates told senators Tuesday the industry is being decimated as horses and trainers leave South Carolina — once a hot spot for horse owners due to its climate and abundance of rural land — for states like Virginia and New York that offer incentives for horses that are bred and certified in the state.
Farms and horse barns that once served as community sanctuaries are disappearing and being replaced by office buildings or parking lots, said Frank Mullins, president of the Aiken Steeplechase, held in a city where many of the roads are purposefully left unpaved for equestrian traffic.
SC equestrians call for Senate to pass bill legalizing horse race betting

“It’s not good for the essence of our state, not good for the ambience of our small towns,” Mullins said.
“We have an opportunity to reverse this,” he continued. “Allowing horse race betting in South Carolina will give us an opportunity to be competitive with other states.”
Mullins said the facilities for the steeplechase get used only twice a year for competition. Should there be legalized betting, he’ll likely add additional races.
“My singular goal is to try to find a way to use this place more than twice a year,” he said.
South Carolina would join 41 states that permit online gambling on horse races, according to the Action Network, a sports media company focused on gambling.
North Carolina legalized it in March 2024, but there are no entities licensed to offer or accept horse racing bets in the state, according to the North Carolina State Lottery Commission website.
As for the details, Johnson’s proposal would create a seven-member board to manage the program and license the apps that people could use for betting; 5% of all wagers would go to the industry. The commission would decide how to dole out that money, which could include vocational schooling, renovating training centers or supplementing prize money for horse races.
The gambling industry is dangling lots of carrots.
A 2022 analysis by Racing Resource Group, an analytics business specializing in horse racing, projected the state would see at least $40 million in horse racing wagers and as much as $70 million. The proposed 5% would translate to $2 million to $3.5 million annually for the industry under those estimates.
However, advocates say they’re optimistic wagers will surpass $70 million once the betting is legalized and gambling increases — which is precisely what gambling opponents worry about.
Kip Elser, who was speaking on behalf of the South Carolina and Thoroughbred and Breeders Association and the state’s Equine Council, said $2 million is the minimum the industry needs to start bouncing back.
GOP Sen. Billy Garrett of Greenwood, an opponent of the bill, suggested the council simply ask for the money as an earmark in the state budget. The money could go through the state’s Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism, as many millions of dollars do annually.
But Elser said legalizing betting would be better for equestrians.
“We would rather get a leg up and be self-supported,” he said.
‘Quit burying our heads in the sand’
There are other bills that would allow wide-open gambling, though none have gotten a hearing.
Rep. Chris Murphy, a Dorchester County Republican, is the lead sponsor of a bipartisan bill that would allow the state’s first casino to be built near the intersection of interstates 26 and 95 in Orangeburg County.
The bill relegates permission to the state’s poorest counties.
It starts off with the declaration that “casino gaming is not consistent with nor compatible with the economic, labor, or tourism industry profile for most communities in South Carolina.”
However, it continues, for the “rural and impoverished school districts” along I-95, “casino gaming in these counties is consistent and compatible with their economic, labor, and tourism profiles” as a potential job creator and education opportunity enhancer for the children living there.
Other proposals in the House and Senate would regulate sports gambling in the state.
Still another proposes asking voters in a referendum whether the constitution should be amended to allow the Legislature to pass laws legalizing gambling, with the profits paying for roadwork wherever gambling is allowed.
Putting that question on the ballot avoids McMaster’s veto, since such resolutions don’t go to the governor’s desk. But the measure would still require supermajority votes in each chamber, which is highly unlikely.
Proponents argue gambling is already happening; the state’s just not making any money off the illegal, unregulated transactions.
Sen. Brad Hutto, D-Orangeburg, said people gamble on horse races anyway, whether it’s at the Aiken Steeplechase or the Carolina Cup in Camden. He’s seen it often, he told his colleagues.
Ott, who is a co-sponsor of Johnson’s bill, said if the Legislature made gambling legal, the state would not only profit from it but could regulate it and put money into programs combatting gambling addiction.
“It’s just time for us to quit burying our heads in the sand, acting like this is not happening right now in the state of South Carolina,” said the St. Matthews Democrat. “It’s time for us to get caught up with times and to use it in a way that can be a real benefit.”

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos/NJ Monitor)With four proposals to amend Maine’s laws regarding the concealed carry of a firearm, the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee is suggesting to keep current practice in place.
“I think we do have a good balance right now in our constitutional carry law,” said Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn), who voted against the proposed changes.  
The committee held a work session Thursday for a slate of gun legislation. While some measures were tabled for further discussion, the four bills about where someone can have a firearm, when they need to inform law enforcement and age requirements to carry were voted down by a majority of the committee. Some of the bills received bipartisan votes, and others were along party lines. 
The committee overwhelmingly voted 11-2 not to change the law that requires someone carrying a concealed weapon without a valid permit to inform law enforcement immediately during routine traffic stops, arrests or detainment. LD 1049 originally sought to repeal that requirement, but its sponsor, Rep. Jennifer Poirier (R-Skowhegan), amended her proposal during the work session so that an officer would have to ask first.
However, multiple committee members brought up other constitutional concerns, including potential violations of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, which protect individuals against unlawful search and seizure and from self incrimination. Others said they couldn’t support the bill because the law was written to protect law enforcement, and some officers expressed concern about changes to the law. 
There was also bipartisan support to maintain current law that says an employer can’t prohibit an employee from storing a firearm in their vehicle if the employee has a valid permit to carry a concealed firearm, so long as the vehicle is locked and the firearm is stored out of sight. 
While Rep. Alicia Collins (R-Sidney) sought with LD 998 to remove the requirement that an employee have a valid concealed carry permit, the committee weighed the competing interests of property rights and the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
Ultimately, the committee voted 10-3 against the proposal, with many members agreeing current law already did a sufficient job at balancing employer versus employee rights. 
While the majority also voted against legislation to update statutory language about carrying in state parks and lowering the age that someone can carry without a permit to 18, those proposals received party line votes. 
Sen. David Haggan (R-Penobscot) said during the public hearing that he introduced LD 829 to clean up confusion in existing law by making it clear that someone can carry a concealed firearm in a state park, so long as they are not otherwise prohibited from possessing one. 
Committee co-chair Rep. Amy Kuhn (D-Falmouth) said she wasn’t going to support the proposal because the Legislature had previously considered that statute and didn’t see any reason why it should be changed. 
However, Rep. Rachel Henderson (R-Rumford) said she backed the legislation because of what she saw as a need for protection against other people as well as animals in remote areas of state parks. 
Democrats similarly didn’t want to reduce the age limit that a person can carry without a permit, while Republicans were in favor of doing so. The committee voted 7-5 to reject LD 424. 
Current law requires someone who is 18 to 20 years old and without military training to have a permit to carry concealed. Someone can carry without a permit starting at age 21.
Rep. Dani O’Halloran (D-Brewer) pointed out that 18-year-olds are often still in high school, so she couldn’t justify taking away the training requirements for someone at that age to be able to carry a firearm. 
Henderson suggested an amendment, which her Republican colleagues supported, to add language clarifying that someone could carry concealed without a permit starting at age 18, except if they are still in high school. 
While Haggan said society has already decided someone is an adult at 18 and has given them other rights such as voting, Kuhn argued that people 18 to 20 can also be more impulsive and carrying a firearm can come with deadly consequences.

(Photo by Alex Goodlett for Utah News Dispatch)In the last five years, lawmakers have passed on average 40 bills during each 45-day legislative session that either create new criminal offenses or increase the penalty for existing crimes. 
It’s part of a trend that Utah Gov. Spencer Cox calls “unsustainable.” 
This year was no different, with lawmakers introducing 77, and passing 43, bills to either add, enhance or expand criminal penalties. There were just eight bills, six successful, that sought to narrow, reduce or repeal. 
Now, Utah has dozens of new laws and increased penalties in state code. It’s now a class B misdemeanor for a public employee to use public money for union activity; trafficking large quantities of fentanyl is now a standalone first-degree felony; obstructing traffic while failing to comply with law enforcement is now a class B misdemeanor.

That’s just a taste of the 43 bills that passed this session. A full list of these new bills is available here. 
And while all 43 were signed by Cox, the governor said the volume of changes to the state’s criminal code gives him pause. 
“I’m concerned about the strain this rapid growth in new offenses places on our incarceration resources. I’ve heard from many stakeholders — including law enforcement leaders — that the sheer volume of recent changes has become difficult to manage,” the governor said in his end-of-session letter to lawmakers. “There is also a valid question as to whether these enhancements, absent an overarching strategy, will actually achieve the public safety goals they’re intended to address.” 
To that end, Cox signed an executive order last week creating a new task force aimed at reviewing the state’s criminal justice policy. 
Announced late on Thursday night, the task force will be charged with evaluating “how current criminal justice laws and policies are serving the state — and developing a comprehensive framework — will improve criminal justice efforts in our state,” according to the executive order. 
The task force will consist of the following department heads, or someone they designate to serve in their place: 

The Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice 
The Utah Department of Public Safety 
The Utah Department of Corrections 
The Governor’s Office of Planning and Budget 
The chair of the Board of Pardons and Parole 
Any other state agency “deemed necessary to accomplish the Task Force’s responsibilities”

A member of the Utah House of Representatives and Senate will also be appointed to the task force. 
The task force will create a framework for the governor and lawmakers on the Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice Interim Committee to review by October, which per Cox’s executive order, will consider 10 things: 

Public safety 
Deterrence 
Proportionality (meaning punishments should fit the crime) 
Judicial discretion and consistency 
Rehabilitation and treatment 
Recidivism 
Costs and resources 
Jail and prison capacity 
Victim needs 
Research and data

Then, Utah’s state agencies will use that framework to complete a report, which will be submitted to the committee, on how best to approach criminal justice policy in the state.  
Cox’s task force builds on a bill sponsored by Rep. Ryan Wilcox, R-Ogden, that requires state agencies to review criminal offenses that pertain to the department, then make recommendations to the legislature on what could be repealed or redefined. 
The bill, HB353, is one of the few pieces of legislation passed this year that actually repeals certain criminal offenses, some of which “haven’t been charged in over a decade,” Wilcox said during the session. 
It also moves a number of misdemeanor crimes to an infraction, the lowest criminal penalty in state code.  
Cox said he likes the bill. But it will be one of a handful this year that he allows to go into law without his signature, “not because I don’t like the bill, but because I think we can do even more,” he said. 
A ‘one-way ratchet’ 
During the session, Wilcox told lawmakers during a committee meeting he’s “hyper aware of that one-way ratchet” when it comes to criminal justice policy — meaning, each year lawmakers pass far more bills that create or increase criminal penalties than bills that repeal or reduce. 
So why does it matter? What’s wrong with holding criminals accountable? 
For people like Steve Burton, a defense attorney and director of the Utah Defense Attorney Association, it can sometimes strip the nuance from criminal justice policy. That’s the case particularly for bills that impose mandatory minimum sentences.

“They treat a lot of people the same,” Burton said, while costing taxpayers thousands of dollars more each year to incarcerate someone, regardless of how the state’s criminal justice policies might evolve. 
And generally speaking, a tough-on-crime approach is just an ineffective way to approach criminal justice, he said. For instance, making a misdemeanor crime a felony means the convicted will have a much harder time finding a job — and having steady employment is one of the main factors in reducing recidivism. 
Plus, keeping people incarcerated longer often increases their social ties with other criminals, another factor that increases recidivism. And, if the convicted person is a parent, that means they’ll be spending less time with their kids — statistically, that heightens the risk that their children will engage in criminal behavior.  
“When we think that we’re being tough on crime, we’re actually often increasing the risk of that person reoffending and creating more victims,” said Burton.  
Plus, harsher sentences can give prosecutors more power in what is supposed to be a balanced system. A harsher penalty means the person charged is more likely to plead guilty to minimize time spent in prison. It depends on the source, but typically just 2% to 5% of cases actually go to trial, with most cases either resulting in a guilty plea or a case being dismissed. 
“With the vast majority of cases being resolved through plea bargain, that means that the decision-making power is in the prosecutor’s hands as to what the ultimate penalty should be. And the more that you increase penalties, the more you incentivize defendants to not take their case to trial,” said Burton.

HB 166, sponsored by Rep. Leigh Hulsey, R-Helena, passed the chamber 79-15. It requires local school boards to adopt a policy to store student cell phones during class hours. Hulsey said during a floor debate on Thursday that the devices could be stored in a device like a Yondr Pouch or a shoe organizer.
“The majority of the schools already participating in this are storing the cell phones in the classroom in various ways,” Hulsey said.

Yondr Pouches are an expensive option compared to a $10 plastic over-the-door shoe organizer. Pike Road Junior High School Principal Christy Wright showed the Senate Education Policy Committee how the school implements a ban in February. The $30 Yondr Pouches at Pike Road were purchased with a grant.
According to the bill, cell phones can be stored in a locker, car or other storage device so long as the device is not on the student’s person. According to the Pew Research Center, 72% of U.S. high school teachers say that cellphone distraction is a major issue in their classrooms. 
Democratic representatives were concerned about how a student would access their phones in an emergency. Rep. Barbara Drummond, D-Mobile, said that with school shootings a constant threat, a child should be able to contact their parents. According to the K-12 School Shooting Database, there were 332 school shootings in 2024. There have been 52 in 2025 so far. 
“We as a body need to protect our kids since we will not pass a bill to keep guns away from our school children,” Drummond said.
Drummond has sponsored bills over the last several years that would effectively require parents to safely store firearms at home. The bills would also have allowed parents to be charged with misdemeanors if a child brought an unsecured weapon to school. But the legislation has not moved. A House committee killed Drummond’s latest version of the bill in February. 
Rep. Napoleon Bracy, D-Prichard, brought up another potential event that could develop at school where a child may need to contact their parents. He said a student could need a change of clothes in the middle of the day.
“It’s not a situation where it’s life or death, it’s not like somebody is coming in for a school shooting,” he said. “I just think it’s overreaching.”
According to the bill, a student can have access to their phones under three exceptions: if they study under an Individualized Education Plan that allows it; for teacher-approved instruction and for medical purposes.
Hulsey claimed that there is data that shows that cell phone bans cause improved test scores, retained information and students’ mental health. Rep. Mary Moore, D-Birmingham, said she would like to see that data.
“I’ve just not seen the preponderance of students playing games while the teacher is trying to teach, the room being disrupted and out of order,” she said. “I would just like to see that data at some point.”
Alabama Department of Mental Health Commissioner Kimberly Boswell said in February the mental health of students would improve under the ban. Rep. Terri Collins, R-Decatur, echoed that and supported the legislation on the House floor Thursday.
“It’s going to make a difference,” Collins said.
The House approved an amendment that removed punishments on schools that do not comply. Hulsey said she wished that was still in the bill but would bring a bill in a few years after seeing compliance. There is a survey required in the legislation to monitor compliance.
“I haven’t passed a bill yet that I’ve loved every single thing about it,” Hulsey said. “All of it takes compromise to move the needle a little bit.”
Rep. Pebblin Warren, D-Tuskegee, said that enforcement could be difficult without sanctions.
“We need to put some teeth into this bill,” Warren said. “If we don’t we’re going to be in the same position next year as we are this year.”
The legislation moves to the Senate. Sen. Donnie Chesteen, R-Geneva, has filed a companion bill in that chamber.

Lawmakers held a news conference before the session even started, declaring public safety to be a priority this year. And as the session moved along, more than 100 bills were introduced that deal with law enforcement and public safety. 
At least 77 bills were introduced that sought to ramp up criminal penalties in Utah, with 43 of them passing and signed by Utah Gov. Spencer Cox. 
That includes new criminal offenses — like a bill from Rep. Matt Gwynn, R-Farr West, that makes trafficking fentanyl a standalone crime.

Or bills that impose harsher penalties, create new aggravating factors (which is when a judge can give a longer sentence based on the severity of a crime) and require mandatory minimum sentences — for instance, a law from Rep. Candice Pierucci, R-Herriman, that increases the penalty for human trafficking for sexual exploitation, while imposing a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years.
And there were bills that widened the scope of existing crimes — like Clearfield GOP Rep. Karianne Lisonbee’s bill to expand the definition of domestic violence in the presence of a child to include strangulation or choking. 
It’s part of a recent trend at Utah’s Capitol Hill. In the last five years, lawmakers have passed an average of 40 bills each session that add, increase or enhance criminal penalties — in that same timeframe, they averaged just six bills each session to repeal, decrease or narrow criminal penalties.  
According to the governor’s office, and the Utah Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice, here’s a list of all 43 bills passed by lawmakers and signed by Cox. Many of them were signed last week by Cox, and have an effective date of May 7. 

HB13, Sexual Extortion Amendments widens the definition of sexual extortion to include “threatening to distribute a counterfeit intimate image,” which includes a computer-generated or manipulated image or video. 
HB19, Child Labor Amendments enhances the penalty for repeat child labor violations, starting with a class B misdemeanor for a first offense, a class A misdemeanor for a second offense, and a third-degree felony for three or more violations. 
HB22, Prostitution Offense Amendments imposes new penalties for people who solicit prostitution from a child, creates the crime of “entering or remaining in a place of prostitution” and creates new definitions in Utah code regarding sex work.
HB38, Criminal Offenses Modifications creates a new offense for recruiting minors to join a street gang, which could be a second- or first-degree felony if a weapon is used to intimidate; increases the metric used when determining loss in retail theft; increases the penalties and widens the scope of sexual extortion; and allows for increased penalties for theft-related crimes if the person was guilty of a similar offense in another state. 
HB53, Litter Cleanup Amendments makes throwing burning material on a highway (which was previously an infraction) a class C misdemeanor. 


HB66, Ritual Abuse Amendments creates an aggravating factor for child abuse committed as part of a ritual, defined as using “ceremonial objects, ceremonial clothing, religious texts, or specific words.” That means a judge can impose a harsher sentence if a perpetrator is found guilty. 
HB69, Government Records and Information Amendments prohibits a government officer from accessing certain voter information, making it a class B misdemeanor.
HB78, Criminal Offenses Amendments increases the penalty for people who knowingly commit aggravated child abuse, raising it from a second-degree felony to a first-degree felony. It also restricts a court from granting probation or a suspended sentence to people guilty of violent crimes like murder, kidnapping or rape, with some exceptions. 
HB80, Disorderly Conduct Amendments creates a criminal offense called aggravated disorderly conduct on a street or highway, defined as intentionally blocking traffic on a road with a speed limit of at least 40 miles per hour. It’s a class B misdemeanor on first offense and class A misdemeanor for a second offense.
HB87, Drug Trafficking Amendments creates a new criminal offense for trafficking fentanyl or a fentanyl-related substance. If someone is caught with more than 100 grams of fentanyl, they could be charged with a first-degree felony, with no option for probation or a suspended sentence.
HB96, Fraud Amendments changes the scope of defrauding a creditor. If the unpaid balance is less than $10,000, it would be a class A misdemeanor; if it’s more than $10,000, it can be enhanced to a third-degree felony. 
HB105, Criminal Code Modifications makes attempted murder a first-degree felony with a minimum prison term of five years, increases the penalty for a teacher who has a sexual relationship with an adult student to a third-degree felony, and creates a crime called indecent exposure of another individual in public, a class C or B misdemeanor depending on the severity, and a class A misdemeanor if done in front of a child.  
HB127, Sexual Crime Amendments increases the prison term for sex crimes like rape and forcible sodomy from a minimum of five years to 10 years if the victim is an “incapacitated individual,” which typically means they have some kind of intellectual disability. 
HB128, Dangerous Weapon at a School Amendments applies the crime of possessing a dangerous weapon on school premises to a minor. 
HB148, Child Sexual Abuse Amendments creates an aggravating factor for sex crimes involving children if the perpetrator traveled more than 45 miles from their residence, or paid a child to travel more than 45 miles. An aggravating factor means a judge can impose a harsher sentence. 
HB183, Noncitizen Restricted Person Amendments makes an immigrant with a pending application for asylum or temporary protected status a restricted person, meaning they cannot purchase or own a firearm. If they do, they could be charged with a second-degree felony. 
HB190, Motorcycle Amendments prohibits motorcyclists from lane splitting (which is when a motorcycle rides between two lanes while traffic is moving) and performing a wheelie on a highway, which could now result in a suspended license. 
HB196, Vehicle Traction Amendments creates a traffic infraction for drivers who fail to use specific traction equipment, like snow tires, if required by the Utah Department of Transportation. 
HB197, Criminal Conduct Amendments widens the crime of enticement of a minor to include all communications with the intent to entice, not just communications with the minor. That means communications with the minor’s parents, with the intent to entice, would be criminal. 
HB199, Substance Use Treatment and Enforcement Amendments touches on a number of issues regarding substance use, including a new offense targeting people who rent buildings for the purpose of drug activity, called maintenance of a drug-involved premises, a second-degree felony. 
HB207, Sexual Offense Revisions imposes a mandatory minimum sentencing increase of five years each time a person is convicted of a second- or third-degree felony sexual offense; widens the scope of sexual exploitation of a minor to include accessing child sexual abuse material (sometimes referred to as child pornography) with the intent to view; and increases the penalty for aggravated sexual exploitation of a minor 14 years old or older from a second-degree felony to a first-degree felony. 
HB226, Criminal Amendments makes the maximum sentence for a violent class A misdemeanor 365 days, an increase of one day. Per federal law, a one-year prison or jail sentence automatically initiates deportation proceedings for someone who is not a U.S. citizen, and the bill is intended to facilitate the federal push for more deportations. 
HB267, Public Sector Labor Union Amendments imposes a class B misdemeanor on public employees who use taxpayer funds for union activity. 
HB290, Bicycle Lane Safety Amendments creates an infraction for drivers who obstruct or drive on bike lanes or sidewalks. 
HB312, Criminal Justice Amendments makes a number of procedural changes for jails, including redefining “habitual offender” and preventing the release of people convicted of drug and violence-related crimes. It also widens the scope of domestic violence in the presence of a child to include strangulation or choking. 
HB358, Criminal Sexual Conduct Amendments creates a crime called unlawful sexual activity with a child using virtual reality, a third-degree felony, where an adult sexually targets an avatar or video game character that they know belongs to a minor. If the perpetrator is less than 10 years older than the child, it’s a third-degree felony. 
HB405, Human Trafficking Amendments increases the penalty for human trafficking for sexual exploitation, moving it from a second-degree felony to a first-degree felony. It also imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years; if the child victim is less than 14 years old, the minimum sentence is 15 years. 
HB430, Security and Land Restriction Amendments targets foreign espionage in Utah, specifically on and around military bases, and creates a third-degree felony for anyone who buys land on behalf of a restricted foreign entity (which includes Russia, Iran, China and North Korea). 
HB478, Brine Mining Amendments creates a class B misdemeanor for anyone who makes a false statement or report related to the Brine Conservation Act, which deals with the drilling and production of lithium, magnesium, bromine and other minerals extracted from salt water. 
HB505, Homeless Services Revisions creates a class C misdemeanor for unsanctioned camping on state property. 
SB24, Child Abuse and Torture Amendments creates a new crime called child torture for the most extreme cases of child abuse, a third-degree felony that, with some exceptions, would be punishable by a 10-year minimum sentence. 
SB55, Unauthorized Use of Residential Real Property Amendments targets illegal squatting, creating a second-degree felony for trespassers who cause more than $1,000 in damage; and a second-degree felony for people who falsely advertise, rent or sell a residential property that isn’t theirs. 
SB68, Child Welfare Worker Protections separates the crime of assault or threat of violence against a child welfare worker into two sections; and makes assaulting or threatening the family of a child welfare worker a class A misdemeanor.   
SB77, Police Service Animal Amendments expands the current criminal code regarding police canines to include all public safety animals. 
SB82, Autopsy Photo Amendments creates a class B misdemeanor for anyone who receives a non-public autopsy photograph of a deceased person and shares it. 
SB90, Mandatory Jail Sentence Amendments requires a judge to impose a mandatory jail or prison sentence for crimes committed by a person who has already been deported, then charged with felony reentry to the U.S.
SB144, Sexual Crimes Amendments widens the definition of child sexual abuse material; expands the crime of sexual exploitation of a minor to include accessing child sexual abuse material “with the intent to view”; and makes aggravated sexual exploitation of a minor over 14 years old a first-degree felony, eliminating a carveout that imposed a lesser, second-degree felony if the victim was a teenager. 
SB149, Natural Resources Modifications makes a number of changes to Utah code regarding hunting on public land, including creating a class B misdemeanor for operating as a hunting guide without first registering with the state; and a class B misdemeanor for knowingly retaining a guide who isn’t registered. 
SB170, School Discipline Amendments prohibits corporal punishment and seclusion in schools. School employees who violate the law could be charged with unlawful detention or unlawful detention of a minor, a class B misdemeanor. 
SB195, Transportation Amendments is an omnibus transportation bill that, among other things, expands the scope of certain bicycle-related infractions regarding speed, reckless operation and night usage to include electric unicycles and electric personal assistive mobility devices (often used by people who have difficulty walking or a disability). 
SB215, Emergency Medical Services Modifications makes it a class B misdemeanor to willfully disobey a cease and desist letter or subpoena from the Utah Bureau of Emergency Medical Services. 
SB336, Utah Fairpark Area Investment and Restoration District Modifications imposes a class B misdemeanor on any member of the Utah Fairpark Area Investment and Restoration District Board (which governs the area where lawmakers hope to soon see a Major League Baseball stadium) who fails to submit a disclosure statement.

Photo by Stephen Ausmus/Agricultural Research Service, USDA.For Minnesota legislators looking for ways to protect workers, an unlikely source has provided an important blueprint. 
Federal Trade Commission Chair Andrew Ferguson is establishing a Joint Labor Task Force that will prioritize investigating corporate conduct that harms workers. In announcing the task force Ferguson wrote that “deceptive, unfair, and anticompetitive labor practices are widespread” and identifies a range of harmful practices, including noncompete agreements, wage-fixing agreements and the abuse of consolidated power.
While an antitrust agency might not seem the obvious place for labor policy, the unchecked rise of monopoly power is a significant threat to workers. Ferguson’s announcement continues the approach of his predecessor, Lina Khan, and other Biden administration regulators. That approach is not new, as the architects of our antitrust laws understood the threat monopolies pose to workers. Sen. John Sherman, author of the Sherman Antitrust Act, said in 1892 that a monopoly “commands the price of labor without fear of strikes, for in its field it allows no competitors.”
That statement rings true today. The average local labor market in the U.S. is considered highly concentrated by federal antitrust guidelines, and one out of every eight labor markets is dominated by a single employer. The result of that, according to a 2022 study by the Treasury Department, is that the average worker earns roughly 20% less than they would if there was more competition.
In 2023 Minnesota took a step in addressing that issue by requiring the impacts on health care workers to be considered when evaluating large health care mergers. Legislators could build on that law by requiring labor market analysis as part of merger review across the economy. States across the country have proposed requiring more pre-merger notification and labor market analysis could be made a part of such a proposal. Legislators could also pass the Fair Competition Act, which would make it clear that the abuse of monopsony power — when big players use their power to push down prices from suppliers and labor — is a violation of Minnesota’s antitrust law.
A recent $180 million wage-fixing settlement among the largest firms in the poultry industry shows another consequence of unchecked monopoly power. Companies not only gain greater power over workers but can also more easily collude with those firms that remain. In an economy that has grown 50% more consolidated since 2005, this behavior is likely to increase. 
Unfortunately, a 2007 Supreme Court decision has made it more difficult to bring price and wage-fixing cases. Legislators could ease enforcement by amending Minnesota law to shift the burden onto defendants instead of requiring plaintiffs to provide explicit evidence of price-fixing before further facts can be obtained through discovery. 
Traditional wage-fixing is just the tip of the iceberg. A recent report on surveillance prices and wages demonstrates how detailed data collection to feed algorithms and artificial intelligence will make it even easier for companies to conspire against workers and drive down wages. One approach to this emerging challenge is to prohibit algorithmic price and wage-fixing, which some legislators are seeking to do in the rental industry. The use of third-party analytics companies to fix prices and wages is not confined to housing, however. Legislators could draw on a federal proposal, Senator Amy Klobuchar’s Preventing Algorithmic Collusion Act, for a way to prohibit tacit collusion against workers across Minnesota’s economy.  
In addition to the impact on wages and jobs, anticompetitive conduct is transforming the basics of what a worker really is. Consider a proposal to allow Uber and Lyft drivers to unionize. The underlying reason such legislation is necessary is because ridesharing platforms misclassify their workers as independent contractors and then exert control using anticompetitive “vertical restraints,” which are contracts governing buyer-seller relationships.
This business model would have been a clear violation of antitrust laws before a multi-decade effort to weaken enforcement against anticompetitive vertical restraints. Now gig companies and others are able to maintain a system of “control without responsibility” — firms can tightly manage individuals while avoiding the legal and financial responsibilities of formal employment. Uber controls the routes and rates supposedly independent drivers receive while the “independent” trucking companies Amazon uses must deliver packages exclusively for Amazon in vehicles branded by Amazon, and using routes, rates and schedules dictated by Amazon.
Minnesota took steps to limit vertical restraints by banning non compete clauses and no-poach agreements in 2023. But lawmakers could build off that work by strengthening the state’s antitrust laws to more clearly prohibit the use of other anticompetitive and coercive contracts that exploit workers and limit freedom and mobility. 
For too long the concept of what constitutes labor policy has been narrowly confined to issues like minimum wage rates and right-to-work laws, but our antimonopoly tools are an important part of keeping workers from suffering under the thumb of monopolists.

He shared a photo of signing Senate Bill 43 into law, pictured by himself at his desk in his Juneau office, with the Alaska and U.S. flags on either side.
Bill sponsor Sen. Elvi Gray-Jackson, D-Anchorage, celebrated the occasion. 
“Women’s history in Alaska is not only about past achievements but is also a way to honor the current and future contributions of women in Alaska,” Gray-Jackson said in a written statement Thursday. “This bill is aimed to encourage our Alaskan communities to honor the contributions of women who have helped paved the way throughout our state’s rich history.”

“By recognizing Women’s History Month, we make it clear to women, especially young women and girls that they should not be afraid to be the bold leaders Alaska needs to guide us into the future,” Peltola said. “We also honor the trailblazers that came before us, displayed remarkable leadership, and now serve as role models for our generation and the next.”

Joe Lombardo housing bill, which allocates $250 million in funding to build more housing and expands the definition of affordable housing to include higher incomes. 
Lombardo has previously focused his attention on addressing the state’s housing crisis by calling on the federal government to release more federal land he argues is needed to build more housing – even as housing groups warn against urban sprawl and a local analysis shows significant infill land available.
Assembly Bill 540, heard Wednesday night by the Assembly Commerce and Labor Committee, seeks to use state general funds to help finance the development of housing. 
The bill also expands the threshold of affordable housing to include households making 150% of area median income and allows out-of-state contractors to develop in rural areas, which is currently prohibited by state law. 
Lombardo, appearing briefly before the panel Wednesday to introduce the bill, said the legislation “expedites permanent housing solutions” and described his bill as the “action plan to get this done so that significant progress is already underway in Nevada before land is even released.”
Democratic Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, citing the tariffs Trump announced on all imports from all countries Wednesday that sent financial markets into a severe tailspin Thursday, said Lombardo’s bill doesn’t match the times.
The National Association of Homebuilders, Yeager added, anticipates tariffs will drive up the cost of all housing and construction costs.
“I do think there is a twinge of irony that we as a state are asking the federal government to give us land to be able to build but at the same time we are seeing federal policies that maybe prevent us from building on that land that’s being released,” Yeager said. “I don’t know if this is the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing.”
Yeager asked if Lombardo’s office had talked with Trump about the newly announced sweeping tariffs, and how their economic fallout could impede the state from building more housing.
Ryan Cherry, the governor’s chief of staff, said while the office has talked with the Trump administration about housing costs, “as far as tariffs, we have not had direct conversations as of this time.”  
Asked earlier in the week, before the scope and scale of Trump’s tariff proposals announced Wednesday were known, about the impacts of tariffs and Trump’s other economic policies, Lombardo said Nevada will “make adjustments on the fly.”
Nevada Housing Division Administrator Steve Aichroth, who helped present the bill on Wednesday, noted the state has already had to weather high interest rights and supply chain issues in the last few years. 
Despite how Covid exacerbated the housing crisis, the state still tried to find a way to build, Aichroth said. 
While everyone would prefer to “build in a perfect environment,” Aichroth said, “we haven’t seen a perfect environment in a long time. But we have to build. We have to get projects built and on the ground.”   
The American Rescue Plan Act, passed and signed into law in 2021 by President Joe Biden, allocated billions of dollars of relief funds to the state. 
The state directed $500 million of that assistance to the Home Means Nevada fund, which offered financing for housing projects throughout the state and helped prevent building from being stalled, Aichroth said.  
“Whether it’s tariffs or higher interest rates, any of those challenges we hear from builders and laborers, all of those factor into the current housing eco-system,” he said. “There is never a perfect time to do this. We have to play the cards we are dealt.”
AB 540 would change the definition of affordable housing to “attainable housing,” creating the Nevada Attainable Housing Fund and Council, which will oversee the allocation of $250 million in funding for housing projects. 
Christine Hess, the chief financial officer of the Nevada Housing Division, said that $50 million of the funds will be directed toward “loans and will remain assets of the division’s trust so that we can continue to issue the hundreds of millions of bonds annually for home ownership and multi-family rental housing.”
Hess said while financing building for buyers with more than 150% of area household median income — more than $120,000 a year in Nevada —  “sounds like a lot,” it was designed to meet the changing landscape of the cost of housing. 
“The median home price up and up in Reno is $600,000,” she said. “The idea was that up to 150% gives the division with input from the communities and stakeholders, to be flexible, and the amount of public funding.” 
Aichroth added the state has “programs that basically focus on 60% and 80% and below.”
Though there are other resources for lower income earners, the need is far greater. 
There are only 17 available homes for every 100 extremely low income households making less than 30% of AMI compared to 94 available homes per 100 renter households making 100% of AMI, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. 
Democratic Assemblymember Brittney Miller asked how projects would be prioritized. 
Aichroth said it would be a combination of community need and financial feasibility.
He added the feasibility piece was extremely important “to ensure that the projects can get built, built to fruition, and house people for a good length of time.”
Real estate interests and homebuilding firms supported the bill, saying it would alleviate issues faced when it comes to developing more housing. 
Val Thomason, with the Democratic Socialists of America, said the bill “seems like a giveaway to property developers.” 
 No prevailing wage requirements 
Lawmakers asked little about expanding households to include 150% AMI and changing the definition of affordable housing to attainable, and how that portion of the measure might come at the expense of lower income households.  
Instead they directed much of their focus on the section of the bill that exempts projects from paying prevailing wages to construction workers that state law typically requires of publicly financed projects. 
Under Lombardo’s bill, builders needn’t pay prevailing wage if “the qualified borrower demonstrates that the qualified project addresses a need for critical infrastructure in an area with a shortage of attainable housing.”
Tina Frias, the CEO of the Southern Nevada Homebuilders Association argued that state prevailing wage requirements “make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for home builders to construct attainable homes.”
“We’re willing to sacrifice construction workers,” said Las Vegas Democratic Assemblymember Max Carter, admonishing the provision. The state is “willing to let them work for substandard wages. In fact, incentivize them working for substandard wages.” 
Reno Democratic Assemblymember Erica Roth pointed to two housing projects that received funding from the Nevada Infrastructure Bank.
“Both of those projects use prevailing wages and both of those projects didn’t have trouble securing financing or penciling out,” she said. 
Despite the bill’s language exempting the prevailing wage, Cherry said it was not the intent “to be presented this way.”
“I will be clear and on the record for this committee that Governor Lombardo does support the use of prevailing wage on projects across the board,” he said. 
Labor groups, including the AFL-CIO, and progressive groups, including Battle Born Progress, also opposed the bill’s provisions prevailing wage exemption.

Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, speaks to a colleague on the floor of the Alabama Senate on April 3, 2025 at the Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery, Alabama. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)​​The Alabama Senate Thursday passed a bill expanding the pool of people who can claim a religious exemption from vaccines and allowing them to do so without explanation.
SB 85, sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, extends the existing religious exemption requirements from parents of K-12 students to college students. It also would not require either to provide or explain the reason for the exception or have it certified or approved by local school boards. The legislation also mandates that public colleges and universities provide both religious and medical exemptions if they require students to be vaccinated or tested for diseases. The bill passed 26-5.
Orr said during the floor debate the current system creates unnecessary hurdles and potential costs for parents exercising their religious beliefs, saying that roughly half the states allow a similar exemption process.
“It’s not a discretionary function. It is a mandatory function that they have to give you the religious exemption paper. So, why are we doing that? Let’s just let parents affirm that they have a religious exemption,” Orr said to reporters after the Senate adjourned.

Several Democrats raised concerns about public health and the potential spread of disease. The state’s measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination rate fell below 94% in 2022-23. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 95% of the population needs to be immunized to achieve herd immunity.
Sen. Robert Stewart, D-Selma, said that the state has historically “worked hard as a state, as a country, to have strong, robust infection control. He said that “when we talk about religious freedom, we have a duty to keep our communities safe.”
“Public health is a community project, and we should all work together to ensure that our communities are healthy, are viable,” Steward said.
Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, proposed an amendment requiring a person claiming a vaccine exemption to submit a board-approved physical evaluation form or the Alabama High School Athletic Association’s Preparticipation Physical Education form. The amendment does not provide an enforcement mechanism or sanctions for not submitting the form. The amendment was approved 21-7, 
“At least it gives us an understanding that this child has had some medical attention within the last 12 months prior to them opting out of this particular vaccine,” Singleton said. “If they don’t want to take it to go to school, at least the school now you’re bypassing the health department.” 
But Sen. Tim Melson, R-Florence, wanted the bill to go further and questioned the focus solely on religious exemptions.
“Why do you have to have a… religious exemption? Why can’t it just be a conscientious objection? What are the agnostic people going to do? What are the atheists going to do if they don’t want to do it?” Melson asked Orr.
Orr said that he “would agree” but that he doesn’t think that providing conscientious exemption to vaccines, often referred to as a personal exemption, would pass either chamber.
“It would be more of an uphill challenge than it already is,” Orr said. “So I would love to do that if I were king for a day, but I’m not king.”
Sen. Merika Coleman, D-Birmingham, said she was concerned about removing the Alabama Department of Public Health’s role in tracking exemptions. She said that when there may be outbreaks, health departments will be less equipped to trace a potential virus.
“My fear is when we don’t leave it there at the health department, then we’ll never be able to find out where patient zero is and if there is some type of outbreak, how to be able to bring it under control,” Coleman said.  
A similar version of the bill passed the Senate last year but failed in the House.

A bill before state lawmakers seeks to increase Medicaid funding for patients treated at university clinics in Nevada, and help alleviate the mental health provider shortage in the process, supporters say.   
“I know that we are serious about improving access to mental health care in Nevada, and we must be equally serious about how we train and sustain the professionals who provide it,”  Dr. Michelle Paul, executive director of UNLV Partnership for Research, Assessment, Counseling, Therapy and Innovative Clinical Education (PRACTICE) told lawmakers last week. “I won’t overemphasize the point. I think everyone knows Nevada ranks among the lowest in the nation for access to quality mental health care. We’re last for child mental health and the current workforce supply cannot meet the demand.”
University-based training clinics play a critical role in trying to fill in the gap, Paul said. “We provide high-quality evidence-based care directly to community members, while also providing the training necessary. But we do so on limited funding.”
Currently, a graduate student who works with a child and family for one hour is reimbursed by Medicaid for that hour. 
“But beyond that hour, they had an hour of supervision. They had an hour of how to assess suicide risk,” Paul said, explaining the current reimbursement scheme “doesn’t help us provide the infrastructure and support behind quality training. Clinics already serve Medicaid recipients, but are financially unsustainable under fee for service rates.” 
Senate Bill 353 creates a category for university clinics that provide counseling services to the public. The legislation creates two per diem reimbursement rates – one for psychiatric residents, and another for non-medical trainees such as marriage and family therapist graduate students.
The rates are in line with research from Washington state, which is also seeking to establish a reimbursement model for university training clinics.   
The proposed reimbursement model would require $255,103 from the state in the next biennium, which begins July 1, in addition to $417,340 from federal Medicaid funding over the two years. 
Enhanced reimbursement rates have existed for decades for medical education, Paul told lawmakers.
The legislation would allow clinics to leverage their services “in a smart, scalable way,” Paul said, adding the effort “represents more than a technical adjustment to reimbursement policy. It is an innovative and vital step toward building the workforce we need while ensuring access to quality care for the most vulnerable.”
“Medicaid is the single largest payer for mental health services in the United States, and remains a critical pathway to accessing health care,” state Sen. Marilyn Dondero Loop, a Democrat from Las Vegas and one of the bill’s sponsors, testified last week before the Senate Committee on Commerce and Labor. “Access to mental and behavioral health services for Medicaid enrollees is a fundamental aspect of the mission of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, ensuring that all individuals have access to receive necessary support for their overall well being.”
UNLV PRACTICE has an annual budget of $675,000, and provides 6,500 hours of mental health services a year while training 30 graduate students, Paul said. 
The clinic has served more than 6,000 community members and trained 300 graduates since 2012, said Dondero-Loop, who is sponsoring the legislation along with Sen. Edgar Flores and Sen. Rochelle Nguyen, also Democrats from Southern Nevada. 
The clinic’s patients have a 67.5% overall improvement rate, compared to 21% in routine care settings, Paul said via email. 
“Our clinics reach hard to serve populations,” Paul testified, adding UNLV PRACTICE provides telehealth services to middle and high school students in Elko and Humboldt counties. “We also see children and Spanish-speaking families and individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, but the standard reimbursement fails to account for the additional supervision, infrastructure and time needed in training clinics.”

(Courtesy of New Jersey Governor's Office)State officials say they are reviewing a new letter from the Trump administration threatening to pull federal education funding if all schools have not eliminated diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.
In the Thursday letter, the federal Department of Education told state education commissioners that they must certify that all K-12 schools are not engaging in any programs to “advantage one’s race over another.” The use of DEI initiatives could violate federal law, the Department of Education says.
Spokespeople for Gov. Phil Murphy and the state Department of Education say they are mulling what the state should do next.
“We are aware of the U.S. Department of Education’s letter to the New Jersey Department of Education, and we are evaluating the state’s options,” said Murphy spokeswoman Maggie Garbarino.
State Department of Education spokeswoman Laura Fredrick, meanwhile, said the department is “reviewing this latest communication to determine appropriate next steps.”
The federal Department of Education sends more than $1 billion annually to New Jersey K-12 schools.
New Jersey has thousands of schools in nearly 600 school districts. The Trump administration letter directed states to collect certifications of compliance from all school districts within 10 days and return them to the feds. The certifications note that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 allows the federal government to withhold folding from districts that engage in racial discrimination.
Craig Trainor, the federal Department of Education’s acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said in a statement that “federal financial assistance is a privilege, not a right.”
“When state education commissioners accept federal funds, they agree to abide by federal antidiscrimination requirements. Unfortunately, we have seen too many schools flout or outright violate these obligations, including by using DEI programs to discriminate against one group of Americans to favor another based on identity characteristics in clear violation of Title VI,” Trainor said.
President Donald Trump campaigned for the White House on a pledge to eradicate all public and private DEI initiatives.
New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin vowed to fight any attempt to “take away this critical funding.” Platkin’s office has filed numerous lawsuits against the Trump administration, targeting everything from Trump’s executive order on voting restrictions to his administration’s attempt to cut $600 million in teacher training grants.
“Threatening federal funding for our schools, and especially our low-income and special needs students, is cruel and reckless,” he posted on social media.
Appearing at Montclair State University last month, Platkin defended DEI initiatives.
“Remember, DEI stands for diversity, equity, and inclusion. Diversity, equity, and inclusion alright? This is not radical stuff. This is not indoctrinating everyone. It’s saying everyone gets treated fairly. By the way, that’s also what state and federal law says,” he said.
Federal officials warned states in February that funds would be rescinded in schools using DEI in admissions, hiring, scholarships, and other aspects of student life.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Under an emerging Republican plan to require some Medicaid recipients to work, between 4.6 million and 5.2 million adults ages 19 to 55 could lose their health care coverage, according to a new analysis.
The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.
“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.
Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility.
U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.
The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.
Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Medicaid-work.jpg,,,2025-04-04 11:09:16.864129

Bob Ferguson will hash out in the final weeks of the legislative session.
Washington’s wealthiest individuals, largest corporations and biggest banks are prime targets. Homeowners, vapers and self-storage unit renters are among those who could share in the burden. Possible tweaks to expand the state’s capital gains tax could also be in play. 
“There will be a tax increase,” House Speaker Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma, said Wednesday. “It’s figuring out the right kind of balance and making sure we’re able to not harm everyday Washingtonians.”
A day earlier, Ferguson threw cold water on House and Senate Democrats’ desire to tax those with more than $50 million. He said the tax is “untested, difficult to implement, and most importantly, for purposes of adopting a sustainable budget, will face an immediate challenge in court.” 
Ferguson said he could, however, tolerate such a tax if the take is tiny, just to have its legality tested. But a drastically slimmed version of the so-called wealth tax won’t raise anywhere near what Democrats say is necessary to close a wide budget gap and stave off harsh cuts.
Notably, Ferguson did not express dissent on other revenue-raising measures under discussion, such as hiking taxes on large businesses and financial institutions, a new payroll tax and lifting the 1% cap on annual increases in property tax collections by the state. 
These are all means Democrats are eyeing to fill a budget hole the governor pegged at $16 billion.
Republican legislators were glad the governor dissed the wealth tax but disappointed he didn’t go further.
“I wish he had also pushed back against the Democrats’ property-tax increase, as that will take billions upon billions from families of all income levels — but maybe it will be next,” Sen. Nikki Torres, R-Pasco, said in a statement.
Staking out their positions
Fans and foes of the Democrats’ efforts argued their cases at lengthy hearings in the Senate and House this week. They’ve also intensified their direct lobbying of party leaders and budget writers, knowing it’s crunch time. 
Leaders of Washington’s most-recognized corporate giants signed onto a letter Wednesday opposing new business-related taxes and warning of severe economic consequences if companies and jobs start decamping to less expensive states.
“Given national economic trends, Washington state cannot sustain continued tax and spending increases and simultaneously maintain our economic resilience and competitiveness,” reads the letter sent Wednesday to Ferguson and leaders of the four caucuses.
More than 60 executives — including those from Amazon, Costco, Microsoft, Nordstrom, T-Mobile, the Seattle Mariners and Weyerhaeuser — signed on.
Rachel Smith, president and CEO of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, which helped put together the letter, said Thursday that political leaders at all levels of government need “a reality check” or they’re risking a recession.
“Whether you want to tax the rich to be righteous or enact tariffs to drive an ideological policy goal, we need to ask ourselves: when has kamikaze economic policy ever worked?” she said.  
Jinkins took umbrage at Weyerhaeuser’s participation, telling reporters company representatives have sat in her office and told her “we’re never leaving this state.”
Supporters have focused on the importance of Democrats’ proposals as a needed corrective to a tax system in which those with lower incomes pay a greater percentage of their earnings in taxes. 
The tax hikes will sustain vital services and move the state closer to carrying out its paramount duty of funding basic education for public school students, they’ve said.
“The governor and legislative leaders have all said that our tax structure is too regressive. Now is the time to help us close this budget shortfall while preserving public schools and essential services for our community,” said Larry Delaney, president of the Washington Education Association, a teachers’ union.
The big taxes
Democrats in the Senate and House have teed up four major proposals. Hearings were held this week on all of them, but no votes are planned until Democrats decide which to pursue.
One is the wealth tax targeting about 4,300 people. Each chamber has its own approach.
In the House version, there would be a tax of $8 on every $1,000 of assessed value of certain financial assets such as stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds, and mutual funds. The tax would only apply to the value of these assets that is above $50 million. 
Senate Democrats want to set the tax rate at $10. They also want to tax the full value of the covered assets if a person has more than $50 million of them. In other words, if you have $51 million of these assets, Senate Democrats would apply the new tax on all of it, while the House would only tax the $1 million.
Both chambers want to erase the 1% cap on increases in the annual property tax growth for the state’s common schools levy and for cities and counties, as well as special purpose districts.
The Senate replaces it with one based on the combined rate of population growth plus inflation. There would be no cap. The House also moves to a rate based on population growth plus inflation, but sets a cap of 3%. Both assume the state property tax limit will be uncapped but local governments would not make a change without voter approval.
A third major proposal is a Senate-backed statewide payroll tax. Employers would pay a 5% tax on payroll expenses above the Social Security threshold — currently $176,100 per year. This tax is limited to companies with $7 million or more in payroll expenses — about 5,289 businesses. It’s modeled on Seattle’s JumpStart tax. Critics point to employers who have shifted jobs away from Seattle after the city imposed its levy.
House Democrats are eyeing a permanent 1% surcharge to the business and occupation tax rate on businesses with taxable income over $250 million. About 370 businesses would be affected. The same bill would increase the surcharge on financial institutions with annual net income of $1 billion or more from 1.2% to 1.9%. This will impact about 250 businesses.
Wait, there’s more
Budgets passed in the House and Senate relied on billions of dollars from the wealth tax to balance. Ferguson’s comments have them casting around for other ideas.
“There are other revenue options out there,” Jinkins said Wednesday, including eight to 10 business tax possibilities. 
“There are capital gains,” she added without elaborating. Washington imposes a 7% tax on gains over $270,000 from the sale or exchange of long-term assets like stocks, bonds and business interests. Democrats in December looked at the possibility of upping it to 9% or having a higher rate for gains greater than $1 million.
The Senate has a bill to repeal 20 tax exemptions considered obsolete or ineffective. These include carve-outs for gold bullion and prescription drug wholesalers. 
This week, the House Finance Committee is expected to advance a bill expanding definitions of “moist snuff” and “tobacco products” to include those containing nicotine. That would make them subject to the state’s tobacco products tax and net $25 million a year. Next week the committee will consider a bill that could raise the price of cigarettes and vape products.
Bills to tax storage units, which could generate a similar amount each year, and increasing the advanced computing surcharge paid by large technology companies, are lurking. The latter legislation could bring in around $200 million a year.
“It’s clear we have work to do in negotiating a compromise that leads to a budget and revenue package that works for Washington families,” said House Finance Chair April Berg, D-Mill Creek.

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)The state prisons board on Thursday approved sending out a request for general contractors to submit proposals to build a new prison in Franklin County.
According to documents provided to the board, the Department of Corrections will begin advertising the request on April 8, with a deadline for submitting proposals on April 22. 
The department is aiming to receive approval from the Division of Building Authority in June. Also in June, the department plans to bring the project to the Arkansas Legislative Council for review.
Early sitework is proposed to start in September, with the start of construction for the planned 3,000-bed prison in January 2026. 
The board also voted to appoint an executive committee to review the proposals and oversee the overall design process for the prison.
The executive committee will have “approval and decision-making authority” in the interest of making decisions about the proposed prison “expeditiously,” according to documents provided by the board.
“These decisions will not carry cost impacts until we have designed to the approved budget,” a document about the committee read. Department of Corrections spokesperson Rand Champion said committee members would be selected later.
Arkansas Senate rejects prison appropriation bill for second time

The committee will submit the designs for each design phase to the Board of Corrections for approval. Once the budget is finalized, any changes that would impact the cost by more than $250,000 would require additional approval from the board, something that board chair Benny Magness expressed satisfaction with.
“That’s more than adequate to me,” Magness told officials from Vanir Construction Management Inc., which the board retained to oversee the firm selected to build the prison.
The board did not spend long discussing the prison, but briefly talked about utilities — specifically, how drinking water and wastewater service would be established for the prison, which is proposed for a rural part of Franklin County. Opponents of the prison site have criticized its selection for a lack of adequate infrastructure.
Vanir officials discussed potentially building pipelines to bring in drinking water from Fort Smith; a wastewater pipeline is receiving similar consideration. Meetings with the city of Fort Smith about the matter would be happening on Friday, said Mike Beaber, the regional director for Vanir. Being able to pipe wastewater to Fort Smith instead of building a treatment facility on-site would allow builders to “put that money back into” the prison.
“Nothing is off the table,” Beaber said.
A $750 million appropriation bill needed to fund the prison’s construction failed to pass the state Senate for the third consecutive day Thursday.
In addition to the Franklin County prison, the board also raised the budget of a bed expansion at a work-release unit in Mississippi County by $4 million, which brought it up to $6.3 million. It had originally approved a $2.3 million budget in 2022, but multiple changes in the design have led to delays. The original budget called for adding 50 beds; the project now calls for 100 beds.
“We’ve still done nothing?” Magness asked. A department official confirmed that was the case.
Now, the estimated cost of the planned expansion is $5.6 million.

Session deadlines — including for the next two-year budget — also approach.,"House Speaker Todd Huston (left) and Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray answer reporter questions in scrums held Thursday, April 27, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana’s property taxes will return to the spotlight next week, with key lawmakers refining their message Thursday. And deadlines — including for the next two-year budget — are coming up as the end of the legislative session approaches.
Both House Speaker Todd Huston and Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray told reporters last month that they wanted Hoosiers’ 2026 property tax bills to be less than their 2025 property tax bills. But how much less?
They got more specific with reporters on Thursday, after behind-the-scenes negotiations with each others’ chambers and with Gov. Mike Braun.
“My goal is to have over 50% of people pay less in ‘26 than they did in ‘25,” Huston said. “I think it’s coming together, and we’re working at it.”
Bray similarly said that “most people” would pay less.
Major details
Huston outlined an ambitious target: he said homesteads — or primary residences — would see a “90-plus percent reduction” in “what people would have been paying in taxes.” Spokeswoman Molly Gillaspie later clarified he meant that over 90% of Hoosiers would pay less in property taxes next year.

Huston added that lawmakers would provide more than $1 billion in relief for property taxpayers over the next three years.
Bray said the Senate hoped to “help the people that need it most,” like those with fixed incomes.
His chamber originated the property tax plan in Senate Bill 1. The House will unveil its take on the legislation Monday at a House Ways and Means Committee hearing.
Braun has previously threatened to veto Senate Bill 1 if it doesn’t provide enough relief.
Asked if he was concerned the governor wouldn’t be satisfied with lawmakers’ efforts, Bray replied, “We’re hopeful that he’ll see real value in where we’re at, but we all have a position we have to stake out.”
More to come
Huston also signaled that a contentious bill forcing some public school districts to share property tax revenue with charter schools may be folded into the property tax plan. He said the merge “would make sense to me.”
In addition to major work on property taxes, the Senate must act this week on the state budget. The two-year, $46 billion spending plan in House Bill 1001 must get out of committee by Thursday, April 10 to meet a key session deadline.
Republicans control the House, Senate and governor’s office, so the trifecta’s goals for the budget are generally aligned.
Some larger issues involve funding for traditional K-12 public schools; increased spending on private and charter schools; Medicaid cuts; economic development spending; and the fate of a public health initiative.
All bills must pass the full House and Senate chambers by April 15.
The rest of the session, which must end by April 29, will be spent negotiating final compromises. Lawmakers are hoping to finish by April 25 to avoid coming back after a weekend.
“That’s the goal. You guys have met us, so that’s the goal,” Huston told reporters.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)In a sweeping immigration bill designed to help President Donald Trump enact his mass deportations of unauthorized immigrants, the Florida Legislature earlier this year repealed a 2014 law allowing individuals brought to the U.S. as children without documentation, known as “Dreamers,” to pay in-state tuition rates at Florida colleges and universities.
That abrupt change will affect approximately 6,500 undergraduates, according to the Florida Policy Institute.
When the measure went before the Florida Senate in February, South Florida Democrat Jason Pizzo offered an amendment to grandfather in any dreamer enrolled in a state college or university so they could continue pay that in-state tuition for an additional four years.
It didn’t pass.
Advocates aren’t giving up, though. This week, the group TheDream.US trekked to the Capitol to resume the fight. Specifically, they hope to revive the idea of allowing students now enrolled to continue paying in-state rates until they graduate.
“Right now, they’re working on the budget, and we know that the budget needs to pass, right?” said TheDream.US president and CEO Gaby Pacheco.
“And so it could be a potential vehicle for us to get a grandfathered-in clause. The hope is that the House as they’re working through this perhaps put in an amendment. We’re not legislators, so we don’t necessarily know the ins and outs. We’re just hoping that they know that this is important for the state of Florida, for their constituents, for these students and our college systems.”
Pacheco made regular visits to the Capitol in 2023 to defend against the threatened cutoff of in-state tuition for dreamers. Gov. Ron DeSantis announced before that legislative session a slate of proposals cracking down on illegal immigration.
Yet, somehow, the law survived that year. It wasn’t the first time that some Republicans in the Legislature had attempted to repeal the measure. But after last year’s election, in which illegal immigration was a central issue, DeSantis made it clear to state lawmakers at the beginning of this year that he wanted the law struck down.
‘Everything that I’ve fought for’
Among those joining Pacheco in the Capitol this week was a 20-year-old student from the University of Central Florida who wanted to be identified only by her first name of Callie, out of fear she could be targeted because of her immigration status.
She’s a junior majoring in advertising and public relations who has accumulated 80 credits toward her degree and says that will be up to 100 by the end of the spring semester — not enough yet to graduate.
But as of July 1, when the law takes effect, she’ll be forced to pay full tuition. “That means I can no longer afford my public education and will have to give up everything that I’ve fought for,” she said.
In addition to her studies, Cailie works between 20 and 36 hours a week at Publix and spends her free time volunteering to help students prepare college scholarship applications. Her tuition is roughly $2,800 a semester, covered through a scholarship from TheDream.US. It will more than double after the law takes effect — an amount she says she can’t bear.
Cailie, 20, migrated to the United States from Haiti almost seven years ago. Her parents aren’t supporting her, she said, as she was forced to leave home at 16. Her rough upbringing compelled her to try to make a better life for herself but, without the benefit of in-state tuition, “it’s impossible.”
She spent part of Tuesday meeting with lawmakers to explain her plight, although she knows it’s an uphill battle.
“It’s hard to get people to change their mind, so all we’re asking for are the current students to be grandfathered in and protected for now,” she said. “Because most of us only have a few more credits to go, and it’s so unfair that we had to fight so hard to get here and just knowing that all of a sudden it meant nothing? That’s hard.”
Cailie’s ambition is to start her own business helping other students from low-income families get educations like she’s been able to achieve — for now, anyway.
“I want to be a role model to show them that I come from an undeveloped country, that I didn’t have the same opportunities as everybody else, and I made it, so it’s possible. The U.S. is a country of opportunists, but now I’m wondering if that’s even true anymore.”
Pacheco acknowledges her group has limited leverage with the Legislature, but believes it’s worth the effort.
“At the end of the day, we’re practically begging,” she said. “We’re saying, ‘Please do not do this to these students. Please do not do this to 6,000 young people who have worked so hard to get so far, and that are so close to be able to get those college degrees.'”

(Photo by Karen Ducey/Getty Images)Emma McDonnell has one of those jobs it takes a few minutes to explain. She’s a biomedical informatics researcher in the University of Washington School of Medicine. But that doesn’t really explain what she does, even if you know what informatics is. Her research is centered on making health care and medical technology accessible to people with disabilities. 
Her Ph.D. and master’s degrees were in human-centered design, a field she describes as highly interdisciplinary. I just call it very cool. Human-centered design is something we didn’t know we needed until we had it. I predict the results of her research will become known to most of us someday because it is so essential. Consider the needs of the elderly, people who may not have grown up with disabilities but gain them as time goes on.
This isn’t a story celebrating McDonnell and her work. Unfortunately. This is a column about how she and other young researchers like her are wondering if they will be able to build a science career in a nation led by anti-science, anti-DEI politicians. And it’s about how that could have lasting consequences when it comes to advances in medicine and other fields. 
McDonnell is considering redirecting her research focus so she can attract federal grants when her training is complete, or just moving her career in an entirely different direction.
The Trump administration has demonstrated, through executive orders and other edicts, they do not want the U.S. government to support research that focuses on diversity, equity and inclusion because those topics do not help the majority of Americans (their words, definitely not mine).

McDonnell reminded me: DEI is not just about race and ethnicity, it’s also about accessibility. 
She is in the first year of a two-year postdoctoral fellowship at UW, paid for by the National Library of Medicine, a division of the National Institutes of Health, a federal agency that has been ordered by the president to cut research grants. McDonnell is definitely not the only UW postdoc worried about their future right now. UW has about 450 postdocs in the School of Medicine, nearly all of them paid by dollars from the federal government.
The University of Washington is one of the top research universities in the country. This is underscored by the amount of research dollars they get from the federal government. Federal dollars make up 55% of all university research dollars nationally. UW is No. 5 nationally in its spending of this money, according to the National Science Foundation. That money pays for labs and people across the university, not just the School of Medicine.
While McDonnell is part of a national program focused on making health care more efficient, her part of the research is clearly about accessibility. Health disparities that people with disabilities face were declared a focus last year, when Joe Biden was president — and not telling NIH what to do. Now, unfortunately, that area is a target instead of a priority.
“None of us are really sure what it will look like having a career in this very important work if it’s basically banned from the top,” McDonnell told me.
The cuts have begun
The first cuts in government research dollars were around projects on gender and climate, but disability and accessibility are on the list. 
Donald Trump has made it clear that he is ready to punish any university that allows students to express their First Amendment rights too vociferously. Cutting federal research dollars is one way to go about that, as the U.S. government is the main source of funds to pay for expensive labs and the people who work in them. 
Columbia, the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard and Stanford have already been targeted. I expect UW, where students protested the war in Gaza for months last year, could be too. The Department of Education, in early March, included the university on a list of 60 it says were under investigation for antisemitic harassment and discrimination, warning of “potential enforcement actions.” 
About 1,900 scientists, all members of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, recently called the Trump administration’s research cuts a “wholesale assault on U.S. science” in an open letter, saying the cuts threaten the health and safety of Americans.
Research cuts at UW have begun around both DEI-related topics and vaccine hesitancy, according to Shelly Sakiyama-Elbert, vice dean for research and graduate education, in the University of Washington School of Medicine.
“We’re definitely concerned,” Sakiyama-Elbert said. “We’re seeing a lot of delays in rewards, in next year’s funding, without much explanation.”
She said they’ve experienced delays in both the review process and the issuing of new grants. And the termination of current grants has also begun. The process is fluid, so Sakiyama-Elbert couldn’t give an exact dollar figure for the cuts, but if you add in the research where UW is a subcontractor, the losses are already in the millions for just the School of Medicine. 
The School of Medicine is also concerned about the NIH proposal to cut grants for indirect costs, which pays for research facilities and other overhead, to 15%. The current UW standard is 55.5% campus-wide, which is pretty standard nationwide. A cut like this would result in an estimated decrease of $91 million for just the School of Medicine, Sakiyama-Elbert said. That NIH proposal is tied up in the courts after Washington state and others sued to stop it. 
“With so much uncertainty, we just don’t know how big the impact is going to be,” she added, noting that the toll might also be seen 10 or 20 years down the road, when needed scientific discoveries don’t materialize. 
The human impact
Cutting the university’s overall research budget is a big financial concern for UW administrators, but Sakiyama-Elbert says the real worry is what will happen to young researchers like McDonnell. UW has already instituted a hiring freeze which means fewer doctoral students and postdocs will be able to get jobs in research labs. 
She believes the brain drain could happen at three points in the process of training future scientists: from undergrad to graduate school when students decide to pursue a different career, from graduate school to Ph.D. programs when some future scientists will be turned away because of a lack of funding, and from postdoc to professorships when jobs may be limited. 
A similar brain drain happened during the 2008-2010 recession when research money was also cut. What scientific discoveries were delayed or never happened because some postdocs never pursued their research ideas? Which medical advances will be delayed this time? 
While McDonnell could pivot and work in another part of human-centered design for a few years and see if the climate for accessibility research improves, she doesn’t want to do that. She is passionate about her work and her brain is filled with ideas for future research. She also recognizes her place as a role model for other students like her.
“I identify as disabled. I want to be at a place where my disabled students feel safe,” she said. So far, the University of Washington is a place like that and has been for a long time, with a strong computer science focus on accessibility, for example. 
UW is also a place where many international students come to learn and research and both McDonnell and Sakiyama-Elbert are concerned about their international colleagues. 
“We’ve really benefited from having such brilliant and creative people wanting to come to the United States,” Sakiyama-Elbert said. She’s heard about potential international brain drain: American students and postdocs saying they are going to look outside the U.S. for postdoc fellowships and faculty jobs. The uncertainty is scary for these folks, she added. 
Cutting federal research grants could deal a variety of hits to individuals and the Washington economy, because UW is just one place where federal dollars are fueling science, paying for construction and funding scientific research.
“My intent for myself is I’m going to save my panic for July, which is when I have to start looking for jobs,” McDonnell said.
For the rest of us, who will benefit from the research McDonnell and her colleagues do – or don’t do – the time to panic may be further off. Most people don’t realize how long it takes to develop a cure to cancer or an effective treatment for Alzheimer’s. Four years of eroding federal support could delay life-saving treatments for decades.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/uw-medicne-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-04 07:04:03.242188

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)If Indiana were to start from scratch and legalize casino gambling today, we obviously wouldn’t leave out the state’s two largest population centers.
That’s why I am intrigued by a bill that would study casino reorganization — from the transfer of an existing, underperforming license to potentially adding a new license.
Senate Bill 43 was the result of a failed attempt to move the Rising Star casino in southern Indiana to New Haven, just outside of Fort Wayne. The intense opposition stopped that idea, but led to the next one.
The legislation requires the Indiana Gaming Commission to contract out for a study to identify two regions where a license could locate, which could add a 14th license to the mix.
Honestly, I think the state needs a much broader study looking at gambling overall.
Since Indiana legalized the lottery in 1988, lawmakers have approved virtually every other gambling option you can think about. Riverboat casinos (which have since moved onto land); racinos (which started out as slots at the horse tracks and now are full-fledged casinos); sports betting; charitable gambling; and low-stakes gambling at bars.
iGaming proposal for lottery and casinos dead for the session

All of these are cannibalizing each other at some point. Not to mention the interactive online gambling that casinos and the Hoosier Lottery are seeking. That bill also stalled this session.
Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, called the study “incredibly shortsighted” in an opposing speech from the Senate floor last month.
“If we are really going to look at this, instead of doing this piecemeal, then let’s really look at our gambling revenues,” Brown said. “… If we care, then we should have an honest look at our gaming revenue that we’re seeing. Whether it’s horse tracks, whether it’s the sports betting or whether it’s the on-the-ground casinos.”
“It’s a Jenga game. They all need to be looked at in a fix,” Brown added.
But alas, we will stick with the current discussion.
I understand that when gambling started in Indiana, lawmakers chose to put facilities near state lines to attract gamblers hailing from other states in which it wasn’t legal. But it’s a different world now.
It makes no sense that the Indianapolis and Fort Wayne areas don’t have casinos — if, indeed, the goal is to maximize tax revenue to the state.
An amendment made to Senate Bill 43 acknowledged this, by narrowing the study from three regions to two.
Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, said any “serious conversation” about a license needed to include his hometown, adding that the southeastern casino was “dying.”
“If the purpose of gaming is revenue, why there is not a casino in downtown Indianapolis defies my understanding,” Freeman said. “Because it would support all of our tourism, all of our big games, all our industry. Everything in Indianapolis — it would support it.”
Some Indiana gambling operators have said this is destabilizing. And, of course, if you move a license to Indianapolis, it will impact the number of people from central Indiana willing to drive to the racinos in Shelbyville or Anderson. Same for Fort Wayne.
But I think lawmakers need to look at the overall health of the industry and taxes brought to the state, rather than individual operators. According to annual reports by the Indiana Gaming Commission, gaming and sports wagering operations brought in $691 million in taxes in fiscal year 2022. That dropped down to $655 million in fiscal year 2024.
Maybe the answer is fewer licenses overall, but placed for maximum impact. Maybe a study would find we need to go all in on more expansions. Or maybe we are right where we need to be. We need to think bigger, and consider what’s best for all of Indiana.

He ended up deported, sent back to Mexico, a country the 39-year-old Kansas husband and father left at the age of 4.
“Everything was approved, and I arrived here with no problem,” said Cortez Martinez, a DACA recipient, in a phone interview from Cuernavaca, a city south of Mexico City.

On March 23, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials stopped Cortez Martinez at the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport as he presented documents to board a flight back to Kansas City.
He was held, questioned and put on a flight to Mexico City that evening.
“I asked them, ‘Can I just call my lawyer and try to see if I can work things out,’” Cortez Martinez said. “They said, ‘No, you don’t have that option.’”
His attorney argues otherwise, filing a case Wednesday, April 2, with a Texas federal court.
“How many others are out there that this has also happened to, but who didn’t have the ability to get counsel?” said Rekha Sharma-Crawford, the Kansas City-based attorney who filed the case in the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Texas. “The law is on his side.”
 Potential test case

The case could become a test of the limits of the Trump administration’s reach.
Advocates argue the administration’s zeal to deport is increasingly overstepping, scooping up immigrants, even those legally present, and not allowing due process.
The lawsuit seeks “declaratory, injunctive and mandamus relief to find that Defendants actions were arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”
It’s filed against the U.S. Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and other government officials.
U.S. Immigration officials do not generally comment on specific cases.
But in a statement released to NPR recently, Customs and Border Protection argued it was merely enforcing the law.
“Those who violate these laws will be processed, detained, and removed as required,” CBP Assistant Commissioner Hilton Beckham said in the statement.
Customs agents in Dallas told Cortez Martinez that he had been ordered removed in absentia on June 11, 2024, and that his documents to travel had been issued in error.
Cortez Martinez said he had never been notified of a removal order, which is the legal term for what most people colloquially refer to as deportation.
The Roeland Park, Kansas, resident is staying with the one Mexico relative he knows, an uncle.
Cortez Martinez is believed to be the first Kansas City-area case of a DACA  (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipient caught in the Trump administration’s vow to deport millions of people.
The latest Trump plan is called Operation Take Back America.
The lawsuit argues that Cortez Martinez has the right to appear before an immigration judge.
“Under current regulations, a holder of an Advance Parole document cannot be barred from the country (removed) without a formal removal hearing before an Immigration Judge,” the suit states.
Advance parole is the process Cortez Martinez went through, with the aid of an attorney, to travel outside of the U.S. as a DACA recipient.
His recurring two-year renewals of DACA had been approved by the government like clockwork. His current DACA is valid until October 2026.
DACA was designed by the Obama administration in 2012. It was meant to be a carveout for immigrants known as “Dreamers,” those who’d been brought to the U.S. as young children, without legal status.
DACA is a temporary reprieve from deportation. It also allows for work authorization and for people to apply for travel outside of the country, through advance parole.
The removal order the government cited is from June 2024.
“He’s not hiding, Sharma-Crawford said. “He’s doing everything that he’s supposed to be doing.”
Cortez Martinez has lived in the Kansas City area for nearly 20 years.
His wife, child and stepchildren are anxiously waiting for his return to their suburban home.
 Rising immigrant fears of being deported

Cortez Martinez’s case is the first deportation of a Kansas City-area DACA recipient that Nubia Estefes is aware of occurring.
“It’s one of our fears,” said Estefes, executive director of the Kansas Missouri Dream Alliance, an advocacy group for “Dreamers.”
Before Trump took office, a few other area DACA recipients traveled back to their birth nations on the same documents that Cortez Martinez used, advance parole.
The trips were taken with counsel by attorneys, to ensure that nothing could be resurrected in their history as a rationale for deportation, Estefes said.
“It’s personal discretion on the part of the officers,” she said of the scrutiny that occurs at Customs.
News stories that even documented people have been deported are alarming the immigrant community.
“We’re definitely siding with the cautious side,” Estefes said. “If you don’t have to go, if it’s not life or death, I would suggest you wait it out.”
El Centro, a Kansas social service agency, is also advising immigrants to be careful.
Justin Gust, vice president of community engagement, said the agency is continuing the help with DACA renewal applications.
But even immigrants who are legal permanent residents are being advised to take precautions, especially when traveling.
“It just seems like everything is unknown these days,” Gust said. “What was a protected status, or a protected issue, is no longer protected.”
People are disabling face recognition or a thumbprint to open their cellphone, as a safeguard against having their data combed for anything a customs agent might deem offensive to the Trump administration’s goals.
“We’re advising people that they really do need to talk to their lawyer first and don’t go just to go, because you definitely need to know that you can come back,” Gust said.
 A beloved grandfather, hazy memory of Mexico

Cortez Martinez’s sole memory of his native Mexico is a limited one, possibly bolstered more by family stories than a true memory.
But his grandfather is central.
Cornelio Martinez Dominguez owned a panaderia, a bakery.
“I’ve been told that every time the bread was ready, I’d run to my grandpa,” Cortez Martinez said.
Through the years, he spoke with his grandfather by phone. But he’d never returned to Mexico.
Sharma-Crawford first contacted the CBP Watch Commander at the Dallas Fort Worth airport, seeing if the office would intervene.
She did not receive a reply.
“There are real questions if he was properly notified,” she said of Martinez’s order of removal.
Still, the existence of the order wouldn’t negate his right to be granted advance parole, she said.
Sharma-Crawford suspects that the Trump administration has begun re-calendaring removal cases that had previously been closed.
“I never got any notice,” Cortez Martinez said of the removal order. “I never got any citations to go see a judge.”
Cortez Martinez received the approval to travel from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in early March. The document is valid until April 14, 2025, according to the lawsuit.
Still, he had been initially hesitant to take the trip.
He only considered doing so, as his grandfather’s health worsened.
In November, his grandfather died before the paperwork was approved.
The visit was shortened to a three-day excursion, just enough time to reach the cemetery a few hours outside of Mexico City, and then return to Kansas City.
“That’s the grandpa I wanted to be able to say goodbye to,” Cortez Martinez said.

Joanne C. Benson (D-Prince George's) praises Sen. Charles Sydnor III after his emotional speech before the Senate voted to approve the Second Look Act on Thursday. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Just hours after the Senate approved the Second Look Act, the House on Thursday quickly accepted Senate amendments to the bill that gives a second chance to long-serving incarcerated individuals and sent the measure to the governor for his signature.
It capped months of debate of emotional, and often personal, debate on House Bill 853, which critics said would bring needless new suffering to victims of crime, but supporters said would provide a deserved second chance to those in prison who had turned their lives around.
The Senate on Wednesday, by a one-vote margin, approved an amendment that would make the Second Look Act unavailable to anyone convicted of killing a first responder in the line of duty.
That cleared the way for the Senate to approve the bill 31-16 and sent it back to the House, which had approved the bill two weeks ago, on an 89-49 vote. House members voted 89-47 for the amended bill Thursday night and sent it to the governor.
Del. Cheryl Pasteur (D-Baltimore County), the lead sponsor of the House bill, was not a fan of many of the amendments the bill picked up along the way, but said after Thursday’s vote that “you have to start somewhere.”

“No one is born into this world or wakes up in the morning to think about doing evil or doing wrong to other people,” Pasteur said.
“I am looking forward to these people who are willing to be out in our communities, helping some of these young people who feel alone and abandoned … Now some of these people will be able to make a difference in their lives,” she said.
Del. Gabriel Acevero (D-Montgomery) said the bill is about protecting those who are prison, but who are innocent.
“This is about people who languish in our state prisons for decades for a crime they didn’t commit,” Acevero said. “Where is the compassion for them? Where is the justice for those folks? I heard none of that from the minority party in the entirety of the debate on this bill. This is what you call legislating for the innocent.”
House Minority Whip Jesse Pippy (R-Frederick) responded, telling Acevero, “I always enjoy when you get up.”
“You just made an assertion on the floor that every single person locked up for killing someone, killing a kid, killing police officers are all innocent, according to your speech … So, I take offense that,” Pippy said looking Acevero’s direction.
“We have folks that have done very bad things and they’re incarcerated for it, and we don’t want those individuals getting out and revictimizing a whole bunch of other people,” Pippy said.
Under the bill, some people who have served at least 20 years of a prison sentence could petition the court for a sentence reduction. That option would not be available to someone sentenced to life without the possibility of parole or to a sex offender — and, after the Senate amendment, to someone convicted of killing a first responder, like a police officer, firefighter or paramedic.
The bill had already been narrowed once from the version Pasteur had drafted, limiting the second chance in the act to those convicted of a crime they committed between the ages of 18 and 25.
An individual who appeals to the court for a reduced sentence and is denied would have to wait three years before filing another petition. Prisoners could file up to three petitions, but “an individual may not file a fourth motion to reduce the duration of the sentence,” according to the bill.
Sen. Jack Bailey (R-Calvert and St. Mary’s), who voted against the bill Thursday, sponsored the Senate amendment Wednesday to put the act out of those convicted of killing a first responder “in the line of duty.” That amendent passed on a slim 24-23 margin.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Senate Minority Whip Justin Ready (R-Frederick and Carroll) said people convicted of violent offenses who had harmed others ‘on purpose” could receive a second look under the bill.
“We’ve done a lot to try to reform the criminal justice system in this state. This body, I think, has gone too far,” Ready said during Thurday’s nearly 25-minute debate in the Senate. “These were people convicted as adults of very serious crimes. They should not get a second look that’s really a 17th or 18th look.”
The bill’s supporter have long said that it is not a get-out-of-jail-free card for what opponents call the worst of the worst, but something for those who have really turned their lives around.
Sen. Charles Sydnor III (D-Baltimore County), defended the bill Wednesday, highlighting how courts can assess several factors to determine whether someone incarcerated has earned a reduced sentence. Some factors would include a person’s age at the time of offense, demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation and that person’s family background.
On Thursday, Sydnor stood in the Senate and highlighted that all victims’ families “are not a monolith.” He began to choke up when he recalled the summer of 1991, when his cousin was shot in the head.
A few years ago, Sydnor said a session ended to honor another cousin who suddenly died around Sydnor’s birthday.
“The story goes in my family he died of a broken heart. His brother was murdered,” Sydnor said while choking up. “If these people, whoever committed those crimes, showed that they did what they needed to do to reenter society, I’d welcome them with open arms. As I said yesterday, this is about grace. I stand on that.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sens.-Charles-Sydnor-III-and-Joanne-C.-Benson-4-3-2025-1024x760.jpg,,,2025-04-04 07:04:03.242188

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)As I sat in my oldest brother’s room at Moses Cone Hospital in Greensboro, listening to the alarm shriek that his oxygen levels were critically low, I kept batting away intrusive thoughts about the federal budget battle happening hundreds of miles away in D.C. None of the Washington policymakers in their fancy suits could possibly understand the position my family was in, seeing Medicaid dollars go toward making my brother more comfortable in the last minutes of his life.
Medicaid has been essential for multiple people in my family, but in particular my oldest brother. To call his health care needs complicated would be an understatement. He was born with Osteogenesis Imperfecta, also known as brittle bone disease. His birth parents originally thought he wouldn’t survive due to fracturing most of his bones during the birthing process. But he survived and, due to numerous factors, his birth parents relinquished their parental rights. 
He was sent to live in a pediatric nursing home. My parents adopted him at the age of four, and he grew up receiving orthopedic care through the private insurance my father received through his job at UNC-Greensboro. In high school, his care grew more complicated as he was diagnosed with other physical, mental health, and developmental disabilities, and my parents tried to help him transition into adulthood. They wanted all their children to enjoy as much independence as possible, and my older brother was no exception. 
There was a lot of back and forth on where my brother would live as an adult. Eventually, it was decided he could be most independent at an assisted living facility. And for a while, that seemed to work out. However, after a year at the facility, he had multiple major medical issues, physical and mental, that threw that decision into question. My parents gained medical guardianship over him and were able to obtain a Medicaid waiver that allowed him to live in the community with a care attendant. And while his medical situation remained difficult over the years, we always knew we could count on Medicaid to help provide the care he needed to remain as independent as possible. 
It felt ironic to see congressional Republicans once again jeopardize Medicaid at the same time that my brother was on a ventilator fighting for his life. Because of Medicaid, our choices surrounding my brother’s emergency hospitalization and end-of-life comfort care were not hampered by concerns around expenses. Without Medicaid, our experience would have been much more difficult. Almost three million North Carolinians are covered under Medicaid, with a 2023 expansion allowing an additional 470,000 people to be covered in the first seven months. The state spent $27.8 billion to provide critical healthcare to those who needed it under Medicaid last year and received $18.9 billion from the federal government.
After my brother’s passing, I think about those still receiving life-saving care through Medicaid. It’s outrageous to think congressional Republicans want to line millionaires’ pockets with money that’s helped North Carolinians like my brother receive life-sustaining care, including two million people who live in districts governed by the same elected officials who are pushing for these cuts. 
As the disability community continues to grow, it’s imperative that Congress refrain from these harmful efforts to cut or limit benefits via burdensome proof of work, block grants, or lifetime caps. All the suggestions congressional Republicans have made to “reduce costs” through Medicaid will leave more disabled people dead, homeless, or institutionalized. 
Shame on them.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/medicaidsign-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-04 07:04:03.242188

(Getty Images) (This image cannot be republished unless you have a Getty subscription.)The Environmental Protection Agency has long been a favorite target of the budget knife, but a new looming threat is different in magnitude and impact.
The Office of Research and Development has long been the nerve center of the EPA, generating the critical research behind the action.
Under a proposed agency plan unveiled last month, the Office of Research and Development would be cut and over 1,100 scientists would either lose their jobs or be reassigned to positions in other places.
In Oklahoma, this office is located at Robert S. Kerr Environmental Science Research Center in Ada, and would be liquidated under the plan. Canceling it would be like removing EPA’s brain and just hoping that the limbs of the body still know what to do.
Many EPA administrators or Interior secretaries have been hostile to environmentalism, but current EPA head Lee Zeldin takes it to a new extreme. He wants to cut the agency’s existing $10.9 billion budget by 65% and has announced the “biggest deregulatory action in US history” with 31 policy proposals designed to roll back Obama and Biden policies on climate change, environmental justice and tribal consultation.
If someone accidentally dumped 2,000 gallons of diesel fuel right next to your city’s water supply, you would rightly be extremely concerned that your water would become contaminated and maybe people would become ill. If the diesel got into an aquifer, that water might be ruined for thousands of years and the very existence of the city would be threatened.
It’s actually the Robert S. Kerr Environmental Science Research Center that helps state and federal officials figure out how to respond to such environmental disasters.
Kerr Lab is the sole federal groundwater research lab in the country. One of its tasks is to do research on the characterization and remediation of ground water. Because of the research performed at Kerr Lab, when disaster strikes, first responders have research on what to do. Strategies have been tested in the lab and again under real world conditions.
It is very hard to get people to care about groundwater when they can’t see it or drive their boat on it. But when our groundwater becomes undrinkable, I am sure people will wonder what happened.
Oklahoma is a leader in water science because of former U.S. Sen. Robert S. Kerr’s vision. Kerr, also a former Democratic Oklahoma governor, perceived the state’s water related opportunities and had the political leverage to act upon these needs. Through his urging in the U.S. Senate, the Kerr Lab was built in 1966 in Ada after the passage of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1961. The EPA was authorized in 1970 and groundwater became the lab’s focus in 1979.
The Kerr Lab made more history in 2024 when it became the first EPA lab in the country to sign a memorandum of understanding with a Native tribe, the Chickasaw Nation. A hydrologist was recently hired under this plan to research aquifers of interest to the Chickasaw Nation and the State of Oklahoma.
Kerr called his revelation about the importance of water to Oklahoma “the flood of conviction” which occurred at Muskogee in 1943. The Arkansas River flooded, killing 26 and washing away crops and topsoil. The damage was over $31 million. As governor, Kerr promoted farm pond construction and 66,700 ponds were built between 1943-1947 for flood control. The concept of “leaky ponds” is one that EPA scientists in Ada are still working on regarding aquifer recharge research. Kerr envisioned a research mission to solve problems, not just analytical labs.
As director of the Water Resource Policy and Management masters of science degree at Ada’s East Central University, I regularly collaborate with Kerr Lab. Eliminating the Office of Research and Development would shame Kerr’s legacy and deprive Oklahomans and Americans from needed groundwater research.
It is actually not clear how eliminating the Office of Research and Development would be accomplished because it was created by statute. Only Congress would be able to eliminate the office. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) calls the move illegal.
In any case, one thing is for sure, the 76 EPA employees in Ada set to be fired or reassigned are watching the news very closely. Let’s hope our state and federal officials are doing the same.

City officials said during a Thursday morning press conference that 249 students and their siblings have been tested since January. Three schools remain closed including Fernwood Montessori School, Starms Early Childhood Center, and LaFollete School, while four other schools which were previously closed have been re-opened. 
MPS also announced that its senior director of facilities director and management is leaving the district, effective immediately. The district is now looking for a new director to help address lead hazards in MPS schools. Sean Kane had been with MPS for 25 years. MPS Superintendent Brenda Cassellius thanked him for his service during the Thursday morning press conference at the MPS Administration Building. 
“I will immediately begin a search for a permanent replacement to lead the district,” said Cassellius, adding that Michael Mannan, the Milwaukee Health Department’s director of home environmental health, and Mike Turza, a retired MPS employee who was re-hired in March after nine years of retirement are assisting during the transition. Turza was brought onto Cassellius’ transition team to help with an operational audit requested by the governor’s office.

Kane has become a central figure in the MPS lead contamination controversy. While working as facilities director, Kane had failed to keep his architecture license current. In March, the state Department of Health Services issued a letter blasting lead remediation work done by MPS employees overnight at Fernwood Montessori. The letter said that 11 employees conducting the lead remediation may not have been trained to do so, and that students had been allowed back into classrooms which were still contaminated. 
“We must move forward with a plan that everyone has confidence in, that everyone trusts, and that puts the wellbeing of our students and staff at the forefront,” said Cassellius. Mayor Cavalier Johnson was also in attendance, and praised the collaborative efforts between MPS, the health department and the state government, as well as MPS leaders’ care and attention to families. “There’s nothing, absolutely nothing more important than the health and wellbeing of kids in Milwaukee,” said Johnson. “We recognize that there are issues, and we are actively working to address those issues with keeping the health and again, the wellbeing, of kids at the forefront.” 
This week, Kane was fined $1,319 by the state Department of Safety and Professional Services for violating state law, and misrepresenting himself as an architect since his license lapsed nearly five years ago. While his license was invalid, Kane was appointed facilities and management director in October 2021.
Cassellius wouldn’t comment on personnel matters involving Kane. During the Thursday press conference, however, Milwaukee Health Commissioner Dr. Mike Totoraitis said, “I never want to see anybody lose their job or their role, however I do think at this moment, it was warranted to help move us into this next step.”

Totoraitis also answered questions from media about emails showing that Kane did not allow health department staff into Golda Meir School to do a full lead risk assessment, and did not disclose that lead remediation work was ongoing after a student was found to have lead poisoning. “I was frustrated,” said Totoraitis. “Our team was also ready to send a staff of about eight individuals and lead risk assessors to go to the schools. We were ready to work that weekend.” 
The health commissioner said that 249 students and their siblings have been tested for lead poisoning. Others have received  routine screening at pediatric offices. Totoraitis also said “we have pivoted” from using dust swab samples inside buildings to using a checklist and visual inspection — which he said is outlined in state statute — “to ensure that we are quickly assessing the schools, as opposed to doing the dust wipe samples which usually take a week and a half to get processed.” In some cases, Totoraitis said that ceiling and floor tiling is being checked and sealed to prevent lead intruding into the schools. 
A plan to tackle the lead contamination has been drafted and officials said it will eventually be released to the public. Testing and screening of students will continue, “because that’s the best way for us to determine if children have been poisoned or not,” said Totoraitis. 
In late March, Totoraitits said that the city issued a formal request to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for additional assistance, and had received federal assistance in recent months. Mass layoffs in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and funding cuts by the Trump administration have put additional assistance in question. 
On Thursday, Gov. Tony Evers highlighted a plan to tackle lead contamination in his weekly radio address. The plan includes over $300 million to fund initiatives aimed at removing lead service lines contaminating drinking water and supporting lead renovation programs. Childhood lead contamination has been linked to cognitive disorders including degraded impulse control, learning disabilities, and violent behavior. About 85 MPS schools were built before 1970 and are therefore at high risks of lead contamination.

The letter is signed by the endowment&#8217;s [&#8230;]","The Idaho Humanities Council funded a project for the Hagerman Valley Historical Society Museum in 2024 to compile 434 veteran biographies for those living or buried in the region.

""Hagerman Valley Military Appreciation Project."" (Courtesy of David Pettyjohn)The National Endowment for the Humanities, a federal agency, has abruptly cut funding for humanities projects in Idaho.
On Wednesday, the Idaho Humanities Council — alongside all other state humanities councils across the country — received a letter notifying it that its federal funding was cancelled, effective immediately. The letter is signed by the endowment’s acting chairman. 
“NEH has reasonable cause to terminate your grant in light of the fact that the NEH is repurposing its funding allocations in a new direction in furtherance of the President’s agenda,” the letter reads. 
The funding cancellation is a part of a wave to cut federal spending under the Trump administration. The move strips 75% of the Idaho Humanities Council’s budget, council executive director David Pettyjohn told the Idaho Capital Sun. In addition to reducing funds for salaries, administrative costs and outreach efforts, the federal funding cuts threaten grants for history, literature and art projects across the state. 
“This grant is a five-year grant, and we were just awarded it,” Pettyjohn said. “We receive funding each year, and last year it was about $930,000.”
Pettyjohn said the federal funding is incredibly important for Idaho, especially as it prepares to celebrate the country’s 250th anniversary since the signing of the Declaration of Independence next year.
“We are uniquely positioned to bring Idaho together to discuss our past,” Pettyjohn said. “The humanities transcend politics. It is what brings us together. It is what helps us find common ground. We have been incredibly proud of our ability to successfully do that for over 52 years, and the cancellation of this funding puts that at severe threat.”
 The role of the Idaho Humanities Council

Established in 1973, the Idaho Humanities Council is a nonprofit. It does not receive state funding, but relies on private funding and grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities.
Idaho officials join America250 initiative to celebrate the founding of the United States

The national endowment is the largest public funder of humanities projects in the U.S., awarding $6 billion to humanities across the country since 1965. The federal agency supports museums, historic sites, universities, teachers, libraries, filmmakers, radio stations, scholars and other humanities programs. 
Between 2020 to 2023, the federal agency gave more than $5.7 million to the Idaho council and individual projects. 
With support from the federal funds, the council funded projects in 27 out of Idaho’s 44 counties in fiscal year 2024, ranging from projects highlighting veterans living in the Hagerman Valley, programs and exhibits at the Boise Art Museum, and speaker events across the state. 
Federal funding also allows the council to bring Smithsonian exhibits to Idaho. 
“It is something that only state humanities councils are able to do in partnership with the Smithsonian traveling exhibit service,” Pettyjohn said. “Most of us don’t have the opportunity to travel to D.C. and actually be at the Smithsonian, so in order for the Smithsonian to come to these communities, they have designed exhibits that fit in small spaces and it does not cost the community a thing.” 
This year’s exhibit was supposed to open in July in Burley, Moscow, Coeur d’Alene and end in Priest River. But now, those plans are now on pause — along with all other programs and grants — as the council is determining the validity of the letter, Pettyjohn said. 
“We have been completely compliant with everything NEH has asked of us in the last 52 years of our existence, and all of my fellow councils have been the same way,” he said. “This was really unexpected.”
 Remaining grant cancelled for local professor leading Treasure Valley history project 

Rachel Miller, a history professor at the College of Idaho, received a letter on Thursday that the remaining funding for a history project she received in 2023 from the National Endowment for the Humanities was cancelled. 
For more than a year, Miller has led a project with the help of her students to create an oral history project called the “Voices of the Treasure Valley.” The goal of the project is to collect the stories of people who have lived in southwest Idaho and experienced its rapid change over the last few decades. 
“We are creating materials that will be available to everyone, and we are helping to build a state archive that represents recent history, which is maybe not always what we think of when we think of documenting Idaho’s history,” Miller told the Sun. 
Though she used most of the $25,000 in funding already, she said cutting projects like hers limits access to humanities, making them available only to those with a lot of resources. 
“This grant really made humanities education available to students who probably wouldn’t otherwise get it, and it really bolsters humanities programs at institutions that really need it,” Miller said.  
With the grant, Miller was able to give her students experience outside of the classroom, connecting them with community members who have witnessed historical change. The funding supported field trips, the hiring two student interns and the purchase of recording devices for high-quality audio. The grant also allowed Miller to compensate community partners who shared their time and expertise. 
“If we don’t support the humanities, I think we are saying something really destructive about our belief in the importance of getting to know each other as humans,” Miller said.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A bill that would prohibit transgender female athletes from playing on college teams that align with their gender identity passed the Indiana Senate on Thursday with bipartisan support on a 42-6 vote. 
It now goes to Gov. Mike Braun for his signature.
Sen. Stacey Donato, R-Logansport, sponsored House Bill 1041, painting it as a “common sense” measure “that ensures female athletes have a fair and equal playing field.”
“This bill is about maintaining the integrity of women’s sports and the scholarships (of) these women who train and work to be an athlete,” said Donato in her closing remarks. 
Democrats disputed Donato’s characterization of fairness, noting that the bill does nothing to ensure equal pay for female coaches or address disparate funding. 
Furthermore, Democrats argued that the bill was unnecessary since the National Collegiate Athletic Association, Trump administration and Braun administration have all enacted their own policies barring transgender female athletes from playing on college teams. 
“(The bill) is yet another example of unnecessary language that serves no other purpose than to remind someone that they are ‘other.’ That they are not accepted here. That their own (elected) representation looks down on them,” said Sen. J.D. Ford. “… I think we should be better than this and I think Hoosiers deserve better.”
Legislation from the 2022 session barred transgender female athletes from playing in K-12 sports. 
 Bill discussion from opponents

Ford and another Democrat, Minority Senate Leader Shelli Yoder, blasted the bill for a lack of protections for accused students from harassment. 


The six Democrats voting against House Bill 1041 are: 

Sen. J.D. Ford, Indianapolis
Sen. Andrea Hunley, Indianapolis
Sen. La Keisha Jackson, Indianapolis
Sen. Fady Qaddoura, Indianapolis 
Sen. Mark Spencer, Gary
Sen. Shelli Yoder, Bloomington



“Women who work really hard — spending their lives training tirelessly to be an elite athlete — will be accused of being trans because their work has made them too bulky or too muscular or not feminine. And all it takes is one person to point that out and (they’ll) have complete immunity,” Ford said. 
Such accusations have already occurred on the Olympic level, notably with Algerian boxer Imane Khelif, he said. 
Yoder piled on, naming several coaches around the state who had been sentenced for sexually abusing their athletes, including the infamous Larry Nassar, who abused over 100 female gymnasts.
“There is no language that protects against genital inspections, forced disclosure of medical history or invasive questioning by coaches or school officials. There is nothing in (House Bill) 1041 to stop a coach, athletic trainer or administrator from asking a student to prove their gender. Nothing,” said Yoder, of Bloomington. “What is in this bill is the license to discriminate. A license to sexually harass. And we’ve seen what happens when adults in positions of authority abuse that power.”
Instead, Yoder said the bill would invite more scrutiny and endanger students who don’t otherwise fit into a mold — such as intersex students, who are not mentioned in the bill’s language. 
 Support from Republicans

Republicans who spoke on the bill saw otherwise. 
Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, shared her experience playing on college teams as an athlete. She said she practiced with the man, used the same equipment, ate the same food and stayed in the same hotels. 
“I don’t want to compete against a man. There are certainly women who I competed against who were far superior to me, but I knew I had, literally and figuratively, a fighting chance,” Brown said. “… The only reason we’re passing this bill now is because opportunities are being taken away from women.”

She and other Republicans pointed to viral videos of female athletes getting injured playing against a transgender female volleyball player or wins from transgender female swimmers. 
Sen. Spencer Deery, R-West Lafayette, specifically targeted a statistic from the NCAA president, who told a Congressional panel that there are “fewer than 10” transgender athletes on college teams. 
“It may be 10 today, but I assure you: if we look the other way, it will not be ten tomorrow,” said Deery.
In an impassioned rebuttal, Sen. Chris Garten said the examples of sexual harassment had “nothing to do with” House Bill 1041, naming female athletes harmed while playing. 
“This is us taking a stand and protecting girls from injuries in competitive sports against biological males,” said Garten, R-Charlestown. 
None of the supporting Democrats spoke on the bill.

The measures are sponsored by Carpenter-Grantham’s District 20 representatives, Montgomery County Democrats Sen. William C. Smith Jr. and Del. Jheanelle Wilkins, and co-sponsored by Dels. David Moon and Lorig Charkoudian, among others.
Carpenter-Grantham and his mother, Linda Carpenter-Grantham, traveled to Annapolis last month, when the House and Senate approved both measures in their respective chambers on the same day.

It’s very rare where you get a story, where you can start from a small seed of an idea, and then it grows to like an actual piece of legislation that’s going to impact a lot of people.”
PFAS bills presumed dead
A bill that would have banned certain PFAS chemicals from pesticides in the state is dead for this year after environmental groups and safety advocates pulled their support, the sponsor of the Senate bill said.
The groups initially backed the bills, House Bill 386 and Senate Bill 345, which would have banned the sale of pesticides containing PFAS, chemicals that have been linked to serious health issues and are known as “forever chemicals” because they are extremely slow to break down in the environment and the body.
But the groups reneged after the definition of PFAS compounds was narrowed in the legislation, a change that was backed by some pesticide manufacturers. Under the amendment, PFAS would need to have two fluorinated carbon atoms, a departure from state law, which currently requires only one.
Advocates worried that more-narrow definition could be used in other areas of state law dealing with PFAS. That disagreement ultimately sank the bill, said Sen. Benjamin Brooks (D-Baltimore County), who sponsored the Senate version.
“The supporters of the bill, they are just that entrenched, that they just cannot go with the double carbon,” Brooks said. “So, it would be better to hold off for this session — maybe even next session — and come back.”
It’s the second high-profile PFAS measure to stumble in the closing weeks of the legislative session. Senate Bill 732 and House Bill 909 would have limited PFAS levels in the sewage sludge that comes from wastewater treatment plants, and is often applied to farm fields as fertilizer. But lawmakers said they could not reach agreement with treatment facilities.
Bonnie Raindrop, coordinator of Maryland’s Smart on Pesticides Coalition, said she was grateful to hear that the pesticide bill’s shrunken PFAS definition would not advance into law. She is fearful that President Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency will soon consider the narrowed definition at the request of chemical industry groups.
“We are glad that they won’t be able to point to Maryland and this bill as a justification for ‘harmonizing’ the definition to the 2-carbon definition,” Raindrop said in a statement.
Senate amends health education bill
The Senate Education, Energy and the Environment Committee had issues with some of the content of House Bill 161. How much of an issue? The committee’s amendment struck everything between “Section 1. Be it enacted” on the first page to “Section 2. And bi itfurther enacted” on the final page.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXHB161 once prohibited parents from opting their children out of required age-appropriate instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity, drawing scathing criticism from House Republicans who argued that those discussions are best held at home, not in the classroom.
The Senate amendmments, filed Wednesday, remove all the controversial provisions. Now, the bill simply affirms that counties must align their curriculum to state standards and creates a process to correct county curriculum if it is out of alignment with those standards.
The Senate voted to approve the committee amendment Thursday morning, overhauling the legislation and removing the required instruction on gender identity and sexual orientation language in the process. It gave final approval to the amended bill laterin the day, on a 33012 vote.
“The committee saw an opportunity to … create a broader and clearer process,” Sen. Mary Washington (D-Baltimore City and Baltimore County) said when defending the legislation later Thursday. “While this started in one place, it sort of highlighted a different broader issue and frankly … it wasn’t really clear what locals could do if there was some disparity or discrepancy.”
The initial version of the legislation arose in response to a Carroll County school board decision to remove certain curriculum related to LGBTQ+ issues. The House has passed versions of the bill to boost instruction on gender identity and sexual orientation, but those efforts have fallen short in the Senate so far.
Minority Whip Justin Ready (R- Frederick and Carroll) said Thursday that he appreciated the changes to the bill, although he ultimately voted against it.
“I appreciate that this bill was not moved forward in the way that it came over, because as it was, I think it would not have been the right move for the state,” Ready said.
“The genesis of this legislation, which has been about an ongoing three-year saga, has been a disagreement about what’s appropriate for different age groups in the context of sexuality and family life,” Ready said. “Now the bill tried to do a lot of things that are not in the bill anymore …  I do appreciate that a very egregious part of the bill, which was going to try to say that parents couldn’t opt their children out of some of that instruction at all, was struck from this bill.”
Despite the heavy amendments, Senate Republicans still voted against the bill Thursday. It now goes back to the House, which will have to decide whether it will accept the changes and send it on to the governor, or let the bill die.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Jheanelle-Wilkins-Eric-Carpenter-Grantham-and-Linda-Carpenter-Grantham-cropped-e1743753745317-1024x732.jpg,,,2025-04-04 07:04:03.242188

(Photo by David Montgomery/Stateline)WATER VALLEY, Texas — On a recent day when the wind gusted close to 40 miles per hour, 82-year-old George Neill was making repairs on his ranch, oblivious to the nearby cluster of wind turbines churning the sky behind him.
“After about a year, you never know the things are here,” said Neill, who leases part of his West Texas property to an East Coast-based renewable energy company that placed three wind turbines on it four years ago.
Hundreds of other wind turbines stretch across this landscape, instantly visible to motorists traveling to nearby San Angelo and other towns. The turbines aren’t the only renewable energy producers amid the mesas: From a distance, a glistening array of solar panels resembles a small lake.
Texas is famous for producing oil and gas, but renewable energy has become deeply embedded in the state’s culture and economy. Texas led the nation in generating electricity from wind power and utility-scale solar power in 2023, and wind and solar energy projects contribute tax revenue to local governments and struggling school districts. Texas landowners are expected to receive nearly $30 billion in lease payments under current and expected projects, according to an industry study.
But in recent years, Texas has loosened its political embrace of alternative energy. For the second legislative session in a row, many Texas lawmakers are trying to derail or curb future renewable energy projects.
The shift is rooted in a number of a factors, including the second Trump administration’s antipathy toward renewables and an aggressive recommitment to fossil fuels in Texas energy policy. There is lingering concern over the reliability of the state’s electrical grid, after all types of power sources failed during a devastating 2021 winter storm. Some people object to the aesthetics of wind and solar farms, or note that turbines and panels can harm some wildlife.
Texas is not alone. Once focused on stopping individual projects at the local level, renewable energy opponents have been making inroads in other state legislatures, too. They have received backing from the oil and gas industry. And they’ve been galvanized by the 2022 passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest-ever attempt to speed the transition to clean energy.
In neighboring Oklahoma, for example, hundreds of people rallied at the state Capitol in January to urge Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt to issue an executive order halting new wind and solar projects. Like Texas, Oklahoma is a major oil and natural gas producer, but it generated 45% of its total in-state electricity from renewable resources in 2023.
Stitt, a strong supporter of renewable energy, is highly unlikely to issue such an order. But he will leave office in two years, and several Republicans discussed as possible successors appeared at the rally. One of them, Attorney General Gentner Drummond, last month on social media criticized what he called “the green energy scam” and urged Stitt and state lawmakers to tighten wind farm rules during the current session.
In Arizona, the House earlier this year approved a bill that would bar wind farm projects within a dozen miles of any property zoned for residential use — a restriction that would apply to about 90% of the land in the state, according to an analysis by the Arizona Republic.
In Ohio, a 2021 law allowing county commissioners to create restricted areas where utility-scale solar and wind projects can’t be built has had a huge impact, as 26 Ohio counties have banned renewable energy projects. This year, GOP lawmakers have introduced legislation that would end all state solar subsidies.
And in Missouri, Republican legislators are pushing a bill that would raise taxes on farmers who lease their land for wind or solar energy projects.
The expanding opposition to renewables isn’t unexpected, said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin who studies the power grid. He noted that wind, solar and battery storage have rapidly become the “cheapest way to put more energy on the grid.”
“They’re victims of their own success,” he told Stateline. “They are relatively new players to the market, so there’s going to be pushback from incumbents.”
 Opposing sides

At the center of the current debate in Texas is state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican committee chair who has resurrected a 2023 bill that would require new utility-scale solar and wind projects to get permits from the state’s Public Utility Commission, regulations that aren’t imposed on projects for natural gas and other energy sources. The bill also calls for set-back requirements and cleanup funds.
Kolkhorst, in a statement to Stateline, called the legislation “a common-sense approach to the encroachment of wind and solar facilities being scattered across our great state with no consideration or safeguards for landowners or the environment.”
At an hourslong Senate committee hearing recently where opponents of Kolkhorst’s bill outnumbered supporters, farmers, ranchers and small-town Texans sometimes found themselves on opposite sides, either arguing that sprawling wind farms and solar arrays are a lasting source of economic vitality or a threat to a beloved way of life.
“The land isn’t just a piece of property to us,” said Laurie Dihle, who lives on 154 acres in Franklin County with her husband. “It’s our home, our sanctuary and a big part of who we are. When we look out across the road, we see rolling green pastures and trees. Now we’re facing the possibility of that view and so much more being replaced by a sprawling solar farm.”
Environmentalists and industry representatives view Kolkhorst’s bill as a roadblock in the march toward green energy. Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas, said the bill would open the door to “a really arbitrary discriminatory permitting regime,” requiring wind and solar developers to get permits that other energy producers do not have to have.
Describing herself as a “lifelong wildlife conservationist,” Kolkhorst said she introduced the bipartisan bill with nine other senators in an effort that “looks past the billions in wind and solar subsidies to instead focus on the total impact of these projects on our land, people and wildlife.”
But oil and gas projects also can harm wildlife, and scientists note that the emissions released by fossil fuels worsen climate change disasters.
Insiders following the legislation, including Metzger, identify one of the bill’s major supporters as Kolkhorst donor Dan Friedkin, a billionaire Houston businessman.
Friedkin, chairman emeritus of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission, is owner and CEO of The Friedkin Group, a consortium of businesses and investments that includes Gulf States Toyota. Gulf States is one of the world’s largest distributors of Toyota vehicles and parts, with exclusive rights to sell Toyotas in Texas and four other states. Gulf States Toyota Inc. State PAC made four donations totaling $42,500 to Kolkhorst from October of 2020 to October of 2024, according to the Texas Ethics Commission.
Friedkin is a stunt pilot and outdoorsman with a ranch in South Texas. Neither he nor his lobbyist, Laird Doran, senior vice president for public and legal affairs at The Friedkin Group, returned phone calls from Stateline.
Texas lawmakers have filed dozens of wind- and solar-related bills this session, including measures aimed at restricting the placement of battery storage facilities, curbing tax breaks and subsidies for renewable companies and limiting the amount of electricity solar and wind projects contribute to the state’s power grid.
Republican state Sen. Phil King, for example, is pushing a bill that would mandate that 50% of all new electricity must come from natural gas, nuclear or battery storage. King said solar and wind power should be part of the state’s energy mix, but he claims they aren’t reliable enough to serve as the foundation.
State Rep. Don McLaughlin, a Republican, has introduced legislation mandating a study of the economic impact of wind and solar projects on local communities, as well as noise and health effects, threats to wildlife and the challenges of disassembling worn-out systems. Sweetwater, Texas, has thousands of composite blades piled up in “a windmill graveyard.”
Rural support
But many rural GOP lawmakers whose districts long ago sprouted oil rigs and pump jacks are now strong supporters of wind and solar power.
“It’s nonstop windmills on both side of the road for 70 miles,” said state Rep. John Smithee of Amarillo, describing a typical drive from his hometown in the Texas Panhandle to the Capitol in Austin. “Almost all of those [constituents] have benefited.”
State Rep. Drew Darby, whose northwest Texas district includes San Angelo and Water Valley, an unincorporated community of around 300, said revenue from wind power has resulted in countywide improvements and lease payments to property owners.
“It’s been a positive impact on rural effectiveness,” said Darby. “Landowners … are receiving nice payments for leasing the property.”
In Water Valley, taxes from the increased revenue paved the way for a tax-free bond election that enabled the town’s K-12 school to add an upscale weight room, a technical educational facility and a “cafetorium” that serves as a dining room and performance hall. The school building had previously been so small that students had to eat in shifts.
The wind farm is expected to generate $123 million in local taxes over the 30-year life of the project, as well as more than $100 million in payments to landowners.
George Neill, the West Texas rancher, said he takes the wind turbines in stride as he roams across his 1,700-acre spread.
He’s not at liberty to reveal the amount of his payments. He’s not getting rich, he said, but the money “makes a difference when you’re trying run a ranch.”

Commercial driver’s license (CDL) reciprocity also got the ax, with lawmakers citing immigration-related fears.
Appropriations Committee chair Sen. Ryan Mishler, said the marijuana and towing provisions were nixed — just a week after both were inserted — because they weren’t germane to the underlying agency bill. The edits were accepted by consent.

But both ideas advanced in the House that same afternoon.
Rep. Jim Pressel, R-Rolling Prairie, commandeered Senate Bill 73 in a Monday committee hearing for amendments outlawing all marijuana advertising and regulating towing. He made further changes on the House floor Thursday — despite opposition from fellow Republicans — setting up a contentious vote as soon as next week.
Lawmakers cited illegal immigration as they scrapped a provision allowing CDL holders from other states to get Indiana CDLs without the written or skills exams.
“There are other states in our union that hand out driver’s licenses like candy,” said amendment author Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis. “… I’m fine if they follow the Indiana process to get a license. I am not fine if that process is California’s or New York’s or name your other state’s process, and I wanted to ensure that I didn’t have a non-citizen getting a license.”
Freeman promised to undo the change “if this needs to go back in.”
  Sen. Aaron Freeman speaks in committee on Thursday, April 3, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Pressel said CDL requirements are federal, describing them as another layer of standards that lie atop state mandates. He resisted the amendment, but added, “This is not a hill I’m going to die on. If you all would like to take it out, I’m okay with that.”
The committee adopted the changes by consent. But some expressed hesitation.
CDL holder Sen. Jeff Raatz, R-Richmond noted the tests take “a lot of time and money.”
Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, said her district is a major logistics hub, and would benefit from reciprocity.
She instructed her colleagues to “get this figured out.”

(Jonathan Kult | Wisconsin DNR)
As a teenager in the early 1970s, I recall listening to evening news broadcasts that featured smog reports, along with stories about nearby lakes and streams which pollution had rendered unfit for wildlife — and for humans. Responding to the urgency of that time, members of Congress from both sides of the aisle passed the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, created the Environmental Protection Agency, and began 50 years of progress. These laws and the regulations that came with them required the clean-up of industrial processes, reduced auto emissions and drove energy efficiency. Our natural environment today is better because of it. 
President Trump has never supported policies related to environmental stewardship, let alone climate change. His actions since taking office were expected, but not at the speed and scale we are seeing. He is reneging on federal grants and loans for clean energy projects already appropriated by Congress in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA); firing Federal workers in the EPA, the Department of Energy, NOAA and more; and purging any mention of climate change from government websites. It’s as if his goal is to take us back 50 years to the pollution of my boyhood days.
President Trump’s approach amounts to a colossal strategic mistake for our country. As he and his loyal staff decimate our clean energy investments, European and Asian nations — particularly China – watch with glee. They realize the U.S. is ceding our chance to be a leader in the clean energy economy of the future. The drill-baby-drill mantra sounds catchy to some, but the facts are indisputable that burning fossil fuels is harmful to human health. And there is no question that the severity and number of extreme weather events is rising, shattering lives and costing hundreds of billions of dollars to clean up and rebuild. These are not Democrat or Republican issues; they affect us all and we should be motivated to address them instead of burying our future in fossil fuels.
You may wonder, “What can I do?” Contact your congressional representatives and tell them that the IRA should be left intact, especially the tax credits for clean energy. The IRA has incentivized hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy and manufacturing investments, 80% of which have flowed to “red” states. In Wisconsin, investments have been made in over 40 clean energy and manufacturing facilities totaling over $3.2 billion. In my rural congressional district alone, represented by U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, there are nine projects totaling $1.5 billion in investments, most of which is attributed to the Vista Sands solar project. On top of that, Dairyland Power received a $580 million Empowering Rural America (ERA) grant for clean energy projects.  Another 87 investments totaling $16.5 million have enabled clean energy projects like solar arrays for farmers, rural businesses and communities. And this doesn’t include the 30% tax credits these projects would also have filed for. Over 90 projects in less than two years benefiting our rural community: These are investments to be taken seriously.
Rather than labeling clean energy projects “the green new scam,” the Trump administration should embrace them as a key component of achieving “American energy dominance.” To meet the rapid growth in energy demand to boost domestic manufacturing and to help power AI and data centers, clean energy must be a part of the solution. 
The best way your legislators can serve you is to act in a bipartisan manner, especially when it comes to the environment. Like 50 years ago, urgent action is needed. Future generations of Americans depend on it.

Tim Sheehy, R-Montana, speaks to Kaitlan Collins on CNN about the Trump tariffs, confirming that Americans will feel economic pain (Screenshot CNN). There’s no other way to put it — the insane global tariff war Donald Trump started will have disastrous consequences for our country and international trade across the globe, a flood of which have already begun.  Yet, despite the widely-predicted impacts to many, if not all, of Montana’s economic and social sectors, our all-Republican congressional delegation somehow thinks their partisan loyalty to an arguably deranged president is more important than taking care of their constituents.
Let’s see, do Reps. Ryan Zinke and Troy Downing, Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, think the crashing global stock market is a wonderful thing for Montanans’ retirement investments?  The crashing is indisputable — the DOW dropped a stunning 1,600 points at its first opening after Trump’s tariff tragedy struck.
Yet, all four of these mighty MAGA warriors are as quiet as church mice, hiding in their Congressional offices instead of exercising their Constitutionally-established function as a separate-but-equal branch of government providing checks and balances on executive excesses.  
And make no mistake, this executive is setting new records for abuse of power and lack of respect for and adherence to the Constitution.  Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution vests the power to lay and collect tariffs with Congress...not the Oval Office. 
Which begs the question — why oh why would Montana’s congressional delegation willingly give up that authority when dire consequences for their own constituents are at stake?  
Given that a huge chunk of Montana’s economy is directly dependent upon agricultural production — and the ability to sell those products internationally — who would ever cede control over that complex web of global trade to a guy whose apparent understanding of agricultural production is: “Groceries.  It’s such an old-fashioned term, but a beautiful term: groceries. It sort of says a bag with different things in it.” Or, in his more detailed explanation: “The word ‘grocery,’ it’s a sort of simple word.  But it sort of means, like, everything you eat.” 
For someone who doesn’t even understand what groceries are, how can we expect him to understand that almost everything in every hardware and appliance store in the U.S. is “Made in China” when he slaps a 34% tariff on those imports?  When do you figure the last time Trump bought a garden hose, a dishwasher, refrigerator or even a screwdriver?  “Never” would be the right answer.  And that says nothing about parts for your cars, trucks, tractors, backhoes, appliances…you know, the necessities of life, particularly in a rural state like Montana. 
It’s worth remembering that our GOP delegation has made cutting taxes one of their primary goals.  Yet, according to economists, the new tariff war will be the single largest tax increase on Americans in the last 30 years and “will cost American importers about $2.1 trillion in additional taxes over the next decade, costs that are passed along to consumers, according to a Tax Foundation estimate.”
GOP Sen. Rand Paul has already predicted the tariffs will result in the “decimation” of the Republican Party.  If Montana’s congressional delegation won’t stand up for their constituents as the mass layoffs, price increases, market crashes and economic uncertainty ravage the nation, maybe they’ll at least act to preserve their own political party.  
The Trade Review Act of 2025 has already been introduced in reaction to the Trump tariff disaster.  Montana’s Congressional delegation must cease silently kneeling at the MAGA throne and support this bill to restore limits on a president’s ability to impose unilateral tariffs without congressional approval — or give up the phony charade of protecting the future for Montanans and our nation.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sheehy-CNN.png,,,2025-04-04 07:04:03.242188

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)The countdown to the end of the 2025 legislative session is on. Following a weeklong recess, Arkansas lawmakers hit the ground running Monday as they returned to the state Capitol focused on wrapping up their work by April 16. 
The 11th week of the session saw continued progress on Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ legislative priorities, including immigration. A Senate committee on Monday approved a bill to impose harsher penalties on undocumented immigrants who commit violent crimes. The full Senate sent the bill to a House committee Wednesday. 
On the other side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives approved legislation to overhaul the state employee pay plan, another Sanders priority. The bill was sent to the governor’s desk for her signature. 
Sanders this week unveiled two new bills aimed at expanding social media protections for children, which was a priority in the 2023 session. Wednesday’s announcement came two days after a federal judge declared unconstitutional an Arkansas law requiring age verification for new social media accounts.
Beyond the governor’s priorities, the subject matter of lawmakers’ bills varied widely as they rushed to push their legislation through in the waning days of the session. 
Proposals included potentially removing an environmental permit moratorium intended to protect the Buffalo River watershed, preventing pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from holding permits to operate drug stores, clarifying state public meetings law, adjusting asset limits for Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) beneficiaries and prohibiting youth organizations that promote diversity initiatives from receiving certain state grants.

1) Prison funding
The third time was not the charm for a $750 million prison appropriation bill that was thrice rejected by the Arkansas Senate this week. Senate Bill 354 would support construction of a 3,000-bed Franklin County prison that supporters have said is needed to address overcrowding in county jails. 
The project has caused controversy since local residents and elected officials said they were blindsided by the governor’s announcement of the project in late October. Opponents, including state lawmakers, have fought against the proposal for months. Within the Senate this week, support for SB 354 fluctuated between 19 affirmative votes on Tuesday and Thursday, and 18 on Wednesday.
While that’s a majority of the 35 senators, appropriation bills require 27 votes to advance out of the Senate. There is no limit to how many times lawmakers can vote on an appropriation bill, but they only have until the end of the session to send bills to the governor for final approval. 
It’s unclear if there’s yet a clear path to securing the needed votes by the end of the session, but Corning Republican Sen. Blake Johnson asked his colleagues Wednesday to try and find consensus.
“I appreciate everybody’s differences, but please let’s try to work together for the safety of Arkansas citizens,” Johnson said. 
2) Religious freedom 
Legislation that sponsors said aim to protect Arkansans’ religious freedoms have been popping up on committee agendas in recent weeks. 
The House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday advanced House Bill 1615, which would “prohibit the government from discriminating against certain individuals and organizations because of their beliefs regarding marriage or what it means to be female or male.” The House on Thursday approved the bill, which will next be considered by a Senate committee.

House Bill 1669, which had similar language regarding the “sincerely held religious beliefs” of parents seeking to foster or adopt children in Arkansas, failed in the Senate Monday. The bill’s sponsors, Rep. Mary Bentley of Perryville and Sen. Alan Clark of Lonsdale, said it would protect parents who don’t accept LGBTQ+ children’s identities from not being allowed to foster or adopt.
Searcy Republican Jonathan Dismang, who noted Monday that not all “sincerely held religious beliefs” are Christian, said HB 1669 would set a “dangerous precedent” by shielding foster or adoptive parents from adverse government action if their faith-based actions harm children. 
But the bill received enough support to pass the Senate on Thursday and was sent back to a House committee that will consider an amendment made in the Senate.  
3) Library board
A bill to abolish the Arkansas State Library and its board advanced out of committee Tuesday before narrowly passing the Senate on Wednesday. 
Jonesboro Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan has promised to dissolve the board for some time. With Senate Bill 536 he broadened his intention to eliminate the entire State Library after the board last month did not satisfy the conditions he gave them for its survival. 
One of those requests was to detach from the American Library Association. Sullivan has criticized a section of the ALA’s Library Bill of Rights that says access to libraries should not be restricted based on a person’s age. Far-right conservatives who object to the public availability of certain content have claimed this proves ALA believes in forcing sexual activity and LGBTQ+ topics onto children.

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)
While testifying against SB 536 in committee this week, Clare Graham, library director of the Mid-Arkansas Regional Library System, said the bill’s “one-size-fits-all approach” will stifle creativity and flexibility for local libraries.
“Local libraries are already governed by their local boards that know their communities best,” Graham said. “This bill takes that away, replacing it with centralized oversight that doesn’t understand the unique needs of each town and city.”
SB 536 will next be considered by a House committee.
4) New Bills
Arkansas lawmakers filed about 150 new bills this week. Nearly half were filed Monday as legislators rushed to submit their proposals in what they hope is enough time to make it through the process to become law before their April 16 deadline. Those bills included: 
Senate Bill 591 by Sen. Clint Penzo, R-Springdale, would prohibit a physician or other person from intentionally performing or attempting to perform an abortion with the knowledge that the pregnant woman is seeking the abortion solely based on race. Arkansas law already bans all abortions except to save the life of the mother.
House Bill 1909 by Rep. Wayne Long, R-Bradford, would require state agencies to verify that adults who apply for federal, state or local public benefits are U.S. citizens who reside in Arkansas, except if prohibited by federal law.  
House Bill 1980 by Rep. Jimmy Gazaway, R-Paragould, would create the Technology and Energy for Sustainable Logistics Act (TESLA), and add electric vehicle charging stations to the definition of critical infrastructure. 
House Bill 1985 by Rep. Denise Garner, D-Fayetteville, would create the Arkansas Renter Refund Act, and provide a $500 income tax credit for certain renters. 
Despite the deadline pressure, lawmakers are taking Friday off. When they return to the Capitol early Monday morning, they’ll have roughly seven working days to finish their work. Meeting schedules, agendas and livestreams are available on the Arkansas Legislature’s website.

(Jason Kempin | Getty Images)The nation’s historically Black colleges and universities, known as HBCUs, are wondering how to survive in an uncertain and contentious educational climate as the Trump administration downsizes the scope and purpose of the U.S. Department of Education — while cutting away at federal funding for higher education.
In January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order pausing federal grants and loans, alarming HBCUs, where most students rely on Pell Grants or federal aid. The order was later rescinded, but ongoing cuts leave key support systems in political limbo, said Denise Smith, deputy director of higher education policy and a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a left-leaning think tank.
Leaders worry about Trump’s rollback of the Justice40 Initiative, a climate change program that relied on HBCUs to tackle environmental justice issues, she said. And there’s uncertainty around programs such as federal work-study and TRIO, which provides college access services to disadvantaged students.
“People are being mum because we’re starting to see a chilling effect,” Smith said. “There’s real fear that resources could be lost at any moment — even the ones schools already know they need to survive.”
Most students at HBCUs rely on Pell Grants or other federal aid, and a fifth of Black college graduates matriculate from HBCUs. Other minority-serving institutions, known as MSIs, that focus on Hispanic and American Indian populations also heavily depend on federal aid.
“It’s still unclear what these cuts will mean for HBCUs and MSIs, even though they’re supposedly protected,” Smith said.
States may be unlikely to make up any potential federal funding cuts to their public HBCUs. And the schools already have been underfunded by states compared with predominantly white schools.











There’s real fear that resources could be lost at any moment — even the ones schools already know they need to survive.

Congress created public, land-grant universities under the Morrill Act of 1862 to serve the country’s agricultural and industrial industries, providing 10 million acres taken from tribes and offering it for public universities such as Auburn and the University of Georgia. But Black students were excluded.
The 1890 Morrill Act required states to either integrate or establish separate land-grant institutions for Black students — leading to the creation of many HBCUs. These schools have since faced chronic underfunding compared with their majority-white counterparts.
‘None of them are equitable’
In 2020, the average endowment of white land-grant universities was $1.9 billion, compared with just $34 million for HBCUs, according to Forbes.
There are other HBCUs that don’t stem from the 1890 law, including well-known private schools such as Fisk University, Howard University, Morehouse College and Spelman College. But more than three-fourths of HBCU students attend public universities, meaning state lawmakers play a significant role in their funding and oversight.
Marybeth Gasman, an endowed chair in education and a distinguished professor at Rutgers University, isn’t impressed by what states have done for HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions so far. She said she isn’t sure there is a state model that can bridge the massive funding inequities for these institutions, even in states better known for their support.
“I don’t think North Carolina or Maryland have done a particularly good job at the state level. Nor have any of the other states. Students at HBCUs are funded at roughly 50-60% of what students at [predominately white institutions] are funded. That’s not right,” said Gasman.
“Most of the bipartisan support has come from the U.S. Congress and is the result of important work by HBCUs and affiliated organizations. I don’t know of a state model that works well, as none of them are equitable.”
Under federal law, states that accept federal land-grant funding are required to match every dollar with state funds.
But in 2023, the Biden administration sent letters to 16 governors warning them that their public Black land-grant institutions had been underfunded by more than $12 billion over three decades.
Tennessee State University alone had a $2.1 billion gap with the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
At a February meeting hosted by the Tennessee Black Caucus of State Legislators, Tennessee State interim President Dwayne Tucker said the school is focused on asking lawmakers this year for money to keep the school running.
Otherwise, Tucker said at the time, the institution could run out of cash around April or May.
“That’s real money. That’s the money we should work on,” Tucker said, according to a video of the forum.
In some states, lawsuits to recoup long-standing underfunding have been one course of action.
In Maryland, a landmark $577 million legal settlement was reached in 2021 to address decades of underfunding at four public HBCUs.
In Georgia, three HBCU students sued the state in 2023 for underfunding of three HBCUs.
In Tennessee, a recent state report found Tennessee State University has been shortchanged roughly $150 million to $544 million over the past 100 years.
But Tucker said he thinks filing a lawsuit doesn’t make much sense for Tennessee State.
“There’s no account payable set up with the state of Tennessee to pay us $2.1 billion,” Tucker said at the February forum. “And if we want to make a conclusion about whether [that money] is real or not … you’re going to have to sue the state of Tennessee, and I don’t think that makes a whole lot of sense.”
Economic anchors
There are 102 HBCUs across 19 states, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands, though a large number of HBCUs are concentrated in the South.
Alabama has the most, with 14, and Pennsylvania has the farthest north HBCU.
Beyond education, HBCUs contribute roughly $15 billion annually to their local economies, generate more than 134,000 jobs and create $46.8 billion in career earnings, proving themselves to be economic anchors in under-resourced regions.
Homecoming events at HBCUs significantly bolster local economies, local studies show. North Carolina Central University’s homecoming contributes approximately $2.5 million to Durham’s economy annually.
Similarly, Hampton University’s 2024 homecoming was projected to inject around $3 million into the City of Hampton and the coastal Virginia region, spurred by increased visitor spending and retail sales. In Tallahassee, Florida A&M University’s 2024 homecoming week in October generated about $5.1 million from Sunday to Thursday.
Their significance is especially pronounced in Southern states — such as North Carolina, where HBCUs account for just 16% of four-year schools but serve 45% of the state’s Black undergraduate population.
Smith has been encouraged by what she’s seen in states such as Maryland, North Carolina and Tennessee, which have a combined 20 HBCUs among them. Lawmakers have taken piecemeal steps to expand support for HBCUs through policy and funding, she noted.
Tennessee became the first state in 2018 to appoint a full-time statewide higher education official dedicated to HBCU success for institutions such as Fisk and Tennessee State. Meanwhile, North Carolina launched a bipartisan, bicameral HBCU Caucus in 2023 to advocate for its 10 HBCUs, known as the NC10, and spotlight their $1.7 billion annual economic impact.
“We created a bipartisan HBCU caucus because we needed people in both parties to understand these institutions’ importance. If you represent a district with an HBCU, you should be connected to it,” said North Carolina Democratic Sen. Gladys Robinson, an alum of private HBCU Bennett College and state HBCU North Carolina A&T State University.
“It took constant education — getting folks to come and see, talk about what was going on,” she recalled. “It’s like beating the drum constantly until you finally hear the beat.”
For Robinson, advocacy for HBCUs can be a tough task, especially when fellow lawmakers aren’t aware of the stories of these institutions. North Carolina A&T was among the 1890 land-grant universities historically undermatched in federal agricultural and extension funding.
The NC Promise Tuition Plan, launched in 2018, reduced in-state tuition to $500 per semester and out-of-state tuition to $2,500 per semester at a handful of schools that now include HBCUs Elizabeth City State University and Fayetteville State University; Western Carolina University, a Hispanic-serving institution; and UNC at Pembroke, founded in 1887 to serve American Indians.
Through conversations on the floor of the General Assembly, and with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, Robinson advocated to ensure Elizabeth City State — a struggling HBCU — was included, which helped revive enrollment and public investment.
“I’m hopeful because we’ve been here before,” Robinson said in an interview.
“These institutions were built out of churches and land by people who had nothing, just so we could be educated,” Robinson said. “We have people in powerful positions across the country. We have to use our strength and our voices. Alumni must step up.
“It’s tough, but not undoable.”
Meanwhile, other states are working to recognize certain colleges that offer significant support to Black college students. California last year passed a law creating a Black-serving Institution designation, the first such title in the country. Schools must have programs focused on Black achievement, retention and graduation rates, along with a five-year plan to improve them. Sacramento State is among the first receiving the designation.
And this session, California state Assemblymember Mike Gipson, a Democrat, introduced legislation that proposes a $75 million grant program to support Black and underserved students over five years through the Designation of California Black-Serving Institutions Grant Program. The bill was most recently referred to the Assembly’s appropriations committee.

Michigan posted the largest unemployment rate jump among the 50 states over the past 12 months, the Detroit News recently reported, citing federal Bureau of Labor Statistics data.
The state’s jobless rate rose 1.4 percentage points between February 2024 and last February, the latest month available. The increase exceeded that of second-place Mississippi, which has long been one of the poorest states in the country.
Michigan’s 5.4% unemployment rate in February was second only to Nevada’s 5.8% jobless rate. The state’s unemployment rate is 1.3 percentage points higher than the nation’s 4.1% rate, and the gap has steadily widened over the past year.
But other data paint a somewhat brighter picture of the state’s economy, although they show a slowdown in hiring over the past year. Businesses added 35,000 nonfarm jobs between February 2024 and last February, according to state statistics. Michigan employers also posted 168,285 jobs online in February, although the number was down 2% from January.
The state’s unemployment rate is based on a monthly survey of households while the number of payroll jobs is based on a separate survey of businesses.
People are losing jobs through layoffs, of course. But the unemployment rate also is rising because a surprising number of people entered the job market and couldn’t find employment. Michigan’s labor force has grown by 64,000 over the past 12 months to 5.1 million, while 70,000 people reported being unemployed in February.
University of Michigan economist Don Grimes, who has been forecasting the state’s economy for decades, said the growth in the labor force is notable because of Michigan’s graying population.
“This is a much bigger increase than we understand,” Grimes told me. “Given the aging of the population I would have expected (the size of the labor force) to be trending down, but so far it hasn’t.”
Meanwhile the increased number of payroll jobs over the past year shows Michigan’s economy performed “relatively well,” Grimes said, although manufacturing shed 11,000 jobs.
Grimes regards the payroll data as more reliable than the household survey, but the gap between the two “makes assessing the state’s economy very hard.”
That could become much easier in the months ahead, but in a very negative way.
Experts say President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs announced Wednesday are likely to hike prices on just about everything Americans buy, risking a deep recession. And as the old saying goes, when the nation catches a cold, Michigan catches pneumonia.
Michigan is expected to be one of the hardest-hit states because of 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and parts. Even U.S.-assembled vehicles will be subject to tariffs because their parts come from many countries.
Detroit automakers won some relief from tariffs on cars and trucks they import from Mexico and Canada. Those vehicles that comply with the terms of the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement are exempt from the tariffs, for now.
But Trump said tariffs on parts components in Canadian-and-Mexican-made vehicles will take effect after the Commerce Department “establishes a process to apply tariffs to their non-U.S. content.”
The tariff exemptions on many vehicles imported from our northern and southern trading partners is cold comfort to Michigan auto industry leaders who warn that tariff-induced costs to Detroit automakers will rise substantially and be passed on to consumers.
“These increased vehicle costs will be disproportionately borne by working-class and middle-class families,” Detroit Regional Chamber President Sandy Baruah and MichAuto Executive Director Glenn Stevens wrote in a letter to Trump administration officials.
Experts say vehicles prices, which are expected to jump by thousands of dollars because of the tariffs, will likely reduce demand for new cars and trucks. And that could lead to lower vehicle production and fewer jobs.
U-M economists were predicting a significant slowdown in Michigan’s economy over the next two years even before the April 3 tariffs took effect.
In a February 28 forecast, the economists said they expected the state to gain 30,200 jobs this year, down from 38,100 last year. Job growth further decelerates in 2026 with the economy producing just 18,500 jobs, according to the U-M forecast.
The major culprit in the jobs malaise is manufacturing, particularly in the auto sector. U-M economists expect the auto and parts manufacturing to lose about 9,000 jobs over the next two years.
Most of the state’s job growth through 2026 is expected to be in service jobs least affected by tariffs.
Trump’s tariffs could greatly accelerate the predicted loss of auto-related and other manufacturing jobs. U-M expects new steel and aluminum tariffs, which took effect last month, to result in the loss of 2,300 auto-related jobs by the end of 2026.
U.S. steel producer Cleveland-Cliffs last month cut 600 jobs in Michigan, citing falling automotive demand.
One of the few people who think the tariffs will be a jobs boon is United Auto Workers union President Shawn Fain, who said Detroit automakers will be forced to bring back to the U.S. jobs that left in droves to Mexico and other low-wage countries. to the U.S.
In a statement, the UAW said automakers could return thousands of jobs to the U.S. in a matter of months by adding production to underutilized plants.
But many experts say it would take years for automakers to build new plants that would substantially increase manufacturing employment in the U.S.
Michigan will be at the epicenter of Trump’s risky experiment to reorder the global manufacturing footprint. Buckle up.

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)When it comes to health, we are all connected. Health policies that impact some can ultimately affect the health of the whole community.
House Bill 135, which imposes citizenship verification requirements for certain benefits like immunizations, testing for communicable diseases, prenatal care, and services like food and shelter, has passed the Idaho Legislature and now goes to the governor. Even though this bill aims to deter illegal immigration, it is just as likely to limit benefits to U.S. citizens and endanger the public’s health.
Idaho Legislature passes bill blocking unauthorized immigrants from public services

The country is facing outbreaks of syphilis, measles and tuberculosis. If we can’t screen and treat infectious diseases in our communities, we put everyone’s health at risk. That’s why we don’t require onerous citizenship documentation for these basic activities, even as immigrants are already blocked from receiving most public benefits and health coverage.
Idahoans value babies getting a healthy start in life, so we have similar exceptions for some pre- and post-natal care and nutrition programs regardless of the mom’s immigration status. The citizenship verification requirements in House Bill 135 could block pregnant women from receiving services that prevent pregnancy and labor complications, as well as birth defects. This policy could have severe and long-lasting consequences for Idaho families.
Some Idaho citizens may not have the required identification handy when they show up to the soup kitchen, the health department, or the mental health crisis center, so House Bill 135 would affect citizens and noncitizens alike. Under this bill, every single Idahoan receiving these services would have to jump through onerous hoops or may be blocked from services even if they are eligible.
Despite health and public health professionals’ warnings, over the past few years the Legislature has passed bills with adverse, unintended consequences to the health of Idahoans. This bill could be one of them.
Besides the issues above, legislators must consider the potential cost of training people on citizenship verification and setting up systems to carry out this task in the various areas impacted by this bill. There is also the cost to frontline providers, who would have to deal with the added bureaucracy and the distress of having to deny services to people in need.
Immigration is an issue that requires addressing, but this is not the way to do it — and certainly not a thoughtful, compassionate way to do it. House Bill 135 endangers the health of families, children and vulnerable people.

Versions of the hemp restriction bill passed Senate and House finance committees this week but with major differences ranging from state regulation and taxes to the little elephant in the room, THCA, a derivative that delivers a high similar to marijuana when decarboxylated (lit). 
The Tennessee Journal reported that the House bill could add considerably more than the Senate bill to state coffers through taxes and fees on hemp products. Extra money could be critical as lawmakers maneuver in the closing days, especially since lawmakers want to put their own pet projects in the state budget instead of the governor’s. The Senate version nets only about $14 million extra in taxes and fees, but it also bans THCA while the House version keeps the buzz factor intact.
Memphis-Shelby schools “takeover” starts in Tennessee subcommittee

In addition to wrangling over near-weed as the kickback trial for former Speaker Glen Casada and ex-chief of staff Cade Cothren approaches, a state takeover of Memphis Shelby County Schools is hitting obstacles with the Senate balking at a plan for the state to appoint a management board to run the school district, superseding the elected school board and administration there. Leadership is not enthused with the idea of putting a board in place that could come back to haunt them, similarly to the Achievement School District, which was deemed a relative failure after 10 years and roughly a billion dollars flushed down the drain.
The Senate bill is wide ranging but a watered-down version of House Education Committee Chairman Mark White’s effort to put a state-appointed board in charge of the school district he says has struggled for decades without direction.
The Senate version allows Tennessee’s education commissioner, with approval from the Department of Education, to remove the schools director or school board members and allow the county commission to replace them. If a school district runs through three district directors in three years, a county mayor could appoint a new director for a four-year term.
The bill also would lift income caps on the Education Savings Account program in effect in Shelby County, the governor’s initial private-school voucher program, and change the process for a public school to become a charter school.
Sounds like a complete face-lift for Memphis public schools.
Republican Sen. Brent Taylor of Memphis, who is carrying the Senate version, predicted the bills would go to a conference committee where differences could be worked out. 
Then again, some bills that wind up in negotiations fail to gain enough traction for passage.
Lawmakers could get stuck, as well, on restricting immigrant children in K-12 schools. The Senate bill sponsored by Republican Sen. Bo Watson of Chattanooga/Hixson would require immigration status checks on students and allow school districts the option to deny children without legal status the chance to go to school or charge their families tuition.

Watson, chairman of the Senate finance committee, made a powerpoint presentation this week displaying how costly it is to teach immigrant children. 
Because of this bill and federal deportation efforts, some already under way, immigrant parents might be keeping kids at home, potentially creating another underclass when, in reality, the kids are just as smart as anyone else, maybe smarter.
The House bill’s biggest contrast is that it gives school districts the option to check immigration status, bound to be a sticking point over the next two weeks and putting the bill in position to go through negotiations – or nowhere.
State troopers removed opponents of the bill from the Senate’s committee meeting room this week, including 80-year-old Lynne McFarland, who looked quite comfortable in the arms of a Tennessee patrol officer. She was later jailed for allegedly disturbing the meeting.
In light of the photo taken by the Tennessee Lookout’s John Partipilo, the idea was floated for installation of conveyor belts in committee rooms, enabling protesters and others wrongly accused of making noise to be loaded up and moved out. We don’t need our troopers straining their backs and making needless worker’s comp claims – especially over unconstitutional bills that are designed to challenge Supreme Court precedent but are more likely to dredge up old prejudices.
A bill for big business
Typically, you’re supposed to give a nod to the golf gods before making a backswing. At least that’s what Kevin Costner said in “Tin Cup.” 
In the legislature’s case, it’s giving a nod to the business gods, those who make big contributions to campaign accounts. 
Case in point, the Senate voted 21-7 Thursday to pass the Bayer/Monsanto bill enabling companies to dodge liability in case a farmer contracts cancer after spreading the company’s Roundup, all based, of course, on the product’s label. The company is facing more than 170,000 lawsuits over its product, and Germany-based Bayer, the parent company of Monsanto, recently agreed to pay nearly $2.1 billion to a man who claimed he contracted non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma from Roundup.
Oddly enough, the Farm Bureau and farmers, even though they are more likely to get sick from the pesticide/herbicide, support the bill because the stuff they spray on plants and weeds is said to enable them to farm larger tracts more efficiently. 
The bill’s sponsor, Republican Sen. John Stevens of Huntingdon, read a letter Thursday from former U.S. Rep. Stephen Fincher of Frog Jump who claimed farmers need “common-sense protections” to be able to spray the stuff, which has gone through “rigorous” testing with the U.S. Environmental Protection as the “gold standard.” Oh yes, and without the fear of political motivation.



Whaddya know! Sen. John Stevens, a Huntingdon Republican and sponsor of a bill holding Bayer — the German based parent company of Monsanto — harmless for cancer caused by the company’s products, has taken $12,000 from both Bayer and a lobbying firm that represents — you guessed it — Bayer. 			


It’s always funny to hear lawmakers brag about the federal government on one hand and then kick it around when convenient.
Stevens received $12,000 from Bayer over the past five years and $15,000 from BIV-PAC, a lobbying firm’s political action committee. The Farm Bureau is playing a heavy role in this semi-fight too.
Democrats spoke against the bill Thursday morning, with Sen. Heidi Campbell calling it “crazy” to protect big chemical companies instead of the rights of people to sue over products that darn near kill them.
Stevens countered by saying consumers can continue to sue but not over the product’s label. This means we’re depending on the EPA and the manufacturer to do the right thing and not put cancer-causing chemicals on the market.
But as long as we can get a few more bushels of corn per acre, does it really matter?
Incidentally, along with Democrats, Republican Sens. Rusty Crowe and Janice Bowling voted against the bill while Sens. Mark Pody and Kerry Roberts were present not voting, which equals a no vote. It takes a lot of people to die before you can find nine votes in the Senate.
Out of existence
The late, great Richard Stockard (my father) was ahead of his time and didn’t know it. An English and Spanish teacher for nearly 35 years, he called all students by their last name. He also employed the paddle frequently to send a message, although in later years after softening up, he would simply kick unruly students out of class, then go out and paddle the bottom of his shoe to make a lot of noise and then tell them to act like they were hurting. Those scare tactics never worked with me.
Anyway, using students’ last names made it easier to remember everyone years afterward, and he never had to worry about using pronouns, which has reached epidemic proportions in Tennessee, to the point we need state laws to make sure boys are referred to as “he” and girls are called “she.” Thank you, Archie Bunker.
And with a nod to Archie (there we go nodding again), the Senate passed SB937 Thursday making sure people such as teachers can’t be sued for using or refusing to use names or pronouns that don’t match a student’s sex at birth. The bill also allows civil suits to be filed against employers and public schools that allow a student’s preferred pronoun to be used without parental permission.
  A solution in search of a problem: A bill proposed by Sen. Paul Rose, a Covington Republican, would make educators liable for using a student’s preferred pronouns. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Does that mean it’s OK to refer to a girl as “he,” as long as parents approve, but that parental permission means nothing when it comes to gender affirming care? I reckon so.
Democratic Sen. Jeff Yarbro of Nashville argued during Thursday’s debate that the bill, if it becomes law, and it probably will, will “create more fights.”
The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Paul Rose of Covington, countered by saying today’s youths have been led to believe there are more than two sexes created by God and that they can change the sex from which they were born. 
“This is common-sense legislation,” Rose said.
Inside and outside the chamber, we could detect the faint sound of Tennessee’s government slowly, but surely, expanding. And you know what that means: Don’t call me Shirley. But if you do, make sure you use “she” or you’ll wind up in court.
“We’re gonna have a party, y’all”
Fresh off a two-week prison sentence that morphed downward from 21 months, thanks to President Donald Trump, former state Sen. Brian Kelsey is holding (yes, you guessed it) a pardon party.
The crack investigative reporters with the Tennessee Journal unearthed an invitation from the former Germantown Republican for a party this weekend to celebrate his pardon. No doubt, the president will attend since birds of a feather flock together?
It’s always nice to see happy endings.
But what we have here is a case in which Kelsey funneled more than $80,000 from his state campaign account through two political action committees to the American Conservative Union, which paid for ads to bolster his flagging 2016 congressional run, which flopped. 
  Ain’t no party like a pardon party: Former Sen. Brian Kelsey, who pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance violations, celebrations his get-out-of-jail-free card.
It might be a bad law, but it’s illegal to use state funds for a federal campaign because they’re gathered under different rules.
Kelsey knew it was wrong and pleaded guilty but then had what “alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity” and decided he didn’t break the law and was given bad advice by his attorneys. He claimed he was also affected by the birth of twin sons and the looming death of his father, both of which are stressful (not joking). But he also said he didn’t understand criminal law, even though he earned a law degree from Georgetown and served as Senate Judiciary chairman. But enough background.
Kelsey had $197,519 in his state account before transferring it to his Red State Political Action Committee on June 1, 2023. His PAC received $1,000 from the Haile PAC of Sen. Ferrell Haile last year and $250 from the Faison Freedom PAC of Rep. Jeremy Faison, in addition to transferring $15,000 to a federal PAC account.
The Registry of Election Finance wouldn’t let him use his state funds to pay legal fees. But he might be able to use that money to finance this weekend’s party. That is, if he pretends to be running for re-election after receiving a full pardon, which would, presumably, allow him to renew voting and gun-carry rights.
Sounds like a lot of fun. Too bad I didn’t get an invitation. Maybe former, expelled Rep. Jeremy Durham, an unnamed conspirator in the case, got one. Psyche.

(Chris Jackson | West Virginia Watch)While facing the huge uncertainty around proposed federal cuts to food banks, SNAP and school feeding programs, county officials have been sounding the alarm that if their county jail bills keep increasing, they do not know how their counties can afford funding popular, non-mandated services like senior centers and food banks. 
Instead of taking seriously these fiscal concerns raised by county officials, state lawmakers have been moving legislation that would make the problem of hefty jail bills tremendously worse, funnel millions more dollars into the failed war on drugs, while providing no additional funding for prevention and treatment programs proven to work.
Senate Bill 196, which has already passed the Senate, proposes 21 increased penalties for drug offenses when the research is clear that higher penalties will not deter drug trafficking or reduce the demand for drugs.  
Not only are policies like SB 196 fiscally irresponsible, but according to recent polling data, they’re also very unpopular among West Virginia voters. 
SB 196 was rushed through the Senate under a false narrative that it solely targets fentanyl, when the truth is that SB 196 would triple the minimum time a person must serve in prison from one year to three years, for drug offenses that do not include fentanyl.
Let that sink in. SB 196 would triple the minimum incarceration time for drug offenses like possession with intent to deliver, the most common drug offense, which most often ensnares people suffering from substance use disorder.
SB 196 will have a major impact on our state budget due to the increased mandatory minimum prison sentences, and the biggest financial hit will be felt directly by counties. Higher penalties will result in higher bonds, which will lead to more people spending more days incarcerated pretrial, which are per diem days paid for by the county.

While all 55 counties can expect jail bills to increase if SB 196 passes, and all tax payers can expect to pay millions more for prison costs, it’s the poorest counties who stand to lose the most. 
Take for example Clay County, home county of the Speaker of the House of Delegates. Clay County has the smallest budget in the state ($1.7 million). According to analysis of Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation data by the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, last year Clay County used 286.3 percent of its allotted jail days, resulting in a jail bill that was equal to 39.9 percent of the county’s total budget. Currently, Clay County has a jail bill debt that is roughly twice the value of its annual budget. SB 196 is poorly considered policy that would break the budgets of our poorest counties. 
Recent polling conducted by pollster Mark Blankenship also reveals significant concern among voters regarding increasing criminal penalties and incarceration costs. Nearly 6 in 10 Republicans in West Virginia believe it is important to reduce the jail and prison population in the state. The results are not surprising as they come at a time when the state is spending more to incarcerate a single person annually than the average income for someone working in the state, costing taxpayers over $420 million on its prisons and jails during the 2024 fiscal year.
Some other highlights from the poll include:

Voters believe the best way to keep West Virginia communities safe is through investment in prevention, housing, job training, and drug and mental health treatment (65%) rather than increased jail and prison sentences (32%).  
Six in 10 voters support reducing criminal penalties for possession of controlled substances and treating drug use as a public health issue, including a majority (56%) of Republicans.
Six in 10 Republicans support eliminating mandatory minimums for drug offenses.

SB 196 and bills like it threaten to undo some of the progress the legislature has made in recent years prioritizing treatment and reducing barriers to reentry. West Virginians agree: If our lawmakers want to be tough on crime, then they should spend our tax dollars on prevention and treatment, not on more of the same failed and costly policies of the past.

Andy Beshear almost two years ago as they briefed media on the mass shooting at the Old National Bank on April 10, 2023 in Louisville. (Photo by Michael Swensen/Getty Images)Two years ago, on April 10, a mentally unstable 25-year-old walked into Old National Bank in Louisville and shot five people to death — Thomas Elliott, James Tutt Jr., Juliana Farmer, Joshua Barrick, Deana Eckert — and injured eight, including Nickolas Wilt, a young police officer who was shot in the head and miraculously survived.
Two years ago, Dr. Jason Smith, the chief medical officer at University of Louisville Hospital, called on lawmakers to address gun violence. “To everyone who helps make policy, both at state, city, (and) federal levels – I would simply ask you to do something. Because doing nothing — which is what we’ve been doing — is not working.”
Two years later, Kentucky’s powerful GOP supermajority has still done absolutely nothing.
In the closing hours of the 2025 General Assembly, during which they did not so much as breathe the words “gun violence” or “firearm safety,” Rep. Bill Wesley appeared outside a women’s restroom to tackle what he clearly believes is the real threat to public safety: a drag queen standing outside the women’s restroom. 
Why? Because Republicans know what sells. They know the sick curiosity about what’s between someone’s legs – not real issues like gun deaths – is political gold.
For all the talk of Democrats running recently on “the trans issue” (a wholly made-up thing) this has been a GOP-instigated rallying cry from the start. Republicans, in the summer of 2022, suddenly found themselves desperately in need of a new culture war strategy.
The overturning of Roe v. Wade left Republicans across the country flat-footed as they lost the one issue they could count on, the battering ram they’d used for decades to drive donations and voters to the polls. With abortion suddenly illegal in many states, including Kentucky, they needed a new cudgel, a sure thing to get and keep voters’ attention, and they found it — akin to the issue of pregnancy and abortion — in the curiosity of what goes on between people’s legs.
  Rep. TJ Robert posted on X. (Screenshot)
If this sounds blunt or sick or crass to you, it’s because it is. 
It is also the truth.
The morning after Wesley bullied a trans woman outside the women’s restroom — and that is what he did, bullied someone with no power for show — the story, along with video and photos, was all over social media. 
Wesley’s buddies in the House publicly cheered him on. Rep. Ryan Dotson wrote on Facebook, “I’m so proud of State Representative Bill Wesley as he protected 2 young girls and their mother from going in to the Women’s restroom after a man dressed like a woman goes in,” and Rep. TJ Roberts posted on X, “Very thankful for KSP and @realBillWesley for keeping women and girls safe today!”
Wesley now says he will “introduce legislation banning men from using women’s restrooms at the state Capitol following an incident involving a transgender woman in Frankfort.” 
Wow! Look at how fast they can decide to file a bill when it is politically expedient.
Meanwhile, Everytown for Gun Safety reports that an average of 842 Kentuckians die each year from gun violence, at a cost of $9.6 billion each year. But what do we hear, year after year, from Wesley and his chest-pounding, gotta-protect-the-women-folk colleagues on gun violence prevention? Crickets.
As if bullying a Capitol visitor outside the women’s restroom was not enough, Wesley and others made more hay, claiming on social media that he was slapped by state Sen. Karen Berg after they exchanged words about the incident. 
I admit, I was appalled when I first read this, imagining Sen. Berg slapping him in the face, because isn’t that what a slap is? This rumor spread like wildfire.
The problem is that it wasn’t exactly true.
Berg did not slap Wesley on the face. After talking to him, she slapped him on the back of his shoulder as she was walking away. For this – for this! – House Speaker David Osborne permanently banned her from the House floor. 
When I was at church on Sunday, our retired office manager did exactly the same to me as she walked by my pew. “Good to see you!” she said as she passed by, slapping me twice on the back of my shoulder. Did I post all over social media that I was slapped at church? Should my minister ban this woman from church? Of course not. Because that would be ridiculous.
And that is what the entire Bill Wesley incident has been — ridiculous — but it sure has gotten him a lot of attention.
Two years have passed since the Old National Bank mass shooting. 
Two years since Dr. Smith addressed the media. “To be honest with you, we barely had to adjust our operating room schedule to be able to do this. That’s how frequent we are having to deal with gun violence in our community,” he said. “I’ll tell you personally, I’m weary. … I’m more than tired, I’m weary. There’s only so many times you can walk into a room and tell someone their (loved one)] is not coming home tomorrow. And it just breaks your heart when you hear someone screaming mommy, or daddy, it just becomes too hard, day in and day out, to be able to do that.”
Two years.
And what have our lawmakers — our powerful Republican supermajority — done to address Dr. Smith’s concerns? Not one damn thing. They are too busy touting their sick obsession with genitalia because that is what brings in the donations and brings out their voting base.
Need proof?
Hours after the 2025 General Assembly ended, after he and others had been wildly posting and making hay of his dramatic bathroom brouhaha, Rep. Bill Wesley posted on his Facebook page, “I came home from a good session being in Frankfort, and to come home to find out that the Democrat party is already sending out somebody door knocking to have me replaced. I didn’t even get home to rest any (sic) But so be it, let the race begin. If anybody wants to give to my campaign, I would greatly appreciate it. Just hit on the link below. It’s called Win Red. Thank you.”
Rep. Bill Wesley was not protecting women and girls at our state Capitol; he was not slapped in the face by a female senator; he went viral on social media and then asked for donations to his campaign.
The Kentucky GOP proves year after year after year that they do not care one bit about your safety from real threats like gun violence.
They care about what gets your attention.
They care about what brings in the money honey, so they can be reelected and keep their supermajority and do absolutely nothing again next year.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) EDITOR’S NOTE — This story includes discussion of suicide.
A newly surfaced recording of Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears is drawing sharp criticism from Democrats and federal employee unions, who say her remarks downplaying the impact of recent federal layoffs show a disregard for the thousands of Virginians — many of them veterans — who have lost their jobs under President Donald Trump’s administration’s workforce cuts.
In the clip, released last week by the progressive media outlet Meidas Touch, Earle-Sears is heard downplaying concerns from federal workers about job losses tied to Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has already axed more than 6,000 veterans and is on track to cut at least 80,000 VA employees nationwide, according to the Associated Press.
In the recording, which appears to be from a March 13 gathering, Earle-Sears addresses the recent federal layoffs tied to Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). 
“Now I’m hearing about DOGE and all of that,” she begins, before quickly shifting to a broader defense of Virginia’s job market. She insists that “we don’t want folks to lose their jobs,” but points to what she says are “over 250,000 jobs that we’ve created since we’ve been in office” as evidence of economic strength.
Earle-Sears then pivots to suggest that job loss is a common experience, asking the crowd, “How many here have ever lost a job?” When some respond affirmatively, she continues: “Oh, you mean it’s not unusual? It happens to everybody all the time? Okay.” She concludes by criticizing the media coverage surrounding the layoffs, saying, “The media is making it out to be this huge, huge thing. And I don’t understand why.”
The reaction from union officials and political opponents was swift.
“She was caught on tape saying she doesn’t know why this is a huge deal,” said Christine Surette, national vice president for the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) District 4 and a former VA employee. 
“I’ve had to console employees who were laid off, who don’t know how they’ll make rent. Some have taken their own lives. Sears isn’t on the side of Virginians,” Surette said on a Zoom call set up by the Democratic Party of Virginia Thursday. 
Earle-Sears, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran herself, is currently leading the pack in the Republican gubernatorial primary and has leaned heavily into her alignment with Gov. Glenn Youngkin and, despite disavowing him more than two years ago, Trump. 
The layoffs, which have significantly affected Virginia’s large population of veteran federal employees, are part of a broader federal workforce reduction effort launched under Trump’s second-term agenda of fiscal reset.
A spokeswoman for Earle-Sears’ campaign declined to comment, but pointed to a video the lieutenant governor posted on X, formerly Twitter, in February, where she expressed empathy for federal workers facing layoffs.
“I have been in your shoes and I totally understand what it is to not know how the next paycheck is coming,” Earle-Sears said in the video. “I know it from being an employee and I also know it from being a small business owner, and so I want to say this to you that we see you.”
At the same time, she reaffirmed her support for Trump’s efforts to cut federal spending — even if it results in job losses. 
“Our government, without question, owes us answers to how the money is being spent,” she said. “We work very hard for those dollars in order for the government to tax us, and so the government must be accountable to us and tell us how it is spending our hard earned dollars.”
Earle-Sears added that it’s also important to ensure support is available for those who lose their jobs and want to pursue new opportunities. 
“It is also a given that we want to make sure that you have the money that you need to find a job or if you want to start a new career or even to go into business and how to do that,” she said.
Earle-Sears went on to promote Youngkin’s plan to connect laid-off federal employees with new job opportunities in Virginia.
But her critics say the damage is done.
“She’s talking about someone’s life being turned upside down,” said Monique Samuels, president of AFGE Local 1992, which represents Defense Logistics Agency workers in Richmond. “Losing a job in any situation is devastating. With thousands of Virginians facing layoffs, there will be a larger economic impact that will hurt every Virginian, but Sears doesn’t care.”
The layoffs have already disrupted essential services at facilities like the Hampton VA Medical Center, where 12 employees initially lost their jobs although one later was allowed to return, and the soon-to-open clinic in Chesapeake, where local lawmakers are already raising concerns about staffing levels. 
“We were struggling before,” said Sheila Elliott, president of AFGE Local 2328. “We’re already seeing appointments being rescheduled because doctors and nurses can’t do their jobs because they don’t have the tools that they need to get that job done. Yesterday we received 50 messages, people are worried about what’s happening next.”
Former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor, also weighed in.
“Virginia’s federal employees are real people with real bills to pay,” she said in a statement. “Now is not the time for the lieutenant governor to put blind ideology and allegiance to a political party ahead of the livelihoods of our neighbors and the strength of Virginia’s economy.”
Virginia is home to the Pentagon, multiple military bases and one of the highest veteran populations nationwide. Many of those veterans transition into federal civilian roles after their service — jobs that have become increasingly precarious as DOGE enacts mass terminations in the name of “efficiency.”
“I understand firsthand the importance of ensuring that our VAs are fully staffed and prepared to care for and support the men and women who have served our country. And right now, that’s all at risk,” said Ottis Johnson, AFGE District 14 vice president and a veteran himself. 
“As VA and employees are facing layoffs, our veterans earned their benefits, and they deserve better than threats to their care. But it is not just veterans who are at risk because of these attacks on federal jobs. Virginia’s economy depends on federal jobs. People are going to feel this in every corner of the commonwealth.”
Less than a week after the leaked remarks were recorded, Earle-Sears appeared alongside Youngkin at a March 19 event in Richmond where both officials defended the job cuts as part of a larger plan for national economic health.
“Today, we know we have a federal government that is facing huge fiscal issues with $37 trillion in debt, with $2 trillion being added every year,” Youngkin said. “What that requires is real action quickly.”
Earle-Sears echoed the message, calling Virginia “resilient” and citing CNBC’s ranking of the commonwealth as the top state for business in 2024. Both touted the state’s Virginia Has Jobs platform, which they say lists over 250,000 available positions for displaced workers.
But union leaders say those promises don’t match reality.
“These workers can’t just walk into another job next week,” said Surette. “Many are specialized professionals. Some are still waiting on severance. And in the meantime, veterans are waiting on appointments, prescriptions, and essential services.”
Surette added that the disruption goes far beyond temporary economic turbulence, but that it strikes at the heart of the values many federal employees hold. 
“These are people who dedicated their lives to serving others … many of them twice, first in uniform and then in federal agencies. They deserve more than lip service. They deserve respect, support, and stability.”

(Patrick Myers, National Park Service/1.0)Having lived in Colorado for over 45 years, I have had the privilege of enjoying our public lands on the Eastern Plains, mountains, and Western Slope. I love our outdoors for its multitudes of recreational opportunities that Coloradans have enjoyed.
In 2023, Bureau of Land Management lands in Colorado contributed $8.8 billion to our economy and provided 39,000 jobs. Our public lands provide clean water and they filter pollutants, as well as provide crucial habitat that allow us to see pronghorn, bald eagles, and native wildlife in their natural habitat. Public lands generate substantial revenue through recreation and tourism while also providing invaluable ecological and quality-of-life benefits.
But these wild places are at more risk than ever. The new administration is taking action to undermine their protection. It has begun the process to disassemble the balance of how outdoor spaces are used and managed — inviting in more industrial activity at the expense of outdoor recreation, wildlife, and the preservation of cultural sites.
Bedrock environmental and cultural resource protection laws such as the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Act, and the 1906 Antiquities Act are being evaluated for dismantlement. As a result, our public lands could be further disrupted for short-term, private economic gain. Sell-offs of public lands for private gain would not benefit the general public. Rather, we would lose things that we would not get back. Coloradans recognize our public lands’ importance. According to a 2025 Colorado College State of the Rockies poll, over two-thirds of Coloradans oppose public land sell-offs.

Public lands are a source of health, prosperity and pride — they should not be profit playgrounds for industrial development. That is why I was glad for the recent passage of Colorado Senate Joint Resolution 25-9, a bipartisan affirmation of Colorado’s commitment to the protection of its public lands that highlights their economic, recreational, cultural and environmental importance. I urge our Colorado congressional delegation to follow the lead our state Legislature has taken on this issue by opposing efforts to sell, transfer or privatize these lands.
U.S. Rep. Jeff Hurd’s district in southwest Colorado includes many acres of our public lands, like Mesa Verde National Park, a site especially significant to Colorado’s cultural heritage, and the Great Sand Dunes National Park, a geographical wonder and certified International Dark Sky Park where people can first-hand witness the splendor of nighttime views.
But it is not only our world class national parks, but also our national conservation areas — such as Dominguez-Escalante, Gunnison Gorge, and McInnis Canyons, as well as the numerous national forests and public rangelands — while lesser known, also hold tremendous historic significance, geologic diversity and wilderness quality. I personally have hiked in all of these special places with my family and friends, and have enjoyed the solitude and open space these special places offer to all Coloradans, and the visitors we attract from across the country.
 As Colorado continues to grow, and endures more pressure on our federally owned lands, maintaining these precious spaces, and preventing access restrictions, or transfer of ownership to private and industrial entities, becomes increasingly important to us longtime Coloradans, and newcomers, who have already experienced residential and commercial development, up to or close to the borders of these lands. We have directly seen what historic mineral exploitation and the associated contamination from these activities has done to scar many of these once  natural spaces.
These damages bring high remediation and ecological costs, which require money we can increasingly not afford due to the fiscal restraints we are experiencing both on the state and federal level. We must value what beautiful land we have left and learn from this past, damaging exploitation.
Lastly, we know that preventing the further degradation and loss of these natural spaces is important to mitigate the impact of climate change as these lands are important ecosystems for surface and groundwater storage that help minimize the flooding disasters and drought that are becoming increasingly common.
Political parties do not make a difference — we who enjoy the outdoors want our open spaces managed sensibly for our future generations, and the future of our planet.

Helen Haskell’s 15-year-old son, Lewis, died after surgery in 2000 because weekend hospital staffers didn’t realize he was in shock. The episodes turned both women into advocates for patients and spurred research that made American health care safer.
On April 1, the Trump administration slashed the organization that supported that research — the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ — and fired roughly half of its remaining employees as part of a perplexing reorganization of the federal Health and Human Services Department.
Haskell, of Columbia, South Carolina, has done research and helped write AHRQ-published surveys and guidebooks on patient engagement for hospitals. The dissolution of AHRQ is dislodging scores of experienced patient-safety experts, a brain drain that will be impossible to rectify, she said.
Survey data gathered by AHRQ provides much of what is known about hospitalizations for motor accidents, measles, methamphetamine, and thousands of other medical issues.
“Nobody does these things except AHRQ,” she said. “They’re all we’ve got. And now the barn door’s closed.”
HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. posted on the social platform X on April 1 that layoffs at HHS, aimed at reducing the department’s workforce by about 20,000 employees, were the result of alleged inefficacy. “What we’ve been doing isn’t working,” he said. “Despite spending $1.9 trillion in annual costs, Americans are getting sicker every year.”
But neither Kennedy nor President Donald Trump have explained why individual agencies such as AHRQ were targeted for cuts or indicated whether any of their work would continue.
At their first meeting with the leadership of AHRQ last month, officials from Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency said that they didn’t know what the agency did — and that its budget would be cut by 80% to 90%, according to two people with knowledge of the meeting who were granted anonymity because of fears of retribution.
On March 28, the administration said AHRQ would merge with HHS’ Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.
An AHRQ spokesperson, Rachel Seeger, said its acting chief, Mamatha Pancholi, was unavailable to answer questions.
Created on the foundation of an earlier agency in 1999, AHRQ has had two major functions: collecting survey data on U.S. health care expenditures, experiences, and outcomes; and funding research aimed at improving the safety and delivery of health care. It also has published tools and guidelines to enhance patient safety.
Its latest budget of $513 million amounts to about 0.04% of HHS spending.










There are all kinds of terrible things about our health care system’s outcomes and how we pay for it, the most expensive care in the world. “Without AHRQ, we’d be doing even worse.


– Richard Kronick, University of California-San Diego researcher and former AHRQ head


Newly sworn-in FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, a surgeon who has advocated for patient safety, wrote or co-authored at least 10 research papers supported by AHRQ funding since 1998. AHRQ research and guidelines played a key role in lowering the incidence of hospital-acquired infections — such as deadly blood infections caused by contaminated IV lines, which fell 28% from 2015 to 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Medical residents training in the 1980s were taught that such infections were an inevitable, often fatal byproduct of heart surgery, but AHRQ-funded research “showed that fairly simple checklists about preventing infections would be effective at going to zero,” said Richard Kronick, a University of California-San Diego researcher who led AHRQ from 2013 to 2016.
Medical errors caused by missed diagnoses, drug errors, hospital infections, and other factors kill and maim tens of thousands of Americans each year. Makary published a controversial study in 2016 hypothesizing that errors killed 250,000 people a year in the U.S. — making medical mistakes the nation’s third-leading cause of death.
“There are all kinds of terrible things about our health care system’s outcomes and how we pay for it, the most expensive care in the world,” Kronick said. “Without AHRQ, we’d be doing even worse.”
AHRQ-funded researchers such as Hardeep Singh at Baylor College of Medicine have chipped away at patient safety risks for more than two decades. Singh devises ways to integrate technologies like telemedicine and artificial intelligence into electronic health records to alert doctors to potential prescribing errors or misdiagnoses.
Singh has 15 scholars and support staff members supported by three AHRQ grants worth about $1.5 million, he said. The elimination of the agency’s office that funds outside researchers, among the cuts announced this week, is potentially “career-ending,” he said. “We need safety research to protect our patients from harms in health care. No organization in the world does more for that than AHRQ.”
Republicans have long been skeptical of AHRQ and the agency that preceded it. Some doctors saw it as meddling in their medical practices, while some GOP Congress members viewed it as duplicating the mission of the National Institutes of Health.
But when the Trump administration proposed merging it with NIH in 2018, a House-ordered study into health research priorities validated AHRQ’s valuable role.
Now, the naysayers have triumphed.
Gordon Schiff, a Harvard Medical School internist who has received AHRQ funding since 2001, was among the first to learn about policy changes there when in February he got an email from the editors of an AHRQ patient-safety website informing him “regretfully” that a 2022 case study on suicide prevention he co-authored had been removed “due to a perception that it violates the White House policy on websites ‘that inculcate or promote gender ideology.’”
The article was not about gender issues. It briefly mentioned that LGBTQ men were at a higher risk for suicide than the general population. Schiff was offered the option of removing the LGBTQ reference but refused. He and Harvard colleague Celeste Royce have sued AHRQ, HHS, and the Office of Personnel Management over removal of the article.
“All we were doing was presenting evidence-based risk factors from the literature,” he said. “To censor them would be a violation of scientific integrity and undermine the trustworthiness of these websites.”
PSNet, the AHRQ publication where Schiff and Royce’s article appeared, has been dissolved, although its website was still up as of April 2. Roughly half of AHRQ’s 300 staffers resigned following the initial DOGE warning; 111 staff members were fired April 1, according to an email that a top executive, Jeffrey Toven, sent to employees and was shown to KFF Health News. AHRQ’s remaining leadership was in the dark about Kennedy’s plans, he said.
HHS spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment. Stephen Parente, a University of Minnesota finance professor who said he consults informally with Trump health officials, said much of AHRQ’s work could be done by others. Its most vital services have been surveys that Westat, a private research company, performs for AHRQ on contract, said Parente, who was chief economist for health policy in the first Trump administration.
At the height of the COVID pandemic, he said, data produced by AHRQ and other government sources were outclassed by private sources. To track COVID, he relied on daily feeds of private insurance data from around the country.
Still, Parente said, the virtual disappearance of AHRQ means “we’re going to lose a culture of research that is measured, thoughtful, and provides a channel for young investigators to make their marks.”
An AHRQ official said he was “generally skeptical” that AHRQ’s merger with the assistant secretary’s office would keep its mission alive. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the CDC conduct some health system quality research, but they are also losing staff, Harvard’s Schiff noted.
One of Schiff’s current AHRQ projects involved interviewing late-stage cancer patients to determine whether they could have been diagnosed earlier.
“The general public, I think, would like cancer to be diagnosed earlier, not when it’s stage 4 or stage 3,” he said. “There are things we could learn to improve our care and get more timely diagnosis of cancer.”
“Medical errors and patient safety risks aren’t going to go away on their own,” he said.
With input from Sheridan and other mothers of children who suffered from jaundice-related brain damage, AHRQ launched research that led to a change in the standard of care whereby all newborns in the U.S. are tested for jaundice before discharge from hospitals. Cases of jaundice-related brain damage declined from 7 per 100,000 to about 2 per 100,000 newborns from 1997 to 2012.
The misfortune of Lewis, Haskell’s son, led to a change in South Carolina law and later to a national requirement for hospitals to enable patients to demand emergency responses under certain circumstances.
Singh, a leading researcher on AI in health care, sees bitter irony in the way the Elon Musk-led DOGE has taken an ax to AHRQ, which recently put out a new request for proposals to study the technology. “Some think AI will fix health care without a human in the loop,” Singh said. “I doubt we get there by dismantling people who support or perform patient safety research. You need a human in the loop.”

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin tried to amend a bill that would require school boards to send annual notifications to parents about safe storage of prescription drugs and firearms, by adding a provision to prohibit schools from disclosing students’ gender identity questions to parents.
During the legislature’s one-day veto session on Wednesday, Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said the governor’s tweak had nothing to do with the legislation, before lawmakers effectively rejected the change. The Senate initially opted to “pass by” the companion bill for the day, before rejecting it outright.
Lawmakers push back on Youngkin budget, pass bipartisan bills on probation, dangerous driving

The bill now heads back to Youngkin for consideration, but is at risk of being vetoed, since both branches failed to compromise.
Peter Finocchio, a spokesman for the governor, reiterated Youngkin’s support for parents.
“In Virginia, parents have a fundamental right to make decisions on their child’s upbringing, care, and education,” said Finocchio in a statement.
The legislation, carried by Del. Laura Jane Cohen, D-Fairfax, and Sen. Stella Pekarsky, D-Fairfax, would have tasked school boards in each district to send parents annual reminders about safely storing guns and prescription medications via email as well as text messages, if possible. The bill stipulated that school boards provide these reminders in more than one language and post them on the school district’s website.
Youngkin’s amendment would have required schools to notify at least one parent if a student seeks help from a social worker regarding their gender identity. Schools would also need parental permission before starting any plan to help students manage their gender feelings.
On Wednesday, Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, said the governor’s amendment has “absolutely nothing to do with the underlying bill” before asking Scott to determine if the governor’s amendment was germane.
“The governor’s recommendation strays from this original purpose by requiring notification to certain parents in limited instances, a much more specific and targeted notification not related to the subject of the original bill,” Scott concluded. “Therefore, the governor’s recommendation is not germane.”
Cohen agreed that the governor’s recommendation has no relevance to her proposal. She said this is an opportunity for him to show, as he says often, that he cares about kids. 
“I feel like the governor has the opportunity to, again, do the right thing,” Cohen said. “We’re sending it back to his desk, and he can choose to do the right thing and actually take some good preventive steps on making sure that we keep our kids safe from accidental poisonings and from accidental shootings.”
The language proposed by the governor is similar to a bill, carried by Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper, which the House failed to take up during the regular session for a second straight year. Freitas’ bill, also known as Sage’s Law, was introduced by then-Republican Del. Dave LaRock during the 2023 General Assembly Session. It successfully passed in a Republican-controlled House, but died in the Senate controlled by Democrats. 
“While Sage’s Law did not even receive a hearing during the legislative session, parents have spoken loudly on this commonsense issue,” Youngkin spokesman Finocchio said.
Last year, lawmakers rejected the governor’s amendment for a similar proposal carried by Cohen and Pekarsky that would have required lawmakers to vote again on the notification bill for a second year. The amendment also prioritized parents by requiring the Virginia Department of Education to work with subject experts to create a list of parental rights and responsibilities and plan for distributing the list to parents.
“For the second year in a row, the governor has refused to address the substance of my bill,” Pekarsky said, naming gun and prescription drug safety and school-parent partnership as the goals of her measure.
“The governor refused to center the safety of children,” she said, “and instead took the opportunity to play politics with their safety.”

This week: More transparency in Richmond, a Prince William prosecutor must pay up for FOIA violations, and Virginia’s connection to the Epstein files. 
 After water crisis, Richmond launches FOIA reading room to bolster transparency

In a move aimed at restoring public trust and delivering on campaign promises, Richmond Mayor Danny Avula on Wednesday announced the launch of a new FOIA Reading Room, a public-facing online archive that will provide access to government records tied to the city’s January water crisis.
The effort comes less than three months after a major water emergency tested Avula’s leadership during his first days in office — and sparked dozens of records requests from residents, journalists and advocacy groups seeking answers.
“I said throughout my campaign and many times over the course of these first three months in office: Transparency is one of my core values,” Avula said in a statement. “The city’s FOIA team has worked incredibly hard over the last several months, and now I’m asking them to do a little bit more.”
The pilot FOIA Reading Room will serve as a central resource for documents of broad public interest that have already been released through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). According to the city, inclusion in the Reading Room is based on the judgment of subject matter experts, the city’s FOIA manager and other officials who determine which records are most likely to be requested again.
“Not every record released through a FOIA request will make its way into the Reading Room, but I hope residents and reporters alike will see this as a good-faith effort towards greater transparency,” Avula said. 
The new transparency measure also includes mandatory annual FOIA training for all city directors and deputy directors — a direct response to concerns over delays and inconsistencies in how departments handle records requests.
Since the January water crisis, Richmond has received 61 separate FOIA requests related to the incident — many of them containing multiple sub-requests — from 22 different individuals. 
About 55 staff members have been involved in fulfilling those requests, with the city taking the standard seven-day extension on 46 of them. Five were returned after the legal deadline, and the city has collected about $1,440 in total fees across all water-related requests.
Julia Holmes, the city’s FOIA manager, said the new reading room is designed to benefit both residents and city staff.
“We wanted to pilot a FOIA Reading Room to promote transparency and accountability, save Richmond residents time and money, and reduce the administrative burden to staff,” Holmes said. “My job, making sure the public has access to public records, is so important, and I’m excited for this new tool that will hopefully make it easier for folks to do that.”
The city said the FOIA Reading Room is still in its pilot phase but plans to expand it if the model proves successful.
Also on Wednesday, the city released the final after-action report from HNTB, the independent firm tasked with investigating the water crisis.
The assessment builds on preliminary and draft findings published in February and March, offering a deeper look into the root causes of the Jan. 6 outage and the city’s response. According to the final report, the crisis began with a complete loss of power at the city’s water treatment plant during a winter storm.
Two critical failures contributed to the prolonged outage: the facility was operating in “winter mode,” which relied on a single key component rather than the more resilient, redundant “summer mode.” At the same time, an automatic switch designed to transfer power to a backup source — known as a “bus tie” — failed to activate.
Together, these breakdowns resulted in an 80-minute loss of power that caused water to flood the plant’s basement, damaging essential electrical equipment and triggering a widespread service disruption.
The report also points to broader issues in the city’s emergency preparedness, including inadequate staffing and training, a lack of standardized operating procedures, and poor communication during the crisis. Several short- and long-term recommendations have already been implemented, officials said, with more concrete steps outlined in the final assessment to strengthen the city’s resilience against future disruptions.
 Prince William prosecutor ordered to pay $22K over FOIA violations

A Virginia judge has ordered Prince William County Commonwealth’s Attorney Amy Ashworth to pay $22,250 after her office violated the state’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) multiple times in response to a records request, InsideNoVa reported. 
The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed in 2023 by Valeria Juarez, a Fairfax County resident who requested 172 emails tied to the prosecution of Kevin Miles Lydon, a man convicted of multiple sexual assault charges between 2016 and 2018. Juarez claimed Ashworth’s office failed to produce the records in a timely manner and over-redacted them once released.
Chief Judge Angela Lemmon Horan of Prince William County Circuit Court found six FOIA violations in total, including a failure to provide records within the required 60-day period and insufficient explanations for withheld information.
“(Ashworth’s office) violated FOIA when they failed to ‘identify with reasonable particularity the subject matter of withheld portions,’” the court order states.
“There is no doubt that [the office] violated the FOIA statute numerous times and in numerous ways over more than a one-year period,” Horan added, pointing to delays and continued noncompliance over an 18-month span.
Ashworth’s office has filed a motion for reconsideration, asking the court to vacate the attorney’s fees award. In an email to InsideNoVa, Ashworth said her office “disagrees with the judge’s ruling.”
The motion argues Juarez did not “substantially prevail” in the case, citing a 2022 court ruling and claiming she received the requested documents before the lawsuit began. It also contends the fee award would be “unjust,” citing the volume of materials provided and delays allegedly caused by Juarez herself.
Judge Horan has paused enforcement of the ruling, pending a hearing on the motion, which has not yet been scheduled.

The Mercury’s efforts to track FOIA and other transparency cases in Virginia are indebted to the work of the Virginia Coalition for Open Government, a nonprofit alliance dedicated to expanding access to government records, meetings and other state and local proceedings.

 Virginia FBI facility at center of Epstein document scramble

The FBI has mobilized hundreds of agents and FOIA analysts at its massive Central Records Complex in Winchester to process thousands of pages of Jeffrey Epstein records — a high-stakes scramble that’s delayed other public records work and intensified pressure on the bureau.
Epstein, previously a financier, died by suicide in prison while awaiting trial for alleged sex trafficking crimes. The internal shift comes after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi claimed that the FBI’s New York field office withheld Epstein files, Bloomberg News reported last week. 
In a Feb. 27 letter to FBI Director Kiran Patel, Bondi demanded the full release of the records, citing a tip from an unnamed source, according to the report. She also ordered an investigation and requested a report on potential “personnel action” within 14 days. The FBI has not said whether that report was completed and declined to comment.
Soon after, FBI employees received a directive — reportedly via text message — to begin working uninterrupted on the Epstein files. Many forwarded the messages to their official accounts to comply with federal recordkeeping laws.
Two people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News that special agents from Washington, D.C., and New York, as well as FOIA analysts and vetting staff, were pulled into the operation. Some employees reportedly logged more than 100 hours over two weeks and even slept on desks during a recent weekend session.
The FBI has already released thousands of Epstein-related documents, mostly from its Miami office, through its public FOIA reading room. But Bondi, during a White House event with far-right influencers like Jack Posobiec, handed out binders labeled “The Epstein Files,” suggesting major revelations — only to be mocked online when the files turned out to be previously released.
Meanwhile, conspiracy theories about Epstein’s connections and death continue to swirl, amplified by figures on the far right who accuse federal agencies of shielding the powerful. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tn., has pressed for more transparency, and FBI Director Patel has pledged to ensure the public “knows the full weight of what happened.”
But for now, as political pressure mounts, the bureau’s FOIA system remains bogged down, with its resources consumed by one of the country’s most infamous scandals.

North Carolina legislators continue not to “get it” when it comes to the state’s ever-worsening plague of gun violence. The latest disturbing example: a bill making its way through the state House that would allow private schools to arm teachers and, conceivably, even some students.
Bill sponsors say their intent is only to facilitate schools having armed security guards, but the bill is actually much broader than that.
As currently written, the legislation would allow anyone lawfully entitled to carry a concealed handgun to carry it on the premises of a private school, so long as they have the school’s permission.
Meanwhile, another bill advancing in Raleigh would allow anyone 18 or older to carry a concealed handgun without any kind of permit — an idea that polls show most North Carolinians think is a dreadful idea.
And together, in a state in which private school leaders have almost complete autonomy, the two measures are an invitation to tragedy.
The bottom line: One prays no school would ever head down this deadly road, but why lawmakers would even consider making it a possibility is impossible to fathom.

(Catherine McQueen/Getty Images)The main source of state funding for Ohio’s public libraries was eliminated in the House draft of the state operating budget for the next two years.
Library advocates say the changes are not in the best interest of Ohioans and could cut services from an area that is still reeling from $27 million in cuts to state funding last year.
The cuts from 2024 put them at the same funding level as they received 25 years ago, despite vastly different technology needs, social service roles, and demand for services.
The Ohio House’s budget draft rejects Gov. Mike DeWine’s executive proposal that would have increased the Public Library Fund from 1.7% to 1.75% of the tax revenue collected in the state’s General Revenue Fund.
Instead, the House version of the budget “establishes a new method of funding public libraries through a direct GRF appropriation,” according to documents.
Distribution of funds would move from the Ohio Department of Taxation to the Ohio Office of Budget and Management, where a new funding formula would send the funding to counties “in proportion to each county’s population,” the budget draft states.

An analysis of the changes in the House proposal by the Ohio Library Council shows state funding would drop by more than $100 million over the biennium compared to what DeWine proposed.
Under the House version, public libraries in 39 counties would see funding cuts via the new distribution formula as soon as the budget is enacted, which is set to happen on July 1.
“Ohio’s public libraries have had a partnership with the state to deliver services at the local level for almost 100 years and that funding is now at risk,” said Michelle Francis, executive director of the Ohio Library Council, in a statement on the House proposal. “Public libraries serve all ages, and funding cuts of this magnitude could jeopardize the vital services that our communities rely on.”
Libraries have not only been sources of reading materials and literacy programs, but over the years have evolved into resources tailored to their areas, with food assistance programs, tax preparation, job training, and employment help. The materials that libraries house have changed as well, with physical materials joined by digital products and broadband access.
A gradual reduction in the Public Library Fund over the decades has created struggles for public libraries, and the need to tap residents for help in the form of property tax levies.
Ohio public libraries, State Library of Ohio, brace for funding uncertainty, hope for budget relief

‘This is censorship’
While potentially cutting public library funding even more, the House version of the budget also asks them to create a new system of shielding certain materials provided by the libraries.
The new budget proposal inserted a provision not included in DeWine’s executive budget, one that would require public libraries to place “material related to sexual orientation or gender identity or expression” in a part of the library that “is not primarily open to the view of minors.”
LGBTQ+ advocacy organization Equality Ohio released a statement strongly opposing the budget proposal as a whole, calling it “the most reckless bill to come out of the Ohio legislature,” including the provision on public library materials.
“Let’s be clear: No public funds should be weaponized to dismantle our rights or erase our existence,” said Dwayne Steward, executive director of Equality Ohio in a statement. “This is censorship. This is harm. And we must resist – together, for a future where every young person can see themselves and their families reflected in their libraries, their schools and their communities.”
Libraries are now also fighting battles on the federal level, where the Institute for Museum and Library Services was threatened with major cuts, and where staff at the agency have been placed on administrative leave as the Trump administration attempts funding cuts all over the federal government.
This funding impacts the State Library of Ohio, which conserves documents connected to the founding and development of Ohio, and works with public libraries in the state on resource-sharing agreements.
An email sent to the State Library of Ohio from the institute on March 31 notified the agency about the administrative leave, also noting that the employees would not be able to respond to emails or provide any information about “future timelines related to this action.”
The Ohio Senate has yet to produce its draft, with which the House draft will need to be merged before a final draft is sent to DeWine for his signature.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Under an emerging Republican plan to require some Medicaid recipients to work, between 4.6 million and 5.2 million adults ages 19 to 55 could lose their health care coverage, according to a new analysis.
The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.
“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.
In Rhode Island, roughly 329,000 people are enrolled in Medicaid, and 74% of those are working, according to 2024 data from KFF Health News.
Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility. In Rhode Island, about 100,000 people are enrolled because of the expansion, KFF data shows.
U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.
Medicaid cuts could hurt older adults who rely on home care, nursing homes

The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.
Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)The House Finance Committee made its final recommendations for the state budget Thursday, sending a package to the full House that significantly cuts spending from Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s proposal, as lawmakers eye low revenues from New Hampshire business taxes.
House Bill 1 and House Bill 2, which have spent weeks in the House committee, will next go for a vote before the full House April 10, and then on to the state Senate. The final budget bills will not emerge until June.
But the House Finance Committee’s proposal reflected a sour outlook on tax revenue for next year — and a difference of opinion between lawmakers and the governor’s office. At the beginning of the process, House Finance Chairman Ken Weyler said that his committee would need to make nearly $800 million in cuts to Ayotte’s budget in order to get it in line with the revenue projections of the House Ways and Means Committee.
On Thursday, the committee passed a budget that achieves that balance, imposing a number of cutbacks to make it happen. Democrats slammed the proposal, and Republicans defended it, arguing that the circumstances required hard choices.
“This was a very difficult budget,” Weyler said. “The economy that has happened in the last few years has been terrible. (There has) been … mismanagement caused by the decisions in Washington, D.C., that have affected us all, and it has lowered the amount of revenue we expected. Obviously, that’s a reason that we have to cut the budget, because the revenue just isn’t there.” 
Rep. Mary Jane Wallner, a Concord Democrat and a former chairwoman of the committee, said, “This budget will have devastating and long-lasting effects on the neediest in our state, and for many more reasons, the minority will vote no.”
Here is a guide to some of what passed.

Slower revenue projections and bigger cuts
Off the bat, the House committee expects New Hampshire will start the next two-year budget period with a bigger revenue shortfall than Ayotte does; while Ayotte’s budget anticipates the state being $81 million behind expectations, the House projects a $149 million hole. That requires the House budget to draw $149 million out of the state’s Rainy Day Fund. (The fund currently has $293 million.) 
To make up for that gap, the House proposes spending less year to year than Ayotte’s budget. It would spend $3.7 billion from the general fund as opposed to Ayotte’s $3.9 billion. And the House budget would shrink the amount spent by the Education Trust Fund; Ayotte has proposed $1.3 billion per year and the House has proposed spending an average of $937 million per year. Under the House proposal some of that education spending would continue in the General Fund. 
To achieve those reductions, the House has recommended a series of cuts. 
Cutting state positions
Much of the reduced spending in the House proposal comes from eliminating positions at New Hampshire departments and agencies. But Weyler stressed that most of those positions are currently vacant.
“We were fortunate, as we looked at the budget, that there were as much as 16% vacancy rates across the board in almost all the agencies,” he said. “Some of those were funded, some were not, but the fact that they’ve been functioning for a year or more at that level of vacancies allowed us to take away those positions.”
The House budget would cut five positions in the Secretary of State’s Office; three in the Insurance Department; 34 in the Liquor Commission; 190 from the Department of Corrections; 14 from the Department of Business and Economic Affairs; eight from the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources; 27 from the Department of Education; and eight from the Department of Safety.
The budget would also institute “back of the budget” cuts to a number of departments — broad reductions that are not targeted to a position or program, but which the agencies must incorporate into their own spending by cutting programs and terminating positions internally.
That includes cuts of $7.9 million to the judicial branch, $600,000 to the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources, $6 million to the Department of Environmental Services, $1 million to the legislative branch, $100,000 to the governor’s office, about $8.7 million to the New Hampshire Retirement System, $14.7 million to the Department of Justice, $10 million to the Department of Information Technology, and $46 million to the Department of Health and Human Services.
Eliminating agencies and commissions
In addition to paring down state agencies, the House budget would eliminate a number of smaller agencies in the state, a move that Republicans say is difficult but necessary, but that Democrats have denounced.
Most prominently, the committee has recommended getting rid of the Office of the Child Advocate, the watchdog agency created under the governorship of Chris Sununu that monitors the Division for Children, Youth, and Families after a series of child fatalities a decade ago.
The committee also recommended axing the State Council on the Arts, which provides grants to local arts programs. It also called for the repeal of the Human Rights Commission, an independent agency that hears civil rights and discrimination complaints and can make recommendations for prosecution to the Attorney General’s Office.
It would ax the state’s right-to-know ombudsman, who adjudicates disputes over public records laws to avoid parties needing to go to court, and the Housing Appeals Board, the newly created panel to speed up planning and zoning board disputes between towns and developers.
And it would cut the Office of Early Childhood Education within the state’s Department of Education. 
Cuts to university system
The House budget would reduce state spending on the University System of New Hampshire by $50 million over the two-year budget.  It would also eliminate the Governor’s Scholarship Fund, cutting $5.4 million over two years. 
The community college system would receive a $4 million cut in funding. 
Limits on funding to cities and towns, Medicaid providers, reproductive health
Among the programs cut by the House Finance Committee is the state’s family planning program, which provides funding to health centers for testing for cancers, sexually transmitted infections, and other health care. The committee has proposed cutting the $839,000 per year appropriated in Ayotte’s budget. 
The budget would also reduce spending in the state’s Medicaid program by $52.5 million in two years, a 3% reduction to providers. HB 2 would prohibit Medicaid from paying for circumcisions, a long-sought goal for Republicans. 
And the budget would also level fund the amount it distributes from the meals and rooms tax to cities and towns to $137 million a year, rather than a percentage amount, which amounts to an $11.2 million cut. 
A bigger expansion of education freedom accounts
While Ayotte had a more conservative approach to expanding universal education freedom accounts — removing income limits only for students who are already in public schools, starting in 2026 — the House has a more expansive approach. The House’s version would expand the income eligibility from 350% of the federal poverty level to 400% in the next school year, and then would make them universal in the 2026-2027 school year. 
The House budget also includes “open enrollment” legislation to allow residents of New Hampshire to attend any public school in the state that has capacity, even if they do not live in that school district. And it included legislation that would cap the amount that local school boards could increase their budgets and require a three-fifths majority vote by school district residents to override that cap. 
Meanwhile, the committee is keeping Ayotte’s mandatory cell phone ban in New Hampshire schools, but it is removing the governor’s grant program intended to help schools implement that policy. The House’s version of the committee also expands on the exemptions: Rather than just applying to students with disabilities, the exemptions also apply to students with medical needs such as insulin pumps and glucose sensors.
Repeal of motor vehicle inspections
Included in the budget is legislation to repeal New Hampshire’s annual requirement for motor vehicle inspections, which also passed the House as a standalone bill, House Bill 649. 
That also allowed House budget writers to eliminate eight positions in the Department of Safety related to the motor vehicle inspection program. 
Curtailing the Education Trust Fund
The House is proposing to curtail the size of the state’s Education Trust Fund, which pays for the state’s share of public schools and other programs such as the education freedom accounts, and is currently running a surplus. 
Ayotte’s budget also recommended that the percentage of revenues that go to the ETF be lowered, but the House recommends that those percentages be lowered further. For instance, 41% of the business profits tax goes to the trust fund currently; Ayotte would lower that to 34% and the House would lower that to 30%.
The real estate transfer tax and the tobacco tax allocations would both also be lowered to 30%.
The House would limit the use of the Education Trust Fund and override some of Ayotte’s proposals. Ayotte’s budget proposed using the fund to help pay for the community college dual and concurrent enrollment program, her cell phone grant program, and operating costs for the Department of Education. 
The House budget would also stop the Education Trust Fund from paying for student data collection and reporting, as well as building aid. Building aid and special education aid would be paid for via general funds.
 An overall increase in state fees

The new budget seeks to expand revenue by increasing a number of fees paid to the state by businesses and individuals. It would double the application fees for terrain alteration applications to the state. It would increase the price of elevator inspection fees, registration fees for dams, dredging and filling fees for wetlands, sewage fees, fees for agricultural products and equipment, fisheries habitat fees, driver’s license card fees, motor vehicle title fees, trucking fees, and vanity plate fees. 
The House budget would also defund the housing champion designation and grant program, which passed in 2023 and is designed to incentivize towns to improve their housing, and it would repeal the state Commission on Aging. 
The budget would create a new license plate: “Love NH Lakes,” which would join the state’s moose plate and provide a way for drivers to support cyanobacteria mitigation efforts for $30 a year. 
Preserving the Group II retirement reimbursements
Perhaps the one area of bipartisan agreement in the budget is the changes to retirement benefits for some state retirees.
In 2011, the Legislature reduced the retirement benefits for a number of “Group II” employees — which include police officers and firefighters — in order to address a shortfall in the state’s retirement system. Those employees have long argued that the state owes them the benefits promised to them; Ayotte’s budget would provide that reimbursement. The House budget preserves that adjustment. 
“As in any budget, there is going to be provisions the minority supports, particularly with respect to the Group II retirement,” said Wallner on Thursday. “But House Bill 2 goes on to take some radical actions.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4033243-House-Finance-1-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-04-04 05:58:48.233334

The farm was one of thousands benefiting from a local food program recently cut by the Trump administration. (Helaina Thompson/Courtesy of Over the Moon Farm)Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
Federal cuts squeeze already-struggling food banks, school lunch programs

The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
A mixed response from states
The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.

“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
Creating a new food system
In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
Democrats and Republicans take on soda, but they’re using different tactics

Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”
